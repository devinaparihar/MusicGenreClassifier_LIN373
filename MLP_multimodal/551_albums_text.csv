0,2,1906063443,"Contrary to the previous review, this IS a compilation, NOT a single artist's CD. I don't know what happened to their CD package - maybe the buyer only received the bonus CD by mistake from the seller, or got some bogus promo CD without the entire package, but believe me, the normal, commercial version of this product includes TWO CDs and liner notes for all the songs, and in our estimation (World Music Network & myself), it's well worth the money. There is a second CD that is an entire album by one of the artists on the first CD. The first CD has a wide range of Roma (gypsy) or Roma-inspired artists from all over the world, from traditional to more modern. I think it's a great collection and I worked on it for a good three months, making it a balanced and well thought out survey. all Rough Guides are quality merchandise, well researched and well respected by critics. Admittedly, most ""guide"" and ""best of"" compilations out there can never do the actual music justice - it's impossible to include everything, and the compiler's taste comes into play and there are of course many limitations to any given Rough Guide or the like due to licensing issues, budget, etc., but I feel I gave this comp my all, and so, The Rough Guide To Gypsy Music deserves a fair shake from you the buyer. I therefore feel I have the record set straight. I urge people interested in this kind of music to give it a try.

1,3,1929243766,"My family and I all first experienced John on Comedy Central. We taped him on our DVR. I bought everything John Pinette made for my husband last year for Christmas. We love to watch the DVD's and we love to listen to the CD's on road trips. My five year old belly laughs at John's jokes! His favorite is of course the Ewok impression. I don't mind any repeat of material since I can listen to him over and over. Aside from that not all of them have all the same stuff so you get a little different and alot the same, but it is all funny and we love it! Now our friends and family are ordering him. It is hard to find a funny comedian that the whole family can enjoy and John Pinette is that comedian. The funniest comedian I have ever seen.  Saw him in person and he is absolutely genuine.  He came out after the show to meet myself and 20 of my best friends.  He even stayed for pictures.  I couldn't wait for this DVD.  I even order the CD so that I can listen to it while I'm in the car.  He focuses on making fun of himself, not others. great cd! great comedian! all his fans will miss him a lot. he had a way of taking the simplest things in life and helping you find the humor in them. guys who can make fun of themselves and not take life so seriously are the best! he never turned to crude or crass humor. John Pinette: I'm Starvin'!John Pinette - I Say Nay NayMaking Lite of MyselfWhen you can't watch the DVD, pop in the CD to listen to the audio of his I Say Nay Nay track.. can't help laughin' out loud!! Needs to record more! John Pinnette is funny. I don't know why it took me so long to hear of him, but this man is talented. If you're having a rough patch in your week, listing to this man talk abt food, shopping trips, and especially his legendary hatred of waiting in lines, and he'll have you back to smiling in no time!!! Super funny guy, the cd has a lot of re-done material, but weaves in some new items....I just really like this guy.  He is very talented and I have seen him in person....if you get the chance, do that!Dean This contains many of the routines listeners of XM and Sirius radio have enjoyed on their comedy stations. When you are stuck in traffic it will give you great tension relief. The world lost a brilliant comedian in April,...with the sudden death of John Pinette.  His CD,..&#34;Making Lite of Myself&#34; is a must have for any of his fans.  It is classic John Pinette entertainment,......one laugh after another.  As many times as I have listened to his comedy,...it always makes me laugh.Miss you John,.....hope the buffet in heaven has no lines...... I am a big fan of John Pinette, but I am very disappointed in John for releasing this ""new album"", which is just the audio track from his ""I Say Nay Nay"" DVD.  This is not a new album.  There is no new material here.  Again, it's just the audio from his most recent DVD. I saw HOMETOWN John at the Malden Catholic Homecoming and he was awesome  Took me back quite a few years as we grew up in the same city of Malden Ma  I have all his videos and cd's and love each one of them  Thanks for the laughs John  We laugh  at ourselves and with each other every time you speak I took my wife to see John, he's the only comedian she likes. Not because of his fat jokes but because he's really funny. He rarely uses profanity and his joke construction is on par with the best in the business. If you are a true fan of comedy and comedians you'll be able to tell the difference between a fat comedian who tells jokes and John who works on his material and changes it up until the final construction is perfected then he records that typically. He does change up the jokes at times pulling unnecessary pieces out but the basic concept is still intact. He's no George Carlin when it comes to volume of work and overall joke construction but look at some of George's early work and it's not too different from John's. A lot of repetion but that is what people want to hear from him. When you go to see Carlin you expect a different show with the occassional old routine thrown in for good measure. When you go to see John you go for the same reason you go to a music concert to hear the things you like. I've bought this CD even though I already own DVD's which contain the same material because I love listening to John in the car on trips. It's relaxing and is a great way to start a vacation. John Pinette is one of my new favorite comedians.  His humor is very broad based (no pun intended), and can be enjoyed by a wide audience. John Pinette is a rare breed of comic. He uses REAL humor without using filthy language. He is a true comic, and you will want to purchase this cd. He is as funny as ever. We'll certainly miss him. John Pinnette is so funny.  It does not matter if I hear him on CD, see him on DVD or live - he is the best. John Pinette's ""Making Lite of Myself"" is almost as funny as his ""Show me the Buffet"". I listen to one or the other while I am driving and I can assure you that if more people would do the same we would have a lot less road rage. They are both hysterically funny. Love his style of humor. Good clean & very funny. I don't suggest listening the first time while driving, you'll be laughing so hard you may not be able too see where you are going.  After the first time you will have better control.  You will definitely enjoy this routine! John Pinette is one of the funniest and classiest comedians out there these days.  I love his old stuff for years....its time for some new routines.  I know you have them in you! Downloaded this for my iPod.  John is one of the funniest commedians, and this is one of his best CDs. This is one of the first comedy CD's that is funny all the way through the end. John Pinette had me laughing so much,I was crying. People were staring at me on the freeway wondering what was going on. John uses no profanity nor does he tear down anyone but of course himself. I've been passing this CD on to my family and friends and they love it too! Unfortunately,Making Lite of Myselfis just a repeat of the material on his other cd's. It is funny, but if you buy one, I do not recommend buying another of his cd's or dvd's. Makes fun of him self and is very funny. This is a great comedy album. The language is questionable but is a very funny album. A must for a comedy collection I'm a fan of John and only recently got around to purchasing this CD. I took it on a road trip with some friends and we almost had to turn it off, we were laughing so hard at some of the bits that I worried the driver might have an accident. This material is typical Pinette, well done, with relatively little salty language and honest, self-deprecating humor that appeals to everyone,old and young alike. Do yourself a favor, and buy this CD! Since ""discovering"" John Pinette a few years ago on an HBO special, I have loved his humor; which is at times self depracating, observant of the world and always a downright crackup! I take John's CD's with me on trips in my car and they make long drives a real pleasure because they keep me laughing so much!Steve MarquezAntioch, TN This is the latest John Pinette CD and it is quite funny indeed.  However, if you have his DVD, just know that about 85% of the material is the SAME as what you can see on the DVD.  I like Pinette and his material, but feel this CD recycles way too much previously-issued material.  Where's the new beef, John? Any time you see something with John Pinette, you cannot go wrong.  He is an incredibly gifted comedian.  I bought this the day it was released, and have listened to it many many times, it never gets dull. John Pinette will make you cry, and possible pee!  Be prepared to laugh your behind off!

3,6,3937406328,"The purchase of this set was a bold step for me. I don't own any ""boxed"" sets. When I learned of this project on Chris's website I knew that this would be unique. I couldn't wait to explore such an immense piece of art. I'm still exploring. It's breadth is impressive. While I have my favorites there is not a song that is sloppy or rushed. Check back with me and my list of favorites will undoubtedly change. Currently it includes: Blind Willie (Texas Blues disc), My Blue World Says Hello (Electric Memphis Blues disc). As for the DVD... fascinating! I love the creative process that goes into any work of art. This is a little window into Chris's world and the musicians he worked with.The only downside to this project is that the book which houses the discs and the artwork is poorly designed to hold discs. They fall out very easily. All things considered, it's a minor inconvenience. All the music is now copied onto my computer/IPod.I Consider this purchase an investment in my education. Well worth the price. Chris Rea has been with us for a long time, and I am sure some of us out here still do not know his music.  If you like blues he is your man.  This set takes you on a journey from the grit heart of the blues, and shows a development and performance structure.  He is quite the music man. Wich popmusician would have the idiot idea to bring out 11 albums and a dvd, with brand new music on them? Why would anybody bother to listen to that much music of one artist? A lot of cd's are boring within 60 minutes, and there's so much more good music being made on this planet.Chris Rea obviously had that idiot idea, and he had some thoughts about the blues too. A fatal and selfoverating combination, I would expect. Chris Rea has made some albums in the past that were a bit boring. But the high level of his music on The Blue Jukebox, made me think that this man was doing something right. Could this album be any good?I knew Rea is a pretty good guitar player, who plays a mean slide. I already liked his voice. I liked the good popmusic on for instance Shamrock Diaries. But is anybody capable of filling that many cd's with blues, with his own personal style and voice without falling into an irritating form of narcism?I also had my doubts about the originality of an album with all these different styles of blues, done so many times before.For the reasons that no one in pophistory had pulled this off  before, my strong believe in the power of the blues and pure fascination for someone's intension to do such an outrageous project, I decided to buy the box.And, by the allmighty Thor, towering high above us, this music is allright. This band is tight. This man can play.Each album has a period or region in the blues as a starting point. What Rea does not do is take the blues in a riged way, but he does things with it. Sometimes he very much sticks to the original blues of that period, but you can also hear a popblues-variation very similar to older music of Chris Rea. Always played with the instruments of the period or region of the cd.The music sounds pretty relaxed, but is also very tight. Altough most of the work may have been done by Rea himself, the reason why the album sounds good has everything to do with the band. Essence of the blues naturally is the rhythm. A lot of blues done by popmusicians don't really sound like blues, tough the right chords etc. are used. But a real bluesband always has something more to offer. His band is a real bluesband and Chris Rea has become what every older musician should become: a bluesman. He proves it with 11 cd's full of blues! This kind of arrogance has to be rewarded.FJB/O!-music 2006 Why Chris Rea has never toured the States is a mystery. I can't find the words that could possibly pay justice to this man. He has an amazing voice, plays a mean guitar, composes great songs and yet is unknown in this country. I just don't get it. But for those who want to see what England has somehow managed to hide all this time (an undiscovered gem), check any one of his albums out. You'll soon be asking the same question. As a blues lover, I accidentally discovered Chris Rea on a compilation blues album that included '90's Blues' that gained my attention. Having listened to some of his other output, my feeling was that he was an artist who had some feeling for the blues. On an internet crawl last year I discovered the `Blue Guitars' album and after reading the reviews had to buy a copy. This is an incredible undertaking: 128 songs on 11 Cds based on the history of the blues. Each CD features one historical and geographical environment. The album comes in a hard cover book (unfortunately the CDs tend to fall out), that includes an interview with Chris Rea, paintings by Chris, a description of each album's basis, lyrics and includes a history of blues instruments used. Also included is a DVD detailing the production of an earlier CD, `Dancing down the road'.The first album, `Beginnings' blew me away. The album gives you a feel for the misery and despair suffered by people captured and transported. In addition it highlights the hope that the slaves envisioned via religion and the misunderstanding of their situation. The album is especially inspired as a result of the use of African instruments. This CD alone made the album worthwhile providing brilliant blues playing and incredible blues lyrics.The second album, `Country Blues' does not general reach quite the same heights. However, it is still superb, particularly `KK Blues'.Unfortunately the other 9 Cds do not reach the same level. Each CD has some high points and some sparkling moments, but never reach the same high point that the `Beginnings' album reaches. Many of the CDs provide a musical style, while probably accurate, does not appeal to my music tastes.In general, each subsequent album gets slowly poorer. The biggest disappointment is the last album `60s & 70s'. I grew up in this era and discovered the blues. Unfortunately, this CD offers blues that I do not identify with. It's too bad for all of us that it took a grave illness for Chris Rea to work on his most ambitious projects of his life.  This set alone would be a career for most artists.  Eleven differently themed music discs and a DVD documentary on the 12th disc!  Rea takes a genre such as Chicago Blues and imagines himself in that place and time and writes original material reminiscent of that genre.  And he pulls it off eleven times!  The set comes housed in a beutiful hard-bound book laced with reproductions of his own paintings.  You think the guy could spread some of his talent around!  It is one of the best bargains for the money to be found anywhere by anybody!  Buy it...it may not be around forever! I only own copies of this series of CDs, and am now going to buy the originals. One of my kids bought them, copied them and sent them to me and I have been hooked on them ever since. This is the most incredible feat anyone extant has achieved in music. I was absolutely floored when I received these CDs, a whole history of blues from that  execration known as slavery to modern times. Every single CD in this group is tremendous. If you love blues, look no further, it is all here. From Chicago to the Mississipi to Texas, from fifties break-out rock to blues ballads and even Celtic blues. What Chris Rea has done is in a word: amazing. Or in more words, it is gob-smacking and mind boggling. And, it's all good. The music is good, the lyrics are good, everything is impeccably done. And, of course, there is that smokey gritty voice which was made for this kind of music.  I've been a so-so fan of Chris Rea for many years. That is, I wasn't the kinda gung ho fan I am of Neil Young and Mark Knopfler, but this achievement of Chris Rea's really shows his immense talent and domination over his music and instruments. After having listened to this, one cannot help but think...what's he gonna do next? How is gonna top this? (And then some no-talent rapper gets the Grammy. Or the Oscar. And the real talent bites the dust. And so it goes. ) The music contained in this huge set of Cd's is truly amazing - in quality and breadth of styles included.I was already a Chris Rea fan but this work pushes into areas that commercial single CD's tend to avoid. He does this without the work being too heavy - it therefore would be appropriate as a first buy of Chris Rea and also for someone who was not that much into the blues.Truly enjoyable - and the book and paintings is an added huge bonus! This music is a delight to listen to.I know in time I will have my favourite tracks but in the meantime, just listening is pure pleasure. Some wonderful guitar music and plus the voice of Chris Rea makes this a must for any Collection. The presentation of the Collection is impresive, showing that Chris along with been a great Musician is a great artist.Chris Rea, thank you very much. I find this music to be very enjoyable.  This is the most I have paid for any group of music.  Chris Raye's music is blues but not is the strictest sense of the blues.  Another CD by Chris Rea is Highway to Hell.  This was my first experience listening to him. Also very enjoyable. I find that I listen to at least one of these CDs every day. Well worth the money. As a Chris Rea Fan I was excited when I ordered the 11 CD ""Blue Guitars"". When I listened to some of the earlier Blues era struff I couldn't believe they had gone and added fake record scratches and pops. Why oh Why ? For me, instead of lending some authenticity to the to these cuts, this engineering bit sort of cheapened them. Love every bit of this collection. Chris Rea has the perfect voice for the genre of slide guitar. I've split it into 'chill','easy listening' and 'upbeat' and just select the sub genre that suits my mood. Haven't stopped playing it most of the time and even my wife is right into it, after questioning why I wanted to spend the money! Chris Rea is a musician's musician - in other words, musicians recognize him for much more than a few hit songs and a tasty slide guitar. He has the heart of an artist and something even more important - INTEGRITY. I have just received ""Blue Guitars"" and have barely had time to listen to but a few tracks. I began by watching the DVD which only whetted my appetite to immerse myself, over time, in the whole project. What is immediately apparent is that Rea has not shirked his responsibility to be true to his own musical vision and also to the expectation of his fans who have come to expect exemplarary musicianship as well as audio excellence. A sample if somewhat cursory listening has confirmed my suspicions. ""Blue Guitars"" is a work of mammoth proportions and emotional depth. I fully intend to update this review over time as I am sure this is a journey that is going to take a while. I must admit I was a bit apprehensive when I heard that Chris Rea was to issue an 11 CD set.  I did not see how anyone could undertake such a huge project and hope that it would be up to his usual standard.  I really need not have feared.  Since receiving my copy of Blue Guitars at the beginning of the week I have listened to all 11 discs and have yet to find a bad one.  All the CD's are named for a particular type of blues and I have to say that they are all to a greater or lesser degree evocative of the genre they are named for.If this set had been issued by somebody new to the music scene, then all the usual pundits would be lauding him.  For Chris Rea, it is his farewell and a very poignant farewell it is.  If he had never issued anything else, then this would stand as a brilliant body of work.  Taken together with all the albums issued over the last 25 years, then it is outstanding.If you have never really listened to Chris Rea, then this is an opportunity to discern why he has had a faithful following over the years and why we have all looked forward eagerly to each new release.Thanks for the music Chris - we will not forget the pleasure you have given us and look forward to any releases with your new band Fireflies. This CD will test two things: Your love of the blues and your love of Chris Rea. If you're a lover of both, you'll recognize an artist who hit the height of his musical powers at the same time as he hit a near fatal low in his health.This CD is testimony to the power of being true to yourself and acknowledging your roots. Here is an artist who has refused to go on being ruled by the fickle criteria of commercial success and has had the courage to follow his heart. Chris Rea is willing to let his audience make up their own minds about this body of work. Anyone who loves the blues will love this CD. Anyone who acknowledges Chris Rea as one of the most important musical artists of his generation will be eternally grateful that he returned to the music that feeds his soul.Go beyond what's expected of you as a music consumer and confound the pundits - buy this brilliant collection of songs (they're not just blues numbers, they're beautifully written songs) and rejoice in an artist who found a way to be true to himself. I listen the entire new album of Chris Rea. I never hear a Chris Rea album before. This is an excepcional, complex & mesmerize album. This is the best album of this new century & one of the best blues album of all time. Eleven albums in one year !!! This is incredible. You must listen to it to believe it. The latin blues by English man sounds superior to the latin blues make for sud americans & spanish people. All the albums are great & sounds very very diferent. My favorites are: 60's & 70's, Chicago Blues,Electric Memphis Blues, Latin Blues & Ballads Blues. I recomend very much. Chris Rea is a favorite of mine and I have waited a long time to get this set and I love it.  It arrived promptly and in excellent condition, thank you... It is a fantastic collection of Chris Rea interpretation of the different Blues.I love Chris voice and his daring lyrics. With this collection Rea moved way up in the world of meaningful songs and music. BRAVO CHRIS Not a die hard Chris Rea fan (Sorry Mr Rea)Absolutely love this collection - I need a timber house beside a lake - Autumn perhaps, a little light rain and a warm Burbon or coffee. Conversation with a new love and a couple of close friends to make it complete. When I close my eyes listening to this collection that's what it evokes for me.Thank you Mr Rea for making us all feel like we've accomplished nothing with our lives : )If you love blues buy it. If you love Chris Rea buy it (you will any way)If you like Obnoxious Rap music buy it - You deserve what you get anyway. The idea is great - a journey through the history of blues and an attempt to recreate the feel of each style and time period. This is not an academic study, but it's Rea's interpretation. Fair enough, but the problem is that there are too many songs and Chris Rea doesn't have enough musical ideas to make each CD sound different enough from each other. Furhtermore, it sounds too Chris Rea. His signature slide playing and licks are featured throughout, his typical guitar sound too, so the experience ends up feeling like Road to Hell blues version 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Furthermore, delta blues, for instance, just doesn't sound right with Rea's British accent. Some of the songs are also pure pop songs and do not fit at all on a blues record. He even uses cheesy electric drums on some tracks.To make it sound more genuine, he should have copied the playing style typical for each style to a greater extent. He should have done what Ry Cooder did on his latest album, ""Pull Up Some Dust And Sit Down"", where he on one song mimics John Lee Hooker in singing and playing style, which works superbly well.Granted, each CD has its great points, and I think this release could have been much better if the project had been reduced to 2 or 3 CDs with only the best songs. howdy y'all,a really good - REALLY, REALLY good - overview and set of songs. my only complaint here is with amazon, not the boxed set. where is the list of disks & the tracks on them? here's one listing ...[...]take care,lee I didn't actually realise that this set came as a fairly sizeable book (duh!). Blue Guitars is a labour of love, and it shows. Rarely, if at all, have I known an artist to produce 11cd's of great songs. It's an interesting journey. The book, with it's paintings and an in -depth interview with Chris Rea, are almost a throwback to the old vinyl days of studying the album sleeve as you listen to the music. Rea's slide playing has never sounded better and his dark brown 'trombone ' of a voice carries you through the journey from the source of the blues through slavery, into the various manifestations of it up to the '60-70s. Great stuff.A minor point - The CD sleeves in the book are VERY FRAGILE so will not stand up to too much use. What a fine piece of music work done by Chris Rea! I was lucky enough to find this great collection of blues in Amazon.com, and for a marvelous price. I love all of the new songs Chris Rea introduces in this magnificent collection. Great music, every CD was worth it. It is amazing that someone could make an album comprising 11 CDs, truly creative. Must add the packing was very good and seller had taken absolute care and the album reached me in good time. Seller recommended. After my review of ""The Very Best of Chris Rea"", I received this 11-cd set. The reviews gave me confidence in my purchase. I have to say that not only does Chris Rea successfully separate the Blues of various areas, he continues to surprise me. I keep asking myself if he has ever made any musical duds. My favorite discs would be the 60's & 70's; Chicago Blues; Memphis Blues; but, and this may seem strange to the rest of you, but the absolute highlight for me is the DVD documentary that runs 70 mins. It is well made and entertaining while providing a rare insight into what an artist goes through to have his music heard. This in and of itself made the entire purchase worthwhile. The music is excellent and there are real gems throughout the collection. I just ordered 3 more Chris Rea cds; Thanks, Chris for all you do!","Europe,World Music,Blues Rock,Rock,Pop,Dance & Electronic,Britain,Singer-Songwriters,Rock Guitarists,Album-Oriented Rock (AOR),Dance Pop,Blues,British Isles,Folk,Classic Rock",purchase set bold step dont boxed sets learned project chriss website knew would unique couldnt wait explore immense piece art im still exploring breadth impressive favorites sloppy rushed check back list favorites undoubtedly change currently includes blind willie texas blues disc blue world says hello electric memphis blues disc dvd fascinating love creative process goes work art little window chriss world musicians worked downside project book houses discs artwork poorly designed hold discs fall easily things considered minor inconvenience copied onto computer ipod consider purchase investment education well worth price chris rea purchase set bold step boxed boxed sets sets learned project website knew unique wait explore immense piece art exploring breadth impressive favorites sloppy rushed check list favorites undoubtedly change currently includes blind willie texas texas blues blues disc blue blue world world says electric memphis blues blues disc dvd fascinating love creative creative process process work art little window window world world musicians musicians worked downside project book houses discs artwork poorly designed hold discs fall easily things considered minor inconvenience copied computer ipod consider purchase investment education worth price chris chris rea rea

7,17,5557894675,"Before there were British record charts, and before I was even born, Perry Como already had plenty of American charts. The most recent of the 23 featured here (If, not to be confused with the identically titled song by Bread) started and ended its chart run while I was in my mother's womb. Some of these songs may have made the British sheet music charts, but even if they did, it might not be because of Perry's recording. For example, Perry had a huge hit with Far away places (featured here), but he faced stiff competition. Three other versions charted, with Bing Crosby's version spending three weeks at #2 during its chart run, while Margaret Whiting's version also peaked at #2, but spent six weeks there, while Perry's version peaked at #4. I like all three, but I like Margaret's version best.Despite being released on a budget label, this compilation not only includes liner notes but also peak chart positions. More importantly, it contains a fine selection of Perry's early hits. During the period covered, Perry has eight #1 hits in America, and six of them are included here, occupying the first six places on the CD. The omissions are Surrender (which Woody Herman also took into the top ten) and Chi-baba Chi-baba (which Peggy Lee also took into the top ten), but they are not difficult to find elsewhere. The remaining tracks are not in any obvious order, and are certainly not based on chart dates or peak positions.While by no means comprehensive, this compilation offers an excellent selection of hits from the early part of Perry Como's career.Tracks1.

Now this is an album for hard rockers and 80s nostolgia addicts who like harder rock.  Guns and Roses has been my favorite band since i was 7 years old and certain songs scream Guns and Roses to me these would be fall to pieces (reminds me of paradise city/sweet child of mine off Appetite for Destruction)Sucker train blues (listen to the scream near the end if the rest of the song doesnt scream Gn'R to you)and Slither the guitar playing sounds distinctly reminiscent of Guns and Roses.  The Other songs on the cd have some clear Guns Roses influences as well but they are usually not the dominant thing in the songs that would be Scott Weiland in my opinion.  I think that Scott was already trying to lead Stone Temple Pilots in a similiar direction Velvet Revolver takes on this cd based on listening to the bonus track on Thank You (stp's greatest hits) thats just my opinion though listen to it and decide for yourself if it does or doesnt sound like he was leaning that direction before he even joined VR(all in the suit that you wear).I would have to recommend this to Guns Roses Fans its the only thing i ever heard by any band that has a similiar feel to Appetite for destruction in anyway shape or form.  Stone Temple Pilots chose different sounds for all of their cds so STP fans may also want to check this one out if nothing else great for your collection if your a big fan of either band.This is a great hard rock cd even if you don't like their previous bands.  This release has 4 top 20 hits and is their best cd in the opinion of most fans those hits are:Slither, Fall to Pieces,Dirty little thing,Set me Free.

14,29,B0000000AY,"As far as this albumn goes the music is very relaxing and soothing. It is music that can be listened to, to drift off to sleep with. The only problem with the album is my own expectation of what it would be. I imagined maybe a little more pan pipe style of music, rain and thunder type of atmospheric ambience, rather than the tweetie birds and animal sounds.Music is a very subjective thing, so if you want true rainforest type of music this album is for you. This CD, which I play every other day, immediately immerses me in a world that Terry Oldfield has so artfully created, a world that is at once raw and elemental, and at the same time whole and poignant. As I allow the lead instrumentation to be the focus of my own being, it leads me through a day of a youth living with a small tribe surrounded by the rainforest. I am embraced both by the awesome powers of nature all around and the raw joy of being with others in a river of life, while the distracting power of my mind settles in its coop like one of the pets of the tribe. I love the sound of the rain forest! I just Love the great sounds of the music while you listen to the wildlife in the background, its a great CD to listen to, when you want to relax and enjoy the beuatiful sounds. I hope  you will like this as I did. I actually had this on cassette for many years and always found it very soothing. Thrilled to find it on CD, it's just as great as I remember. I LOVE Spirit of the Rainforest and have recommended it to all my friends. I have listened to this CD over 200 times in the past year, it is great while working in the garden, or background music for any occasion. I also listen to it as a Sunday morning relaxant-wake up call. It is not sleep inducing to me, I feel it generates my soul and makes me uplifted.  This is an absolute must have CD for anyone who likes dreaming of being in the Rain Forest - This CD has a lot of class! We begin our journey through tropical forest. We walk on a narrow path. The crowns of majestic trees are over our heads and the ancient forest is around us. We observe a tumult of most amazing colors. The trees are rustling with a rich green leaves. Mysterious forest sounds are reaching us. And, somewhere far away, we hear a soft singing - this is a singing of an Indian flute. And we go to that place, where this calm and peaceful music plays...This is how I'd like to tell you about the album ""Spirit Of The Rainforest"" by Terry Oldfield, because this is a music of beauty and harmony. Moreover, it contains a deep perception of the surrounding world as it really is. Meditative flute of Terry Oldfield carries a voice of pure and naked pristine world to the listener. Multiple nature sounds, used by the musician not only create an original background, immersing us into the very heart of tropical forest, but introduce a wilderness of living nature in the sounding of the album. Noise of the wind, rustling of the trees, calling voices of wonderful birds - all this is a natural music of the Nature itself. And Terry Oldfield gives her opportunity to express herself, only slightly mastering this music, which comes as it seems from the very depths of Mother-Earth, by fine intelligent artistic touches and uniting all this into a whole.The album consists of two approximately equal parts. In the first one, ""Between Two Words"", we are tuning to the rainforest and entering its secret halls. In the second one, named ""The Listening Heaven"", we are in the very heart of the forest, and its Spirit is talking to us. The hidden power and energy of the Spirit is displayed in the music. I'd like to mention one more characteristic feature of the music: Terry Oldfield has very successfully used Indian melodies, which are an organic part of his music.And now I'd like to tell you a very important thing. Maybe someone, who is  reading  these lines, having looked at the data of release of this album, would say: ""Ha! Is it really a new album?!"" Yes, it is really so. ""Spirit Of The Rainforest"" was recorded almost ten years ago. Still this music sounds very freshly. The matter is, that Terry Oldfield has anticipated the time. In the last years a lot of music appeared, where melodies and living instruments of South-American Indians is used, and where various sounds of tropical forest serve as a background. For example, a famous American company Earthone Records has released many albums with the music of this kind. And this is not the last example. Still, Terry Oldfield made it in 1990! He is the Pioneer, who was followed by the other musicians. And as I consider, in many respect thanks to Terry Oldfield this music is very popular now. Listen to ""Spirit Of The Rainforest"" and convince yourself that this is really so!Serge Kozlovsky[...]","New Age,Meditation,Jazz,World Music",far albumn goes relaxing soothing listened drift sleep problem expectation would imagined maybe little pan pipe style rain thunder type atmospheric ambience rather tweetie birds animal sounds subjective thing want true rainforest type cd play every day immediately immerses world terry oldfield artfully created world raw elemental time whole poignant allow lead instrumentation focus leads day youth living small tribe surrounded rainforest embraced awesome powers nature around raw joy others river life distracting power mind settles coop like one far relaxing soothing listened drift sleep problem expectation imagined maybe pan pan pipe pipe style rain thunder type atmospheric ambience birds animal sounds subjective want true rainforest type cd play day immediately immerses world terry terry oldfield oldfield artfully created world raw elemental time poignant allow lead instrumentation focus leads day youth living tribe surrounded rainforest embraced awesome powers nature raw joy river life distracting power mind settles coop

16,31,B0000000HB,"It is great music, very spanish, arabic, the guitar playing is superb. Strunz and Farrah are the masters of guitar. My quest for quality acoustic guitar music continues with &quot;Heat of the Sun&quot;. It was &quot;Guitar Greats - Best of New Flamenco&quot; on Baja/TSR that got me started on acoustic guitar music. (my guitar CD collection now includes; Armik, Jesse Cook, Oscar Lopez, Ottmar Liebert, NovaMenco)This is my first Strunz &amp; Farah CD. I rate &quot;Heat of the Sun&quot; very highly indeed. Max. stars. Program content is excellent. plenty of variety from fast gorgeous numbers to slow sexy ones. The mix from the other instrumentalists adds real musical value to the total package. Well done! The sound quality of this CD is excellent as well.All tracks in this CD are 5-star material, but my favorites got to be; Dark Fire; Jardin; and Recuerdo.Great CD. Highly recommended. Strunz and Farah have been around for a few years and their mastery of the acoustic guitar is very impressive. You can sense that they love what they do, it comes across. Highly recommended. WOW! This Album Is Really A Jewel . It Contains An Extenxive Variety Of Latin Rythms And Scale Paterns Creating A Precious Mix Of The Two Roots Of  The Spanish Giutar. Great mood music and motivational sounds.  Keeps my spirits up and enjoying the days and nights.What a great and wonderful sound they accomplish. S&amp;F go all out on this one to produce an awesome display of their incredible guitar skills matched with perfect percussionists abilities.  Definitely one of the crown jewels of guitar CDs and even one of S&amp;F's  best! this is their all tiem best CD.a must have for guitarists into jazz fusion, spanish, latin, world, eastern, arabic influences My first taste of the music of Strunz and Farah came roughly 15 years ago when I heard them on Austin's independent radio station KGSR. The DJ did not mention who they were, so I pulled off the road, called the station and got the name of the group and the album (Primal Magic). I liked what I heard so much that I detoured over to Waterloo Records and bought it on cassette.Since that time, I have enjoyed many other Strunz and Farah recordings and have yet to hear a bad one.Their earliest work while they were still in the process of establishing their style is sometimes repetitious and somewhat mediocre, but most of what I've heard is in the four to five star category, so the problem becomes trying to sort out the best from the rest. And since there is a superficial sameness to a lot of their music, albeit on a very high plane, the sorting becomes difficult.Though I have not heard everything the duo has recorded, I've heard most of it. When Heat of the Sun was initially issued, availability was spotty perhaps because it was issued on a small independent label. I bought it on sight and when I put it in the CD player, it blew me away. Sometimes Strunz and Farah just play, and play very well, but on Heat of the Sun they play with a rare gusto that suggests syncronicity with their muse.I like the entire CD a lot and it stands tall after ten years as one of the best of its genre. My favorites are the sprightly Jardin, the smouldering Dark Fire, the virtuoso title cut, the languid Recuerdo, the mellow La Tinaja, and what I consider the CD's best song, the dreamy soundscape that is Terremoto.Its difficult to keep up with all the great music that comes out year after year, and especially difficult to keep up with a group as prolific as Strunz and Farah. So if you have just a couple of Strunz and Farah recordings in your collection, one of them should be Heat of the Sun, because it is definitely one of their best. I most highly recommend it. I had the CD before and I lost it.  But it was such a powerful CD that I ordered it again.  The music of Strunz & Farah just makes you move.... I usually purchase used CDs as I am just looking for the material; just bear in mind that the quality description may not always accurately describe the CDs condition. Sometimes I feel I got a great deal other times not. Easy food. Warm, soft, fat, sweet, sour, hearty. Easy to swallow, no tastebuds or chewing required. I will not say hamburgers cannot be good. But if you tasted the real food from other albums, to my taste this CD is utterly unsatisfying.Another reviewer wrote: ""Strunz and Farah's fusion of middle eastern sounds with flamenco, jazz, rock and latin elements reached its zenith on ""Frontera."" It went downhill from here, though very gradually."" While there are real gems to be found on almost each CD (I own them all), in general I fully agree with him. The big 'M' vs SlowFood... Strunz and Farah are amazing artists.  This album showcases their talent, and proves that they are the best in the business.  Do not hesitate to purchase Heat of the Sun, or Americas which I also have and can recommend. Fantastic music!  I fell in love with this combination of Spanish & Middle Eastern acoustic guitar when I strolled into a beautiful shop in LaJolla, CA... I asked right away WHAT is this music? I bought the CD ten years ago and listen to it almost EVERY DAY! It is soothing, invigorating, lively music full of lovely melodies I can't get enough of. I have since purchased other CDs by this duo (e.g., The Americas), but prefer the ""Heat of the Sun"" over the others. Enjoy. This is outstanding nuevo flamenco! It's pure magic. Strunz & Farah are just plain masters of the genre. Love it love it love it! I bought over a dozen CD's from Amazon and immediately loaded them on my iPod and have been playing them often.

17,33,B0000000HF,"Hello ... how are you? Great, me too; and you .. and the family, the children ... All is well thanks. Here is the review: Needs to improve communications; otherwise, good deal, CD in good shape and received promptly. Thanks .. still...! I like to rate albums after the fact, in most cases.  I remember being impressed by the artists' virtuosity on the guitar.  That's all I remember.  The recording style and instrumentation has a '70's feel to it.  Some  might not care, I do.  After all, the album is from 1982.  The result is  that you'll listen all the way through the first time.  Then, when the  novelty wears off, you'll file it in your spare CD case and forget about  it.  If you're just checking out this style of music, this album might not  be the one for you. For the steel string guitar afficionados, this album is heaven. It doesn't get any better than this. The melodic invention of the arabesques they weave throughout this album is unprecedented.Ever since I've heard L.Subramaniam play on this CD, I've been searching for his other recordings, but nothing he did since this session comes even close to the intensity displayed here. Strunz&amp;Farah's 1st recording from 1980 sounds better now than ever before. Although different in many ways (rhythms, still string guitars, compositions style) to their more popular rumba albums of the '90, Mosaico  is an outstanding album of true world fusion. Guest artist L.Subramaniam  plays one of the most haunting violin solos ever on &quot;Shadow of  Heaven&quot; and S&amp;F define new limits for pick style acoustic guitar  players with their outstanding Before I stumbled across a set of Strunz & Farah with their band on KVIE TV, I didn't know that this kind of music existed. I primarily listen to hardcore and death metal, so when I heard and saw them play as quick, precise, and as beautifully as they did (on acoustic guitars, which inherently slows down the ability to play fast), I was blown away.I couldn't find any of their CDs in any record stores, so I eventually came on here and got this, their first and cheapest CD. It's been a few weeks, and haven't stopped listening since! Although long since Yuppified, co-opted, and infected by the all-pervasive, nauseating, 'Gipsy Kings Virus' permeating most guitar music  classified as &quot;World,&quot; Strunz and Farah were, once upon a time, a  magnificent group.Their uncompromosing early  records--&quot;Mosaico,&quot; &quot;Frontera,&quot; and  &quot;Guitarras&quot;--were one-of-a-kind fusions of middle-eastern and  latin acoustic guitar styles mixed with scorching doses of electrifying  improvisation. These three records will always remain near the top of my  list of Acoustic Fusion Classics (right up there with Shakti and Paco De  Lucia Sextet).Of special note on &quot;Mosaico,&quot; of course, is the  guest appearance of East-Indian Violin wizard L.Subramaniam. The two tunes  on which he displays his awesome virtuosity (and inspires Strunz and Farah  to similar heights of their own) sound like the greatest Mahavishnu  Orchestra tracks Mahavishnu never recorded. Just electrifying stuff. The  rest of the record is a wonderfully varied, highly melodic, deeply rooted  TOUR DE FORCE of Latin style acoustic guitar which refuses to pander to the  superficial tastes of the very would-be cretins who would later come to  make them popular 'World Music' favorites.","Jazz Fusion,Jazz,Pop,Latin Music,World Music,Flamenco",hello great family children well thanks review needs improve communications otherwise good deal cd good shape received promptly thanks still like rate fact cases remember impressed artists virtuosity guitar thats remember recording style instrumentation feel might care result youll listen way first time novelty wears youll file spare cd case forget youre checking style might one steel string guitar afficionados heaven doesnt get better melodic invention arabesques weave throughout unprecedented ever since ive heard l subramaniam play cd ive searching recordings nothing hello great family children thanks review needs improve communications good good deal deal cd good good shape shape received promptly thanks rate fact cases remember impressed artists virtuosity guitar remember recording style instrumentation feel care result listen way time novelty wears file spare cd cd case case forget youre checking style steel steel string guitar string guitar heaven get better better melodic invention arabesques weave unprecedented ever since heard play cd searching recordings
18,34,B0000000I6,"This was Patrick O' Hearns very first album. It came out in 1985, I wasn't even born then but my dad bought the album later in 1993 and I listen to it all the time. I loved every CD by Patrick O' Hearn the sounds he uses are so great that I could never listen to any of his songs just once.&quot;At First Light&quot; is a soft song and gets louder towards the end.&quot;Beauty in Darkness&quot; has a great beat to it and it mostly stays the same except for some other small sounds around it.&quot;Unusual Climate&quot; and&quot;Ancient Dreams&quot; are also excellent songs and are probably my two favorites on the album. Most of Patrick O' Hearns albums are all dark ones except El Dorado and Rivers Gonna Rise are more of daytime albums and I would recommend them because they are different. The only problem is that Rivers Gonna Rise is very hard to find in most places. I am still trying to find a place to get a new copy of it but it is available used at half.com.Buy all of Patrick O' Hearns music today he is an excellent musician! Never, ever is disappointing.....I have yet to hear any of his works which don't sooth and mesmerize at the same time! ""Ancient Dreams,"" released in 1985, is the first ""dark"" New Age album I ever acquired, and it's still one of my favorites--juicy, complex and predominantly electronic.  While filled with percussive textures, this is not mindlessly beat-driven club music; it's a fascinating, ever-changing and very intelligently crafted journey through mood and sound.  One of the things I love about it is how seamlessly and elegantly Patrick O'Hearn manages to combine apparent opposites--heat and chill, denseness and light, drama and funk.  It's truly a unique and deliciously striking brew of musical nuances--simultaneously relaxing and stimulating.  In the liner notes, commentator Freff writes ""Music wears a thousand masks, and exists for a million reasons.  It reaches our heads, hearts, and our bodies.  It can be gentle, pleading, angry, demanding, healing: as fierce as fire and as cold and dangerous as thin ice.  It is so many things because we are so many things, inside.  The most special music reflects our private selves.""  This is a perfect description of Patrick O'Hearn's keyboard and synth-driven compositions.  For more electronic explorations of the dark and mysterious, try also the work of Tangerine Dream, Enigma and Amethystium. I am astonished to just realize this was his first album. When you first get a Patrick album, the songs sound nice, but you don't love them immediately. You have to listen to each album every day for 2 weeks to fall  in love with a few of the songs. I would call the style &quot;Experimental  Jazz-based New Age.&quot; Similar to Tangerine Dream, but the sounds here  are not so exotic. The whole album is good; the title track is a  masterpiece -- it contains every facet that makes Patrick's music great: A  very clever experiment actually using a piano as a percussion instrument  (I've never heard ANYONE else do it!), the little heartbroken trumpets, and  his unique genius at playing the melodic line of a song super-slow. (Each  note lasting many measures.) The album would be worth it just for this  song, but the rest is good! Metaphor, Indigo, and Eldorado are my favorite  albums of his (in order). While this is not a new recording, and the big-hair insert picture certainly dates it, it was a very forward looking recording that came out in the 80's.  I remember this recording fondly, and still listen to it.  While the 80's electronics are ""dated"" by modern standards, they were cutting edge and popular at the time.This music is a bit more somber than others from this period, but some cuts easily slice into the space music genre, with the subtle rhythms carrying the listener along.  It is good music in the car or home, and definitely helped launch Private Music's label.  I may be just getting old, but miss the 80's cutting edge labels and their wonderful instrumental music. I share the same enthusiasm as my fellow reviewers here.  For a short period of time in the 80's we had New Age music. Which of course was a subjective category. It encompassed all sorts of kinds of musical styles ( usually instrumental).  Patrick O Hearn might have held the title as the best of this era.Wonderful soothing synthesizers with crashing, primitive percussions along with exotic flutes and other musical instruments from around the world tied together in a transfixing musical combination carrying the music along winding through your imagination.  Turn off the lights and let yourself experience this CD with your imagination. Even after all these years I find this CD better than ever. Time has not dated it. It sounds as fresh and introspective as ever. This is Patrick O'hearns first album. It came out WAAAAAYY back in 1985(I was just a toddler then). I first heard the title track and the dark disturbing masterpiece song Beauty In Darkness when I got his Private Music Collection in 1998 and O'hearn has since become one of my top ten all time favorite musicians.The music on here is rather dark, spacey, and electronic, contrast to his post Indigo material which I like as well.Give a listen to the haunting title track with those thundering drums combined with a spacey atmosphere, Beauty In Darkness with a dark almost like an approaching storm with. The opening track At First Light is a gorgeous song with haunting synthesizers combined with some tingling synths. I heard that the melodic structure of this song was sampled in a club hit ten years later with Robert Miles Children and Patrick was not too pleased. While I love children a lot, At First Light is a new age classic.My only complaint is that this CD is only 32 and a half minutes long but the incredible quality of this timeless masterpiece makes up for it. This album is a new age classic and all fans of Patrick O'hearn, both fans of his acoustic medievel mid 90s material as well electroheads like me should have this one in their collection.In fact every album by Mr. O;hearn is worth owning from this one all the way to his new album So Flows The Current. Not as good as Indigo or beautiful World but better than Between Two Worlds. extremely well structured album, perfectly rounded, not your typical cheesy new age!!! The texture of sounds and melodies are purely mesmerizing (malevolent landscape...), the recording, wich is fairly old, is truly state of the art... True passionates of textural music, don't miss that cd... Patrick O'Hearn's, &quot;Ancient Dreams,&quot; is truly a wonder!  This is such an extraordinary album that anyone who listens to new age music should not pass it up.  The musical atmosphere is strange &amp; mysterious, sparce yet rhythmic, evoking a sense of the deep and hidden passageways of dreams, ancient or contemporary.  The music is timeless. This is Patrick O'Hearn's first solo CD.  It comes from 1985.  It is only 32 minutes long.  The sound quality is excellent.This is one of those new age albums from the mid-eighties that took advantage of the new digital and CD technologies.  It has a great dynamic range and beautiful sonic quatity.Like most of the early new age work, this is all about the sonic qualities and making beautiful sounds.  It is not about the compositions.  Like many new age albums, this is just repeated sounds; very beautiful sounds; but no cohesive composition.  I find it to be repetitive and boring.There are some interesting parts to the CD, and track 6 is very good throughout.  This whole CD might be OK as background music.Patrick O'Hearn got his start with playing bass for Frank Zappa.  He was then in Group 87 with Mark Isham (who plays trumpet on this CD).  After that, he struck it big with Missing Persons, featuring 3 other musicians who used to play for Zappa. I remember first hearing ""At First Light"" literally at dawn as one well known New York jazz DJ had taken to start his morning program with this ethereal, powerful, provocative, darkly beautiful piece.  I... was.... mesmerized.  I promptly rushed to the record outlet and picked it up. I soon discovered that there was no let down throughout this recording. What that one piece promised that, and the remaining pieces delivered.  Patrick O'Hearn is one of the great undiscovered. For this type of music, he is one of the very best.  ""At First Light"", ""Unusual Climate"" , ""Live  Along the River Baal"" and ""Malevolent Landscape"" are true highpoints.  This is one to listen to from beginning to end. The pieces are different but flow together seamlessly.  This was strong and brilliant debut. This is mediocre new-age music. It sounds extremely dated, very much quantized, and just doesn't have a very good flow to it. I would call it fad new-age rather than calling it a masterwork with any worthwhile musicality.I don't find it bad. I listened to the whole album, and wouldn't mind if someone turned it on for background music, but with so much other really good work out there, I just wouldn't recommend spending your money on this. A wee bit o'history: In 1985, Ancient Dreams was one of the flagship releases by Patrick O'Hearn on what was then a relatively new recording label, Private Music, which was founded by a former member of the German electronic group Tangerine Dream.Patrick O'Hearn was also no stranger to the music industry when he signed on  with Private Music, having been a songwriter and (I believe) electric base guitarist with 80's new wavers Missing Persons. O'Hearn's ability to craft melodic lines for friendly fm pop radio with MP aided him especially well when Ancient Dreams was released, as it validated Mr. O'Hearn as an accomplished songsmith in his own rite, as well as give needed visibility to the Private Music label.What works for Ancient Dreams is that the melodies he was able to compose for pop-music translate so well to this ambient or electronic or 'New Age' format (I think the term used nowadays is 'Modern Instrumental Music'). Unlike many of his peers who were releasing similar-genre music at the time, but which could be hard to listen to and not very interesting due to it tendency to drone monotonously, Patrick O'Hearn was able to take his melodic songwriting skills and apply them to non-vocal, ambient sonic textures, with the result being a much more listen-able experience, which allows for repeated listens as more and more can be heard in the music each time, a hallmark of good music in any style.What does not work for Ancient Dreams is the 1980's production: big, dense, characterless percussion, dated and especially the clich`ed keyboard sounds, including synth brass, synth vocals and synth woodwinds. To some degree it is not fair to attack Ancient Dreams on this level, as Patrick O'Hearn was simply going with convention both technology and taste-wise at the time (To bolster my point, note the really, really, Really big 1980's poodle hair on a young Mr. O'Hearn on the original Private Music cd insert!) However, at the same time, it is the case that these sounds do really have a tendency to make the listener cringe, no matter how many times you hear them - this production sounded bad enough in retrospect when applied to pop / rock music of that era; it sounds horrible when used on such music as Ancient Dreams, as there are no vocals and the music is much more subtle than other genres, so the production 'cringe-factor' is even more obvious. This is a pity, as the music itself on Ancient Dreams still has a lot to say. But then again, more current collections by Mr. O'Hearn, such as on the excellent 'So Flows the Current' (2000) or more recent Glaciation (2007) also combine the austerity and subtle melodicism that Patrick is known for, but with instrumentation and production that will outlast the era in which they were made - perhaps Mr. O'Hearn himself cringes when he hears Ancient Dreams now, and took these thoughts to heart years ago when crafting his future albums, such as the ones I've just mentioned.If you are a Patrick O'Hearn fan, none of the above criticisms will probably change your mind about what a great composer and musician he is, and probably you will not subscribe to my critique of this album. However, if you are a new-comer to Patrick O'Hearn's music, my advice would be to start with a more recent collection, such as 'So Flows The Current', where you will be able to really appreciate Patrick's stunning songwriting in a more modern and lasting sonic setting. Patrick O'Hearn was one of the first &quot;New Age&quot; artists I discovered many moons ago. &quot;Ancient Dreams&quot; is still one of my all-time favorite albums of any genre. The moodiness struck a chord with me during a trying time in my life and it remains with me to this day. Putting this CD in the player takes me back to a time in my life when i needed an outlet for my darkness. And as a musician, I like to think I can see colors in sounds and this offering sends me all kinds of colors and textures. Even, at times, overwhelming me with it's landscapes - some of them alien, some of them from deep inside.Do yourself a favor and at least sample this disk. My only complaint is that it is only about 30 minutes long.","Adult Alternative,Progressive,Jazz,Pop,New Age,Rock,Meditation,Electronic",patrick hearns first came wasnt even born dad bought later listen time loved every cd patrick hearn sounds uses great could never listen quot first light quot soft gets louder towards end quot beauty darkness quot great beat mostly stays except small sounds around quot unusual climate quot quot ancient dreams quot also excellent probably two favorites patrick hearns dark ones except el dorado rivers gonna rise daytime would recommend different problem rivers gonna rise hard find places still trying find place get new copy available used half com buy patrick hearns today excellen came born dad bought later listen time loved cd sounds great listen quot light soft end quot beauty darkness quot great beat stays sounds quot unusual climate quot quot ancient dreams quot excellent probably favorites dark dark ones ones el el dorado dorado rivers rivers rise daytime recommend different problem rivers rise hard find places trying find place new copy available used half com buy today
19,35,B0000000IB,"This is one of Yanni's best albums! In my opinion,it's second only to Out Of Silence,which I think IS his BEST album.Since I,Ed am your guide to many New Age albums, I feel it's my responsibility to give you my personal opinion if I own the album.Anyway, this album is still pretty good with tracks like The North Shore Of Matsushima,Santorini,Keys To Imagination[the title track],and Forbidden Dreams, which are all my personal favorite tracks.However, the other tracks are still not bad.Overall,this album is so approprietly titled.It truly is a KEY TO IMAGINATION. If you like Yanni, synthesizers, and New Age music, this is definitely for you? Keys to Imagination is the best piece of modern music ever written (I only wish I gad written it instead on Yanni!). North Shore of Matsushima is a great way to start off a CD, conjuring up images of waves crashing on some distant coastline. With the exception of Forgotten Yesterdays, which seems to simply be a space-filler between Keys to Imagination and Forbidden Dream, these are some of the best pieces Yanni has ever written! BUY IT! I really enjoy this album. As a massage therapist I am always looking for good music to work by and Yanni is always good. My only complaint to this album would be that it is to short. I typically do 1 hour treatments and it is much shorter than that, but I burn it with some of his other stuff and it works fine.On a side note who ever did the cover art did a great job!!! Hi- like I said, I gave all my albums to Goodwill when I ""updated"" to CD, one of my only regrets in life. It's been a long wait to get this on CD, and I'm smiling as my force field is complete now. Item was received before the estimated ship date and arrived in excellent condition, exactly as described. The LP itself had no scratches and sounds excellent. Very recommended for anyone who loves Yanni! The same as Sanctuary - love it.  I'll buy used CDs so I can have one in my CD changer and another to use elsewhere. This was my first Yanni album and my first purchase in the New Age Genre. When I purchased it, I was imagining something quite different and therefore wasn't hooked. But as I lived with it, I found that this music is deep and poignant. Yanni created a sound on this album that he never reproduced. It it thoroughly New Age, much more developed and seamless than the sound of his previous album, and much less ""Pop"" than the sounds of his subsequent albums. I would consider this album one of his top three. The other two would be ""In My Time"" and ""Tribute."" In fact, these three albums represent the zenith of each of his three 'styles.' ""Keys to Imagination"" is excessively electronic and primarily extroverted. ""In My Time"" is very intimate and the music revovles around luscious piano melodies. ""Tribute"" marks the beginning of Yanni's decline, although it is a superb album. It is heavily orchestrated and members of Yanni's troupe are given leniency to improvise heavily on the tunes. Their artistry shines brighter than Yanni's melodies and rhythms at times. Yanni has never recovered his stature after his enormously successful concert at the Acropolis, which basically summed up his entire career up to that point. It is unfortunate for us that his career has taken a downturn. He could craft a melody as heartbreaking as Mozart could. beatiful  music to relax with or fall asleep to.  I've alwayes liked piano music  with an orchestra and Yanni is great.  Make sure you dont get the Yanni Voices as it has too much singing The CD is very relaxing to listen to and would recommend it if you are an avid Yani fan.  (Which I am) Of all Yanni's CD's I believe this is the one which may withstand the test of time far and above the rest.  (not to include ""Live At The Acropolis"" since I consider it to be a ""greatest hits"")  This is his only album that I still listen to on a regular basis.  There's just something about ""Keys"" which makes it the very best CD I have for the listening to in the car, or at work, etc.  I believe it's because the music is ambient, yet definitely lively enough to keep your attention.  Very classical, but synthesized.  And unlike most other new age music, the melodies are catchy enough to stick in your mind.  If you're a fan of instrumentals or synths, chances are you'll really go for this album! Yanni was his most intimate and touching with &quot;In My Time&quot; with its focus on the piano and softer, more lush melodies. With &quot;Keys to Imagination&quot;'s (6 years the senior of &quot;In My Time&quot;) focus on the synthesizers, you see Yanni at his most explosive and dynamic! The melodies are crisp and complex, the type that you just find yourself playing over and over again in your head. Each song is an adventure through.... well, the imagination! Tracks like the title track and &quot;Forbidden Dreams&quot; are passionately free spirited, and not to mention the first appearence of the Yanni classic &quot;Nostalgia&quot; which is jaw-droppingly amazing and powerful. Any Yanni experience should begin here. Yanni is so talented and self taught. His orchestra and band members are the best. His music will last forever.","Adult Alternative,Adult Contemporary,Progressive,Jazz,Pop,New Age,Rock,Meditation,Electronic",one yannis best opinion second silence think best since ed guide many new age feel responsibility give personal opinion anyway still pretty good like north shore matsushima santorini keys imagination title forbidden dreams personal favorite however still bad overall approprietly titled truly key imagination like yanni synthesizers new age definitely keys imagination best piece modern ever written wish gad written instead yanni north shore matsushima great way start cd conjuring images waves crashing distant coastline exception forgotten yesterdays seems simply space filler keys imagination forbidden dream one yannis best opinion second silence think best guide new age feel responsibility personal opinion pretty good shore matsushima santorini keys imagination title forbidden dreams personal favorite bad overall titled truly key imagination yanni synthesizers new age definitely keys imagination best piece modern written wish gad written instead yanni north shore matsushima great way start cd conjuring images waves crashing distant coastline exception forgotten yesterdays seems simply space filler keys imagination forbidden dream
20,36,B0000000IG,"Between Two Worlds is another great CD from Patrick O' Hearn. I noticed when I listened to the album that he uses many of the same sounds that he did in Ancient Dreams. I purchased the album off of amazon a while before knowing only the the song ""between two worlds"" and I loved listening to it. The very first time I heard Patrick O' Hearns music was on Indigo and I knew right then that I had to get more albums by him. I thought this was one of his best but probably Indigo is my favorite. Between Two Worlds would be an okay album to start off with but in my opinion Indigo or Ancient Dreams would be better.""Rain Maker"" is an excellent one he plays one tune and than adds other dark sounds around it.""Gentle was the Night"" is a soft and soothing song with great keyboard sounds. In ""Fire Ritual"" he uses a variety of voices along with more sounds.""87 dreams of a lifetime"" starts out soft and than comes in with drums. Then that takes us to the title track witch mostly has the same tune with some other little small instruments around it.All in all, between two worlds is excellent. I hope my review was helpful to any of you who would like to buy this album and I hope you all enjoy Patrick O' Hearns music. I bought this album quite awhile back, then somehow lost it in the interim of moving and relocating, etc.  I missed listening to it,so bought it again. As it was then, so it is now, a great listening composition of relaxing music.If you are a Patrick O'Hearn fan, this album will not disappoint. You can't miss with this CD.  O'Hearn is magical.  &quot;Forever the Optimist&quot; and &quot;87 Dreams of a Lifetime&quot; are two exceptional tracks. Listeners who enjoy this album should try &quot;The Private Music of Tangerine Dream.&quot; I would call Patrick O'Hearns style &quot;Experimental Jazz-based New Age.&quot; Similar to Tangerine Dream,  but the sounds here are not so exotic. The whole album is good; the track  &quot;Sky Juice&quot; is great, also &quot;Forever the Optimist,&quot; and  &quot;Journey to Yoruba.&quot; I ordered this used CD one afternoon, and received it in like-new condition the very next.  How can you beat that? This is an essential new age album that you should not pass up. This was Patrick O'hearns best album before his new album surpassed it. This is probably Patricks most space oriented of his electronic albums to date. It's the dark electronic, rainy music that makes me love this album. Every song on here is a breakthrough for this extremely talented musician. Some songs I remember hearing when I was very young.Rainmaker is a very haunting song with an intense misty atmosphere with some ceramic percussion. Sky Juice is a breathtaking song with very electronic synths and some jet sound effects with some thumping beats and a cool bass. However that is nothing like the next one. Cape Perpetual is beyond any word I can describe about this song. It's a very spooky track. It starts of with some strange breezy wind instruments and some thundering sounds in the distance. At about 30 seconds there are some synthesizer hums that fade in. The sound of the synth humming almost scared me at first listening. It then becomes a dark very space oriented song with ceramic percussion and thundering jet sound effects. I could close my eyes listening to this song and imagine myself traveling on the Orient Express through oriental space. This song alone makes this album a five star. Gentle Was The Night is a very beautiful song with just mostly synths. This is a great song. Fire Ritual is a very pop oriented song and some vocal doodling here and there. This is probably the brightest song on here. 87 Dreams Of A Lifetime lives up to the title. This is a very stunning and could rank as one of his best 80s tracks ever. It starts with just some ambient synths and the synths get louder and at about a minute into the song the real music begins. This is a haunting song with a catchy rhythm and a space jazzy stmosphere. This is my second favorite off this album. Dimension D is a very space oriented song with some haunting sound effects and a very dark ambient atmosphere. Forever The Optimistic is a pop oriented song with great electronic bass, a great hook and some synth tinklings throughout the song. I almost cryed when I first heard this song and today I consider this song a new age classic. Journey To Yoroba is another haunting song. It has lots of ceramic percussion and ambient synths. I love the drum loop to this song. The closing title track is great with more great synths and cool drums.All in all I rank this album as one Mr. O'Hearns strongest masterpieces to date.It's hard to really say how much I love this album because it really stimulates imagination in a way that none of his other albums can.In fact this album for a time is almost like the soundtrack my high school years because it reflects lonely I feel sometimes. In fact I strongly recommend this album to all who love music to listen to while thinking. It's very intelligent music that should be enjoyed by all generations.Well that's all I can say.Bye!Bye! I bought the cd for the song &#34;Forever the Optimist&#34; which was a difficult find until I searched and purchased on Amazon.com.This cd takes me back to the beginning days of WNUA urban contemporary and jazz radio station here in Chicago. I do wish I recognized more of the songs, but playing &#34;Forever the Optimist&#34; on repeat is good enough for me. I listened to Journey to Yoroba on Pandora and was absolutely blown away.After listening to that one song, I had to get the whole album.Between Two Worlds didn't disappoint with a wide variety of hauntinglydark, creative, ambient tracks that I still thoroughly enjoy. Of the 4 PO cd's I have this is my least favorite. After buying Indigo this was a disapointment. Ancient Dreams, Indigo and Beautiful World are much better with BW being outstanding. I'd like to start out by saying that it's nice to know there are others who are familiar with this music and appreciate it.  I've turned on a couple of friends to Patrick O'Hearn but other than that no one else I know is familiar with his work.  Some of the music in the movie &quot;White Sands&quot; is from &quot;Indigo&quot; and does a lot for the show.  That aside, &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot; is one of the best new age CD's you can buy and also one of O'Hearns best works.  I left a scrap of paper inside the CD case that has the tracks on it I like most: 1,3,6,7,9,10.  The other reviews have described this album well.  You have to like the new age sound to like this though.  It is quite repetitive in places but stills sounds excellent, even during a concentrated listen. I first bought this album in the late 80's, but lost it over ten years ago.  I bought it again recently and it still sounds good after all the years.  This recording has great sound detail and palpable bass frequencies.  Very listenable collection of songs. A replacement for a cassette i had years ago , easy listening for work, home, studying etc&#8230;.good music that allows you to relax and get things done or just sleep. Please, DO NOT ask me why I think of rainy days in Jefferson City, since I don't even live there...however, I did listen to the CD for the first time when I was in Jefferson City on a rainy day, so MAYBE that might have SOMETHING to do with it.  However, it's not the significance of Jefferson City that makes me like the song so much.  It's the fact that I love rainy days so much, that this song, in some way, has that passoinate effect on me that inspires my mind to reflect on my childhood and all of the people that I loved so much at that time...or maybe I am just a little bit not right in the head. A worthy successor to his debut recording &quot;Ancient Dreams&quot;.  Patrick maintains the same aesthetic here. Dark Beauty prevails but the pieces differ from the last recording. &quot;Rainmaker&quot; opens with a strong almost tribal pulse and a sense of drama that is almost cinematic.  &quot;Cape Perpetual&quot; and &quot;Dimension D&quot; convey the same kind of vistas that pieces like &quot;At First Light&quot; and &quot;Beauty in the Darkness&quot; convey but diffrently.  There is a pulse and an usual use of space in these two pieces which are two highpoints in this recording.  This is like an impressionist painting in vermillions, blues, purples and other exotic shades successfully evoking the emotions in a way much different than the more conventional recordings do.  Patrick's use of keyboards, synthesizers and bass is warmer and more musical than a great many of his dark ambient contemporaries.  A very human approach, no automation here. There is a soul here. O'Hearn's first outing as a solo artist in the 80's and this one showed promise and imagination for future projects. After Rivers Gonna Rise, Peter Baumann ex-Tangerine Dream begun collaborating with O'Hearn by producing and mixing his albums. The ex-dreamers influence can be found strongly in this album, Ancient Dreams and Indigo. The music here is getting close to new age, darker, moodier but still not missing the joyous and playful elements of Rivers.. or El Dorado particularly on ""Forever the Optimist"". Every track here has an impact on the listener depending on the interpretation and only PH can do it. Many of the songs here will carry you to the apex and then drop you gliding with satisfaction. An example is 87 Dream of a lifetime. This music was my life sountrack 20 years ago, in my moments of solitude I play the tape cassete now that I have it on cd the memories come in full vividness. The music here is timeless as best portrayed by the cover of a world over dry land. The world is hope and joy and the crack land is the melancholic side of this album.","Adult Alternative,Progressive,Jazz,Pop,New Age,Rock,Meditation,Electronic",two worlds another great cd patrick hearn noticed listened uses many sounds ancient dreams purchased amazon knowing two worlds loved listening first time heard patrick hearns indigo knew right get thought one best probably indigo favorite two worlds would okay start opinion indigo ancient dreams would better rain maker excellent one plays one tune adds dark sounds around gentle night soft soothing great keyboard sounds fire ritual uses variety voices along sounds dreams lifetime starts soft comes drums takes us title witch mostly tune little small two worlds great cd noticed listened sounds ancient ancient dreams dreams purchased amazon knowing worlds loved listening time heard indigo knew right thought best probably indigo favorite worlds okay start opinion indigo ancient ancient dreams dreams better rain maker excellent plays tune adds dark sounds gentle night soft soothing great keyboard sounds fire fire ritual ritual variety voices sounds dreams lifetime starts soft comes drums title witch tune
21,38,B0000000JE,"It has taken me a while to force myself to get a copy of this CD. The reason for this is because El Dorado features more daytime music. But, after hearing a few samples I decided to get the album. When I listened to the album I couldn't believe it! El Dorado is one of the best albums Patrick O' Hearn has done! It's much different than the dark, frightening sounds of Indigo where in this one he features more of music from the middle east. But in some songs he comes back with some of the same dark sounds from his previous work.""Amazon Waltz"" is great to start off the album. It gives you that feeling of being in the middle east with those different instruments. ""Napalese Tango"" is also one of my favorites with some of the same sounds. However, ""Black Delilah"" was a darker one. I would picture me walking around at night time. ""Chattahoochee Field Day"" gives me that daytime feeling with that nice soothing rythem. Some songs on the album feature voices like ""Hear Our Prayer"" and ""Delicate"". The songs with voices are okay but I kind of like the instrumental ones more. I loved every song on this album and I hope you do to.Some people out there who liked albums like Indigo or Trust might find El Dorado a bit dissappointing because it's more of daylight music. But I think this album is as good as his others. But I liked the darker ones more.I hope you all enjoy it!!! This is a great disc, the music is always fresh and very enjoyable. I have liked his music since the eighties. Would highly recommend this particular release if your new to this type of music or not. When you first get a Patrick album, the songs sound nice, but you don't love them immediately. You have to listen to each album every day for 2 weeks to fall in love with a few of the songs. I would call the style  &quot;Experimental Jazz-based New Age.&quot; Similar to Tangerine Dream,  but the sounds here are not so exotic. The whole album is good; the track  &quot;Chattahoochee Field Day&quot; is a masterpiece to me. It's my  FAVORITE song of his. Very bouncy and beautiful. 3 tracks even have voices  on them! As sound effects in &quot;Amazon Waltz,&quot; and as LYRICS(!) on  track 8, and &quot;chorus&quot; on 9. &quot;Nepalese Tango&quot; (#2), and  &quot;There's Always Tomorrow&quot; (#10) are also excellent. Metaphor and  Indigo are his only albums better than this one. Both have music similar to  this album. This is different from most of his earlier masterworks Ancient Dreams, Between Two Worlds and Rivers Gonna Rise. While this album has a lot of the trademark sound of the previous ones this album incorporates Middle Eastern and Mayan instruments to create a masterpiece in the world music category.Amazon Waltz is a jazzy song with Brazilian wind instruments and percussion plus some chants as well. Nepalese Tango is similar to the previous one but not quite as fast and has some worldly bells and drums. I could play this one when driving through the jungle with mountains nearby on a misty day. Black Delilah is a unique track that incorporates stunning cello performances as well as a violin to create a masterwork. Chattahoochie Field day is a very daytime song with bouncy rhythms and a very jazzy vibe to it. The Illuminator is a very electronic song with beautiful synths and some plucky instruments. At the middle of the song the synths sounds very much like the pluck instruments from Enyas Orinoco Flow. This is my favorite song. One Eyed Jacks is another typical jazzy O'Hearn song but still great. Hear Our Prayer is a song with Middle Eastern drums and chants. Delicate is a dark track with the trademark synthesizers but has beautiful haunting chants. The title track is a very intense with thundering rain sound effects and bells. One standout track in this album. There's Always Tomorrow is a somber yet happy track at the same track. It's a nice jazzy closer to this album.This is probably Mr. O'Hearns last daytime sounding album. This album is a definate masterpiece. It's totally different from the dark, chilling, frightning masterwork Indigo and all latter material that would follow. Definate buy this one. When I heard this i always thought this had to be a soundtrack to an adventure film. it had all the earmarks from start to finish. The adventure begins has a few sidetrips to various places around the globe and ends where the adventurer finds himself and what it was all about and that the adventure was better than it end result. Listen to each song, again, as i did and you to will see what i mean. Of all the new age cd's around, this is one of my favorites. No other cd stirs such a longing and desire in me... great for erotic lovemaking! I have Bose speakers, and I turn up the bass on this one! Wow! Patrick O'Hearn is known for evocative bass. By far, this is his best cd. Each track takes you deeper and deeper into your own body. It definitely resonates with the second chakra, stirring desire and sexual appetite! I LOVE to let my body move and dance to its exotic rhythms. And as an earlier review said, each time you listen to it, it gets better and better. Listen to this late at night when you are alone with yourself, or alone with a lover. The perfect blend of rhythms, synths and orchestrations.  Relaxation is not complete without this CD playing. I have had this CD since it was first released and have many fond associations with it, mostly hiking in the SE Utah desert. It's a true masterpiece and his absolute best. I wish more of his work was like this, that he hadn't gone all dark and moody. The cuts on this are either upbeat and energetic or perfectly pensive and melancholy, but in a good way, not dark. Amazon Waltz is just fantastic, my all-time fav. Also love the fretless bass. In my top 5 fav CDs of all time. I only have this and 'Rivers Gonna Rise' from Patrick O'Hearn but I look forward to get some more 'cos they're awesome. 'Eldorado' is much more of an exotic, world music oriented one, and has a little bit more deepness into its tracks, and a certain mystique dark feeling as well.'Amazon Waltz' is a great and moving start with a very fast percussion rythm, an Amazon screams and chants while a gorgeus acoustic guitar works along a very well studied melody.'Nepalese Tango' is a short but great mixture of synths, percussion and ethnic sounds, with a nice and happy ending.'Black Delilah' sounds very Eastern with the violin and is a strange and moody track.'Chattahochee Field Day' is a wonderful theme with a very driving drum beat rythm and a melancholic feel. The middle part is a burst of synthed pizzicatos and other sounds. The two basses, rythm and lead one, are very good. The follower is a friendly and fast song called'The Illusionist' full of nice synths and percussions. Sounds a little bit like a children's TV program but that is good!The second side opens with a very, very weird song called 'One Eyed Jacks' (well, the title's not specially convencional thinking about it). It's a very funny song with a funny fretless bass answering some funny synth sounds.'Hear Our Prayer' includes some Persian lyrics sung by a woman and there's a great bass work during the whole song. The next song,'Delicate' is a little masterpiece. Starting with a gloomy and soft synthesiser arpeggio, the by chance delicate voice of a girl whispers an extremely beautiful melody and the voices multiply on the chorus creating a wonderful choir with a very spiritual feeling. This song is a very must hear, a gem in itself. I don't particularly like the title track,'Eldorado', as I find it static and falsely grandious. It's for me the weakest part of the album. But the last song is probably the best one,'There's Always Tomorrow'. Begins with a very sentimental acoustic guitar and has a terrific middle part where the synthesiser sounds unfold like a prayer, and the fretless bass plays a beautiful octaved bit... the end is magic 'cos an optimistic rythm breaks the sadness of the song, until it fades away leaving you with a sigh for the beautiful album you've heard... This CD is a re-issue.  I have listened to the previous cassette  release at least once a year since it came out over five years  ago. Unfortunately, it has all been for naught because I cannot  convince myself that any track in this album is worth cueing up  - and believe me I have tried.  O'Hearn is not effective at teleporting us to his exotic titles,  entertaining us with the remarkable sounds of his equipment, nor  impressing us with musical genius.  What's left?  Can I dance  to it? Not if I am sober.  The only positive thing I can say (which keeps the 2nd star in  this review alive) is O'Hearn's background electronics can be  somewhat intriguing at times.  But the empty simplicity of the  melodic line insults our intelligence.  The mind drifts off the  music quickly, as it does not earn our attention.  If you are an O'Hearn fan, this is bottom-drawer O'Hearn.  At  best you can use El Dorado as party background music - as long  as there are other CDs in the player in random track play mode. EL Dorado gives you a picture of that mythical city of gold hidden somewhere in the jungles of South America. This album is actually a representation of that fabled land because it has all the qualities of every precious metal or stone as depicted in each song. This is world music with Latin, African and Arabian flavor without losing O'Hearns playfull, teasing, melacolic trademark sound. This a well balance album from the lively Cahatoochie Field day to the haunting El Dorado. The cover art is also a confused image of either an indigenous or conquistador an excelllent imagery of this album. Again O'Hearn is at his most creative peak. First of many albums I have collected of Patrick O'hearn music.Easy to listen to, and a pleasure to share with others. This is a masterpiece of modern compositions, original and deep. Music that has texture completly throughout the Frequency spectrum. Not just ambient noise but rhythm, harmony, and soothing melodic passages that seem worldly and un worldly. Love the deep bass lines and variety of different beats and rythms.Excellent intro to his music as it is more upbeat and lighthearted than most of his later work. If you have a good sound system it will suprise you with wonderfull sonics and all around recording finesse. I have been a fan of Patrick O'Hearn for over 10 years.  &quot;El Dorado&quot;  was my first exposure to his music and I still believe it to be his best.  Unlike keyboard artists such as Vangelis, O'Hearn integrates electronic instruments with acoustic, creating a &quot;landscape&quot; of sound that is truly extraordinary.  The &quot;rain stick&quot; on the title track is a perfect example of how he so masterfully intigrates primitive, acoustic instruments with the electronic.  With songs like &quot;Delicate,&quot; I have heard no other artist who can musically set a mood of such deep serenity.  All of O'Hearn's CDs are worth owning, but this one remains my all-time favorite. I've owned this disc since it's release over ten years ago and still enjoy it tremendously.  This is certainly one of PO's best!  It opens with the gallopping Amazon Waltz and closes with the acoustically founded song of hope and inspiration There's Always Tommorrow.  The Illusionist evokes images of slight of hand trickery where the ear is quicker than the eye. Chattahoochie Field Day brings to one's mind childhood thoughts of running through open fields of wheat, chest high in laughter.  One Eyed Jacks brings the picture playful deviance layered in sarcasm.  Delicate is powerful in it's projection of a synthetic bass line and Angelic vocal harmony.  And then there's the title track that I could not appreciate when I was younger and less experienced in the beauty that life has to offer in so many different lights.  Eldorado (the song)is a tremendous piece of artistry, full of majesty and imagery as you hear sedentary stone cascading through a miner's pan followed by the exhuberance of discovery.  What a volcano that track is.  Unquestionabley one of the most moving compositions I have ever had the sheer joy to experience.  On Eldorado we find 10 tracks, 8 of which I find outstanding.  Songs of exploration, conviction and strength.  Instrumentally we find Patrick at the peak of his synthetic arrangements.  Similar in instrumentation to his previous release RGR &amp; the folow up to Eldorado Indigo.  Later efforts would lend themselves to a tad more acoustic treatment as did music accross the industry from these eras.  Eldorado is a great piece of work, it will surely bring you on a journey like only a textbook O'hearn album can.  Sure to provide years of adventure, Eldorado stimulates, provokes and challenges.  In a word, Eldorado is atmsopheric textural music founded in synthesizers, electric bass, textural guitars and time marking percussion that introduces simple melodies and develops them fully.  The mood of Eldorado can be upbeat at times &amp; tracks, reverant at others and still power-centric at others.  Eldorado is wel worth the aquisition fee and the time it takes to truly discover it's adventurous beaty.  Just keep listening!!!

22,39,B0000000JW,"On this album, Andy Summers dumps his ""XYZ"" pop for new age instrumentalism, and even one listen to this album makes it pretty clear that this is his true post-Police calling. Working with a select group of notable musicians including the great Herbie Hancock, he, Hancock and others help to carefully create this album full of blazing guitar riffs, pounding drums, and well-arranged synthesizers. Highlights include the uplifting ""Mexico 1920"" and the darker but no-less-outstanding ""Rainmaker"" and ""Big Thing"". THIS CD IS REALY ENJOYABLE FOR MUSICIANS.YOU CAN HEAR SOME KING CRIMSON ON SOME PARTS WITH MORE FUSION FEEL.AND SOME AWESOME ATMOSPHERIC TRACKS LIKE RAINMAKER AND PASSION OF THE SHADOW.I'D LIKE TO SAY EVERY SONG ON THE RECORD IS A GREAT PIECE OF MUSIC.STING,HERBIE HANCOCK AND MARK ISHAM HAS PLAYED ON SOME TRACKS.AND WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THE DRUM LINES.THEY ARE REALLY FANTASTIC.CHAD WACKERMAN IS A WONDERFUL DRUMMER!AND ANDY SUMMERS IS NOTHING BUT AMAZING. This is Andy Summers as he hadn't been heard before. Summers flexes his musical muscle with wild abandon, penning bombastic, over-the-top jazz-rock fusion pieces and unleashing searing and flashy guitar leads, proving once and for all that he is far more than a minimalist master of rhythm, atmosphere, and texture.Summers' band here includes keyboardist David Hentschel, bassist Doug Lunn, and aptly named powerhouse drummer Chad Wackerman, with all-star assists by Summers' former Police band mate Sting and Darryl Jones on bass, jazz superstar Herbie Hancock and Brian Auger on keyboards, Ed Mann on percussion, Mark Isham on trumpet, and Bill Evans on saxophone.This is Summers' most extroverted album and, as such, will keep your ears wide open. The best Andy Summer record of all time. Released by then Peter Baumann's Private Music Label. I only heard to 2 tracks back in the late 80's from the Private Music sampler and it strongly struck me. A blend of new age? Jazz? Rock? Reggae? Pop? or all of the above. Supported by Chad Wackerman, Mark Isham et al this is vintage Andy Summers at his peak. Don't expect a Police record though one can hear Summer's guitar riffs reminiscent of his former band. A good addition for a taste of Andy Summer's post Police ventures.","New Age,Jazz,Pop,Jazz Fusion,Rock",andy summers dumps xyz pop new age instrumentalism even one listen makes pretty clear true post police calling working select group notable musicians including great herbie hancock hancock others help carefully create full blazing guitar riffs pounding drums well arranged synthesizers highlights include uplifting mexico darker less outstanding rainmaker big thing cd realy enjoyable musicians hear king crimson parts fusion feel awesome atmospheric like rainmaker passion shadow id like say every record great piece sting herbie hancock mark isham played say drum lines really fantastic chad wackerman wonderful drummer andy summers nothing amazing andy summers hadnt heard andy summers summers dumps pop new new age age instrumentalism listen pretty clear true post police police calling calling working select group notable musicians including great herbie hancock help carefully create full blazing guitar guitar riffs riffs pounding drums arranged synthesizers highlights include uplifting mexico outstanding rainmaker cd enjoyable musicians hear king crimson parts fusion feel awesome atmospheric rainmaker passion shadow say record great piece sting herbie hancock mark isham played say drum drum lines lines really fantastic chad chad wackerman wackerman wonderful drummer andy summers summers amazing andy summers summers heard
23,40,B0000000K2,"Love it!  One of my all-time favorite piano cd's! I can just put this CD on repeat and play it all day.I never tire of it.Each hearing reveals deeper layers of detail and musicality.The beauty of it will give you goosebumps. Not as expected; it's all piano compositions and dull. I'll keep it and go back to it periodically. It may become better. This is my go to CD to relax, meditate, read or just enjoy! I have even used some of the tracks for competitions. This remains my favorite CD from Suzanne (or anyone for that matter) I listen to this album most when it is raining, and when I'm writing in my journal or reading. It is very soothing. I put the song &quot;Inverness&quot; on repeat when I take baths by candlelight. Very  sensual, and intimate. Get it! As with her other CDs, this is beautifully relaxing.  I listened to the track samples and was not disappointed with this CD at all.  Highly recommend this artist. For the most part, I listen to video game music. Final Fantasy Online had a really nice article about music for people that like video game music (RPG music, to be precise). There were several video game soundtracks, movie soundtracks, etc.And . . .PianissimoI am not new to New Age (I've listened to and enjoyed the works of Yanni and Enya), but neither am I very knowledgable about it. In any case, I liked Yanni's piano pieces enough that I decided I'd get this CD.To be honest, not every song on &quot;Pianissimo&quot; is as great as I'd thought it would be. But on the other hand, I ended up liking a lot of the songs that the website didn't mention.Tracks 6 and 12 (titled &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Mozart&quot; respectively) are my favorites.&quot;Rain&quot; is definitely a piece to be listening to while it's raining (raining softly, not hard). Also try listening to it while enjoying a beautiful sunrise on a cloudy day.&quot;Mozart&quot; is by far my favorite track on the CD, but it's extremely difficult to put into words exactly why I like it.In addition to those two, I liked &quot;Neverland&quot;, &quot;Inverness&quot;, and &quot;Simple Song&quot;.I must admit that after listening to this CD I can't help but wish that I knew how to play the piano.If you like the music from the Final Fantasy games, then you'll definitely want to check this CD out. It's good music to listen to while you're at a more peaceful part of your game.Write to it, read to it, sleep to it, but most of all, listen to it. This was just a replacement copy for me; I've worn out one and landed up sharing the replacements in the past with friends who are just as taken with this as I was.  It's wonderful to use as background music or just to relax with. Pianissimo is one of my favorite albums.  I have listened to it 100's of times.  It is peaceful, deeply moving, inspiring and somewhat melancholic and romantic.  No other album in my collection is quite like it.  Put it on when you need to reflect and meditate.  She is a very talented soul. This collection of solo piano tunes is an excellent way to relax at home or in the car. The melodies are beautiful! I've been a big Suzanne Ciani fan for years. This is a must have!  Many of the songs can be sight read...beautiful songs that I really enjoy playing After something like a twenty year career as a composer of electronic music sometime in 1989 or 1990 Suzanne Ciani began to move back to her original roots as an acoustic instrument player.  For a musician who had come up through the ranks working on a massive Buchla synthesizer, moving in and out of tonalities, flirting with space music, this was a great sea shift.  While the artist rarely focuses on the motivations behind the change in interviews what we know is that physical illness triggered a move to the West Coast and that some internal process refocused her on the melodic.&quot;Pianissimo,&quot; her first fully acoustic piano recording.  Other than a few original pieces, this live performance draws primarily from Neverland and History of My Heart.  The shift to piano makes the inner workings of these pieces far more transparent, allowing more of Ciani's intentions (she talks of &quot;My Italian roots and a sense of melody&quot;) to come clear.  This in turn allows new ideas to work within the discipline and bounds of the piano's world.  The net product is something that sounds familiar, but which is more than a passive adoption of old conventions.Ciani lacks something of the New Age technical brilliance of  a Michael Jones or a George Winston, but she has the same ability to deliver a performance that is creative and compelling.  This is a connection that I did not feel with some of here earlier work.  She has gone on from this point to develop an eclectic style that marries elements of all the worlds she has worked in.  This album is a great example of a musical turning point and has made a fan out of me. I love Suzanne Ciani's acoustic music recordings, which are completely different from her electronic music.  Hate a previous recording of one of her songs? try the Pianissimo version- and you will be pleasantly surprised, and deeply moved by the experience.  This album has some truly breathtaking songs - Rain and Tuscany for instance - but what I find disappointing is the selection of songs for the album itself.  Their melodies are fragmented, like little snippets of ideas.  It is a peculiarity that I am not sure Suzanne herself noticed, and the result is that the album feels a little artificial to me - more like electronic SOUNDS gathered together then converted to music, rather than music from the get go. I really dislike Adagio - one reviewer had commented for Pianissimo II that Suzanne bangs the piano keys, and for this song, I tend to agree. I understand melodically why she wants to bang a particular note, but I still do not agree with it.  I guess her point is to make that song disturbing, and if that is her goal, she wins - the song is disturbing.I also do not like the piano this album is recorded on - I have heard different versions of Berceuse, for instance, and this recording is not nearly as good as the other ones, I think because she is using a different piano.  This one sounds a little on the tinny side.  Some people like this, I do not, because it makes Berceuse sharper sounding, and sharp in not a good way. The version on her Dreams and Meditations album is lovely, she really gets it right there.If you are looking for something soothing to listen to (except Adagio, and you don't care about the mechanics of piano technique (ie a true listener) then I highly recommend this album. Nobody else I know understands what I am talking about when I criticize this album, and my criticisms are limited to very specific things.  I note that pianists are brutal with the piano playing of others, so I suspect all the negative press is generated by other musicians.  We all think we play it better. Suzanne herself is curious about different interpretations of her own music, and her own incredible reworking of her own songs suggests that nothing is carved in stone - she is very interested in other interpretations. She is also the first to admit that she is not the most technically gifted pianist - her gift is her songwriting ability.  She also does not always obey her own notations either, so I tend to think that there is a lot more leeway in the song than one might expect.  Pianists:  this is still a great listen.  Everybody else:  this is a must own album. A very good mix of &quot;acoustic&quot; piano works that are soothing after a long day. The pieces flow well into each other, making the cd less a collection of works and more a work to enjoy. Definately a must have. This is a beautiful album, but there seems to be a catch if you buy it in CD format.  Although the CD which I purchased arrived without a scratch and plays quite well directly, repeated attempts to import it into iTunes always resulted in lots of skips in the music; a comparison of the same song in the iTunes store and the Amazon MP3 store revealed no such issue with the already-digitized versions.  So, if you're buying this with the thought that you'll put it on your iPhone or iPod, I recommend that you buy it in digital form to start with. It's rare to find a CD that has energy but is calming at the same time.  I think Ms. Ciani does this very well.  The music is very flowing and peaceful, but there's a moving energy through the different pieces that keeps you from zoning out.  She's an accomplished artist, and I enjoyed this CD very much.  I'm looking forward to purchasing another by her. This is the first of the series of albumns where Suzanne Ciani play her previous tracks on piano only.Hearing these tracks play, one may think that they were originally written for piano only but they are not. Anthem has a very national mourning and salute feel to it. Rain is perfect for a rainy day where the rain drops gently tab against the windows. She Said Yes almost represent the joy when one says yes to a marriage proposal. Every track has a meaning, every note - an emotion that fits it beautifully.Suzanne is one of the only artist that is able to composed a track that rhymes, unlike other more abstract works of others.Do get it and consider the rest of her wonderful albums like Pianissimo II, III, Hotel Luna, Dream Suite &amp; The Private Music of Suzanne Ciani.

24,43,B0000000KI,"Jennifers' voice is in perfect form and many songs approach the transcendant quality that both  ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" and ""The Well"" effortless acheived.  Stand outs for me are, ""Rock You Gently,"" and ""The Hunter."" Great Vocals and arrangements. Superbly recorded. A great addition for the audiophile or any lover of pop/folk. I wish all the songs were top notch. Ms Warnes has such a wonderful, delightful voice. I'm sure she could have selected one or two better songs.  But there are two that stand out that make the entire CD worth buying. The title song, &quot;The Hunter,&quot; took me a few listenings to really appreciate it. But it has become my second favorite.  The best song has to be &quot;Lights of Lousianne.&quot; Not only for the sound, but also for the meaning. Perhaps it is only my interpretation, but the last line of the song sums it all up.  The rest of the songs I would rate from a high &quot;B&quot; to a low &quot;C.&quot;  All in all, I am glad I bought the CD, and would recommend to anyone who is a Jennifer Warnes fan. Or to anyone who would like to hear a truly talented artist. For almost three decades, Jennifer Warnes has been one of the most reputable composers and singers in popular music. The Hunter shows that she is just as successful with light jazz and R&amp;B as with other musical  genres. The album includes gently swaying melodic songs with hushed vocal  harmonies (Rock You Gently), touches of jazz saxophone and funk guitar  (Somewhere Somebody, Big Noise New York), and light-heartened melodies with  playful staccato strings (The Hunter). The bass (I believe stand-up)  playing is understated and curiously improvisational (Big Noise New York,  True Emotion, The Hunter). Michael Landau, studio extraordinary for almost  20 years (assisting the likes of Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, B.B. King,  Rod Stewart and Pink Floyd) provides the savory guitar  refrains.Jennifer's voice is a fitting instrument for clarity of  delivery - every phrase is clearly audible. She's also capable of  pleading  words to ecstasy (Pretending To Care). Hidden among nine mid-tempo tunes is  a glorious and powerful surprise which raises the roof: `The Whole Of The  Moon'. The driving drums, majestic choir, exalted trumpeting and Jennifer's  zealous voice push this soaring tune high above all the others.Technical  note: the DDD recording uncovers each gentle touch of triangle (Somewhere,  Somebody), hi-hat (True Emotion) and rattle (Way Down Deep). Amidst countless albums that were popular around this time period in music in the summer of 1992, there is a major classic pop album that stands out in my book from this time period and that album is the now overlooked gem ""The Hunter"" by Jennifer Warnes. My favorite song is likely ""Rock You Gently"" with it's beautiful lyrics and Jen's beautiful vocals.  This Cd's poetic nature and beautiful songs makes it an eternal gem in my book. No way would I ever give anything she is associated with from the &#34;Black and White&#34; Roy Orbison to all the work she did  with Leonard Cohen. If she recorded the phone book I would buy it. Her voice has a quality that has an effect on me like no other. this album has it all.The hunt is over. Jennifer warnes voice is incomparable - her range and depth are world class.For me the hunt is but a memory.This album deserves to be up on the wall beside your most treasured  trophies. Jennifer Warnes output is very low by pop standards which is why she is not to be considered to be a pop singer but rather an artistic vocalist. A rarified group in the business of music today. Jennifer releases a very highly crafted disc every four or five years and they always prove to be worth the wait. The tunes are very carefully considered as is the disc as a whole piece. The quality of the production (sonics) is second to none.A full, rich warm bodied sound that establishes a benchmark for all others to aspire to (but very few do .... unfortunately). Why is it that so many others produce discs which are characterised by poor production values and that someone such as Jennifer continually provides you with such a glorious sound listening experience. She is a true artist who obviously holds her work and her audience in the highest regard.thank you Jennifer. This is a really great CD! Jennifer Warners has a marvelous voice and the artistic proposal is fascinating, what's more the recording quality is excellent This recording is one of my very favorites. Nearly every song reaches deep  within to trigger a different emotional response. While 'Famous Blue  Raincoat' is a wonderful collection of cover songs, 'The Hunter' is much  different.  I still buy this CD for gifts, and hardly a week goes by when I  don't listen to it.There is no doubt that Jennifer's voice is truly  special...clear and piercing in the most positive way.  Don't wait...BUY  IT! This underappreciated, timeless gem is a must-have. No one has ever come close to equalling Jennifer's version of Todd Rundgren's beautiful ballad &quot;Pretending to Care,&quot; -- her version has moved several people,  myself included, to tears. When she sings that song's line, &quot;Please  don't let me down now,&quot; your heart will go out to her (or you don't  have one). Warnes is a magnificent singer, and this album shows her coming  into her own as a songwriter, too -- her title track puts her in Sondheim's  territory. In this song, she puts a metaphorical spin on gender roles, and  also suggests the spirit that animates this album as a whole -- she tries  varying styles on the search for something beautiful and pure, with  sparkling success. Warnes is a national treasure, and we can only hope that  she will release another album soon. I stumbled on the greatness that is Jennifer Warnes.  Like most, I knew her peripherally by the movie themes she charted with.  In the early 90's I happened to be shopping for a new CD player and Famous Blue Raincoat was in the player.  The minute I heard it, it sounded like nothing I had ever heard.  I bought the CD and it has been one of my top 10 favorites since then.  It's unfortunately clear why she did not have the conventional pop success.  There is no one like her.  She's evocative of Joni Mitchell and possibly Judy Collins, but not really.  She is truly an original.  I bemoaned the fact that she seemed to disappear from the recording studio.  Fate intervened again and I stumbled on the fact that she had indeed recorded two additional CD's, ""The Hunter"" and ""The Well"".  I immediately ordered both.  So far I have only listened to The Hunter and again she proves her brilliance again.  As mentioned in other reviews, ""Pretending To Care"" is heartbreaking.  I also particularly like ""Rock You Gently"" and ""The Hunter"".  All of the songs are gems.  Another Jennifer Warnes CD in my top 10.  I can't wait to listen the next CD ""The Well"". Jennifer Warnes releases so few albums that when a new one comes out, it's reason to celebrate.  But as her first release after her classic, sadly out of print FAMOUS BLUE RAINCOAT album, Jennifer Warnes' THE HUNTER is a bit  of a disappointment.  It must have been a daunting task to try and follow  up that flawless album, and Jennifer succeeds only partially in making this  as satisfying a listening experience. The first half of this album just  doesn't work, and it only comes alive with track 5 and her beautiful cover  of Todd Rundgren's &quot;Pretending to Care&quot;.  &quot;Lights of  Louisane&quot; is also very beautiful, showcasing Jennifer's lovely vocals  and phrasing.  The two best tracks are her rocking cover of The Waterboy's  &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;, where she picked the tempo up and  improved on their original version, and her-self penned title track,  &quot;The Hunter&quot;, with it's intricate string and vocal arrangements  displaying her considerable writing skills and making it one of the best  recordings of Jennifer's career.Any Jennifer Warnes album is always  worthwhile.  Any chance to hear her beautiful, imcomparable vocals should  be jumped at.  But one can't help but hope that her next one will be a  better showcase for her many talents. In my opinion, while I enjoy all of the CD's I buy, only one out of every hundred or so hits the mark completely on all counts on every track: quality of all the songs (music &amp; lyrics), arrangements, performance, and recording engineering. This is clearly one of them. Jennifer Warnes is a superb vocalist who interprets lyrics with feeling. If you like good lyrics and stories, she chooses some of the best material you'll find on any CD. She is a unique talent and gifted musician/vocalist. I love the emotions and pictures I see when I listen to her sing. I can listen to this CD over and over and over, and never ever get tired of listening. I also love all of her other CD's, particulalry Famous Blue Rain Coat, but I have to admit, this is my favorite. Listen up record executives, my only disappointment is that she doesn't have more recordings for me to buy! Okay, I can't say for certain what it is about this CD that draws me back to listen to it over again; I just know that when I got my MP3 player it was one of the first discs I reached for to download.  I think it's the quiet of it and the charm of some of the cuts.  Warnes voice is so clear and haunting in its ability.  When I need to feel quiet and calm this is the one I go to.  ""Lights of Lousianne"" is as close to an adult lullaby as one could hope to hear, and it often brings tears to my eyes.  So, if you're looking for music that is good to listen to as you drift to sleep, or you just need to take a break from the tumult of the day, I'd recommend this one to you.  It might not be the most earth moving music you've heard, but it sure does calm you down.  Always a good thing for most of us! This album is never far away from me.  It is another excellent effort by Jennifer Warnes who is quite possibly one of the greatest interpreters of contemporary adult music.  Great mixes and provocative songs enhance the experience.  Buy it now. One of the most underrated singers. Her voice,delivery,style is perfect!The Hunter,a beautiful effort by Jennifer,especially ""Lights of Louisann""If you like this album, you need to get ""Shot Thru The Heart"" This is a great CD.  Most the songs are excellent and her voice is stunning.  Superb recording also.  You must own this CD. I've had the album that Jennifer made with all songs by Leonard Cohen called ""Famous Blue Raincoat."" So I thought I'd try ""The Hunter."" She doesn't even sound like herself.....that ""crying voice"" I always loved. That's about all I have to say about this CD. Thanks for reading my short revies. ""Famous Blue Raincoat"" instantly became one of my favorite albums of all time (I bought it at the same time as ""A Capella"" by Rundgren from which ""Pretending to Care"" from ""Hunter"" came) and have hoped to recapture that magic in another album by Warnes. From reading the reviews here, I thought ""Hunter"" would be that album. Not. I can't imagine any album short of Air Supply that sounds more dated. Warnes sounds fine, but the material and production sounds dated even for the 1990s, especially in the first half with sappy keyboard work and drum tracks abounding. Even the fab Rundgren tune, so passionate and pained on ""A Capella"" becomes an empty shell of a tune on this go round.Please someone, save me. Point me to the Warnes album that will catch me up again... This is one of my favorite albums and the sonics have always been wonderful - even on 16 bit cd. So I was hoping that a new vinyl pressing would at least do it justice.I am happy to report that the new pressing is absolutely amazing. This great, great work has never sounded as fantastic. Very quiet too.They pressed only 8,000 copies, so I would not wait long to get one. (I plan to get a backup in case a chipmunk climbs down the chimney and crawls across the turntable...).I normally don't get duplicates, but this is soooo good and reasonably affordable compared to most of my best pressed titles.The serial number on mine is in the 3,000 plus range, but it sounds like the finest of white label promos. I imagine the 7,999 other copies are just as killer.Adding a note after a few more days of playing this record:W O W ! This is heavenly listening. Trust me. Get this and it'll join your finest pressings as a system tester/show off piece.Thank you Jennifer, Bernie Grundman and Cisco. This woman's voice will transport you. ""Pretending to Care"" is the standout here. You'll really get it when you hear Warnes sing it. I got this CD primarily for &quot;Rock You Gently&quot;, but &quot;Somewhere, Somebody&quot;, &quot;Way Down Deep&quot;, &amp; &quot;Pretending to Care&quot; make this an excellent collection.  Having  only ever had her Greatest Hits CD which boasts  &quot;Right time of the  Night&quot; made me come to appreciate Jennifer Warnes' voice.  This  appreciation was  deepened w/ The Hunter.  The vocals along with the  music  make this a terrific CD and one for any music lover's collection. I listened to the entire album and no problems. not a scratch on the cd. I got a great deal and they sell quality stuff. The sound quality is excellent, the most beautiful packaging I have seen (or touched) feels silken to the touch on the outside, and like The Well, has all the words to the songs.  I like listening to both these albums in a quiet room to enjoy the great words in all the songs, and feel the emotion Jennifer puts into each word with no interuptions, great night time listening when you are relaxed. Background listening doesn't  do it justice, the better your system the more you willlike it, it is FLAWLESS and BEAUTIFUL. The material of Jennifers is FRESH, not just another overplayed cover. The fewcovers are great though.If you load this into iTunes, when the track list is downloaded you will see that song 2, Somewhere Somebody,is spelled Somwhere Somebody... don't edit that to Somewhere Somebody, UNLESS you also edit Max Carl fromthe credit TOO or this song will no longer appear, and your song list will be 1,3,4,...10.  and a new album will appearunder Max Carl's name, containing ONLY the now missing song 2. (The misspelling of Somewhere is intentional tokeep this from happening done by those that make the song list data base.  It is a quirk in itunes they are fixing  to keep number 2 where it belongs, and give proper credit to Max Carl.Some Columbia CDs, and SACD ones DO have the track list on the CD, and my Hi-end Sony SACD Shows them, butthat is rare, and the error is NOT a CD problem.Back to the CD itself, I first loved Way Down Deep, and The Hunter but after a few listens to the whole album,I like all the songs, they grow on you, and I now like this one as much as The Well.I finally found a place to get Jennifer's Blue Raincoat 24k one!  I Love all three!MrBruceThose are free programs, and I certainly have no problem with how they did it.  AT HOME, we don't need to give credit,so correct Somewhere, delete Max's name at the same time, and all is WELL!  oops, this para moved.  (I refer to ITunes andTrack List.) Simply one of my favorite albums.  I've owned it for many years and it never grows old.  Highly recommended. While there are no standout masterpieces on this album it is extremely good pop music, very listenable.  &quot;The Whole Of The Moon&quot; and &quot;Pretending To Care&quot; hit home with their mature and complex lyrics of loves many twists and turns. I have always wished that Warnes had had more commercial success with these great albums she does so infrequently. For those of you who appreciate beautiful music making any version of The Hunter is a must.However for an even closer view of those wonderful sessions,the remastered version is a no brainer,providing a new level of clarity & musical articulation that doesn't exist on the original.Sit back & emerse yourself. If you like soul-searching lyrics set to transcending melodies, you're going to want this album. This is a fantastic recording. while it might not be every one's cup of tea music-wise, it is a very, very excellent recording that can be used as a reference when auditioning stereo equipment and testing the capabilities of the equipment to reproduce bass -- specifically tracks 2 and 8. But also the title track which has a huge range to show the strenghts or weaknesses of any system. I recommend it. I have waited a long time to write my &quot;review&quot; for &quot;The Hunter.&quot;  As a long time devoted fan of Jennifer Warnes, I wanted to do the album justice.  My heart skipped several beats when I first heard  that she was releasing a new album in 1992.  It was a long wait after her  critically acclaimed album, &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; in 1986  (re-released on the Private label in 1991.)  I was not disappointed in the  least, only that the album lasted 46 minutes.  I found the album to be a  wonderful collection of songs and music with that beautiful voice of hers.  I could listen to Jennifer sing all day long.  There is something  hauntingly painful and all knowing in her voice and yet there is strength  and beauty there also.  Her arrangements and vocals are so beautiful and  her song writing is pure and mature.  I love every song on the album yet  her song &quot;I Can't Hide&quot; does it for me.  If you have ever loved  and lost or if you have had any kind of pain in your life, close your eyes  and listen to Jennifer sing this song.  It is her song to herself.  It is  so powerful and so moving that it often brings tears to my eyes.  At other  times it fills my heart with a calm sense that everything will be ok. Thank  you Jennifer. And to the critic Phil, get a life!  The song &quot;The  Hunter&quot; is not a tribute to the sport of killing animals but a fun  metaphoric twist on the act of finding someone falling in love with them.  Geez, must everything be intrinsically serious? I never heard this album before today. It seemed that every 'Audiophile' magazine and website has praised this as `the' tour de force. Brilliant, amazing recording, mastering, pressing, etc. I had high hopes and was truly looking forward to listening to it. I had heard the little samples on Amazon and thought they were... OK.The good: Her voice is wonderful and I could listen to her for hours. A couple of the songs are somewhat worthy of the praise they have received.The bad: Everything else. The songs are an over-produced mess of overdubs and echo's. Echo's. I mean really, this kind of late-disco era tripe went out long before this album was originally cut in 1992. This sounds like something Michael Macdonald put out in the mid `80's. `The Whole of the Moon' is so layered with echo and reverb and what???? Talk-over?? Really? You kidding me? I really expected M. Macdonald to come popping out of `Big Noise, New York'... Fagen's influence is felt, and I get it, but here it is; the worst of his sensibilities made cheesy and commercialized for those who need their emotions injected into their veins instead acting as inspiration.For all those `audiophile's who talk up Bernie Grundman's mastering... well, how would you know? Elliot Scheiner's ham-fists are all over this, creating a claustrophobic mash-up of sound effects and processing. How would anyone really know what's well-mastered or mixed about this heavily synthesized mess?The opening track is a perfect example of one issue with this CD. It's mastered so loud (Brick Wall effect) that the waveforms are clipped. This has lead to a harsh sibilance and raspy sound to her voice (sssshshshshshs) when singing 'S' or 'SH'. Cymbals and crescendo's are distorted and the bass has been pumped over the top. This is probably not the case with the LP, but this GOLD CD is just awfully compressed (all but the quietest tracks) and not worthy of the 'Audiophile' praise it has received. Loud and compressed may sound 'punchy', but it is not right or good.OK, maybe I just don't get it, and I must admit that most of its production and style certainly clashes with my overall tastes, but what I do like about this album is hidden behind outdated... even for 1992... `orchestrations' and synthetic 'keyboards'.The best track is the title track. Simple and relatively clean with Warnes' voice up front and center with the instruments mostly unprocessed and honest. But even this wonderful little song is weighed down at times with layers of overdubs put down by someone with auditory horror-vacui.If I wanted over-'instrumentalized' pseudo drama, I'd buy a Sade album. Warnes beautiful voice and talent needs to come through loud and clear. It doesn't deserve this disservice.And here's the big question... why all the hype? Why this re-mastering 18 years on? Gold disc, & 180 gm LP... for what? As I said, maybe I just don't get it. Even The Beatles didn't get gold discs and LP's for their massively overhyped `remastering'. This over-produced mess cost me $30. This is pandering, it's really unfortunate, and I'm irritated at myself for falling for it.Caveat Emptor... Don't take all some of the negative hype you've heard about this CD.  While it is true that Warnes work on this album is not a smooth as her earlier work this is nonetheless worth your while!  Songs like Big Noise, New York, and Rock you Gently make the album worth buying in and of itself.  Sadly, this album has become an import which means it's more expensive.  But if you love her voice as much I do...get it...I promise you won't be disappointed. Great music, I love this CD. I heard a few tracks at a audio equipment demo, I could not get the music out of my head. It sounds great at home too.... Although I find this to be the premiere showcase for a supremely underrated singer-songwriter, three tracks elevate it to near-greatness.  They are the Donald Fagen penned &quot;Big Noise, New York,&quot; which sounds for all the world like a Steely Dan song sung by a female (with Fagen on backup vocals); the oft-mentioned heartfelt cover of Todd Rundgren's ultimate breakup song &quot;Pretending To Care;&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;The Hunter,&quot; which, with its string quartet accompaniment, pristine vocal and oddly playful lyrics combine to make one of the most perfect songs I've ever heard.  Warnes has been unjustly maligned and relegated to &quot;movie title song singer&quot; status, but this album proves that she is (and always has been) an artist worthy of standing alongside greats like Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell.  A wonderful, wonderful CD. Got to love the song Rock You Gently, one of the best ever written. And oh my goodness what a group of talented musicians on this one. The sound is awesome and some very unusual instruments are used to create what I consider to be the best one from Jennifer.Sincerely,Vicki B. Holton This The Hunter edition is wonderful. If you are a audiophile or not, this CD will change your idea about real music! There is no background noise! The stereo is complete!

25,44,B0000000L0,"What a great CD.  I am a huge fan of Brasilian music.  The variety of artists is fantastic.  I'm listening to this CD a lot.  You won't be disappointed. Both albums, The Brasil Project, I and II, should be a part of the collection of anyone who truly values outstanding quality in every way: musical themes,interpretation and performance, great recording sound and  mixing.Thielemann et al are true to their great names and reputations. The  list of the best would be all and too long. If you like Toots Thielemans this a CD you won't tire of.Toots has long been the master on the harp.He truly elevates this instrument from one of a novelty type to one of serious  distinction.It is an exemplary recording of Brazilian Jazz, laid back easy listening at it's best.A must for every serious collector. Great meetings !Lots of Brazillian artists/vocalists I was not familiar with.Nice accoustics and ensembles.Molto molto ben ! I play this all the time, so relaxing, what a groove. Have listened to it for years (on tape) and it's always fresh. I love both the harmonic playing of Thielmans and Brazilian jazz.  So combined one would expect something interesting.  This album is good but he does a much better job in II, his second Brasil Project album; This first project drags a bit in comparison and does not have the same energy. But still good listening. I have always loved the harmonica and Brasilian music since I was a kid in the 60's. To find the pairing in this album was a real joy. Think of it, getting one of the greatest harmonica player/whistler and the music of Ivan Lins. The mix of the two blends into a sound that is fresh, lifting, and delightful to listen. All the cuts are flawless perfection of talent. My personal favorite was ""Casa Forte"". If you are a fan of Bossa Nova you will love ""The Brazil Project"". A great addition to any collection.European Quartet Live I love Toots, I have seen him perform several times, his music hits me deep.  This is right up with Affinity as his most intense music, a word not usually associated with Brazillian music.  The singers and all the other performers match him perfectly.  And to finish off with a rollicking Bluesette is the icing on the cake.  Thank you Toots!!!! IF you crave a soft sensual old world sound by a master musician this is it! This album will transport you to a Brazilian beach complete with hammock and capirino. Buy this to feed your soul! Jazzy, Brazilian, and Harmonica..After you get to know the tune, you will find that every track is so good. Of course, I bought this album becasue of Bluesette, but I am totally, happily bought this CD, for years, it has been my main tune in the condo along with its album II. A CD that you get bored with so fast and want to either sell or give away, a keeper for sure and for long long time. Must have. Toots is down in 'smile a mile wide' cruise zone here, with the soul-stirring sounds of Brazil's finest muso's-vocalists coming along for a ride you are bound to regret ending. Stellar line-ups 'to die for' sometimes misfire, but not on this album. It's sweet as Amazonian honey. Granted, no radical boundary pushing found here, but don't hold the civilised, comfortable tone against it. The sound is impeccably balanced, light and sensual. So harmonically tasteful it's bound to make you turn the lights down low and.... ooh la la. Life is better than good with Toots and the Gang in fine, serenade form. This is a fantastic album putting together some of the best Brazilian composers since Tom Jobim with the Great Toots on Harmonica, the only great composer he missed from Brazil? Jo&aacute;o Donato and that is unforgivable. Other than that, it is a Must-Have Collection. Toots Thielemans has been the leading harmonica player in Jazz music for over 50 years.  With this CD, he explores Brazilian Jazz and makes it sound like it was created just for him.  On this recording he has gathered some outstanding Brazilian Jazz musicians and let them do their thing while he adds his always splendid harmonica playing to the project.  With the exception of his signature piece ""Bluesette"", all of the songs are Brazilian Jazz pieces and they are arranged beautifully.If you are a fan of Brazilian Jazz I think that this recording will surprise and delight you.  If you're a Toots fan, you won't be surprised, just delighted. Another hit CD by Toots Thielemans with all the great Brazilian greats on it, it is very beautiful for jazz lovers. Bluesette, no other rendition can beat this version - in my opinion. Many other tracks were very very good. One track impressed me very much sounded like a paloma blanca soaring over a white mission tower in a hot summer day, made me think of leisure, freedom,tranquility, and joy.Never thought that harmonic can make wonderful music like this album did. This is one of those albums that deserves a higher rating than five stars. It is one of the finest bossa nova/Brazilian albums ever recorded, and among the best of all jazz albums. The musicianship and raw, primitive vocals are splendid, and Toots Thielemans is at his finest complementing his colleagues at times and soaring on his own at others. ""The Brasil Project 1 & 2"" are two of my ten ""desert island"" albums and they're the most-played songs on my iPod. If you want to hear how great this music really is, take both albums along next time you're on a long airplane flight, plug in your earbuds, tilt the seat back, close your eyes, and listen to every note. It's almost a religious experience. :-) Beautiful album. Thielmans harmonica blends wonderfully with Brazilian samba. The musicians are clearly simpatico with one another and sound like they were having a great time working together.","Brazil,Swing Jazz,Jazz,South & Central America,Latin Pop,Brazilian Jazz,Latin Music,Pop,World Music,Bebop,Latin Jazz",great cd huge fan brasilian variety artists fantastic im listening cd lot wont disappointed brasil project ii part collection anyone truly values outstanding quality every way musical themes interpretation performance great recording sound mixing thielemann et al true great names reputations list best would long like toots thielemans cd wont tire toots long master harp truly elevates instrument one novelty type one serious distinction exemplary recording brazilian jazz laid back easy listening best must every serious collector great meetings lots brazillian artists vocalists familiar nice accoustics ensembles molto molto ben play time relaxing groove listened years tape always great cd huge fan variety artists fantastic listening cd lot wont disappointed brasil project collection truly values outstanding quality way musical musical themes themes interpretation performance great recording sound sound mixing mixing true great names reputations list best long like toots toots thielemans cd wont tire toots long master harp truly elevates instrument novelty type distinction exemplary recording brazilian brazilian jazz jazz laid laid back easy listening best collector great meetings lots artists familiar nice ensembles ben play play time time relaxing groove listened years tape
26,45,B0000000L2,"These days, ""Dick [Clark], I'll give it an 85 -- I can wash my car to it"" seems to translate into ""I'll give it an 85 -- I use it to focus on my chakras.""  :-)Just what the world needs -- more meandering fluffy [stuff] that lacks substance, direction and form. This is a perfect example of what some people absolutely despise about too much of the ""New Age"" music that's out there.If you want to relax or meditate (or whatever activity that you ""do"" to music) and you just need some sort of sonic ""wallpaper"" in the background, then by all means, buy this CD -- it's basically no worse or no better than a ton of other ""stuff"" that's out there -- for that matter, just put on a tape of the sound of ocean waves crashing....HOWEVER, if you actually intend to LISTEN to music (and it's not going to just serve as a background for other activity), then I suggest you look elsewhere.If you want to stick to ""New Age"" genre, then I humbly offer a few suggestions (by no means a complete list, just a few jumping off spots):Liz StoryGeorge WinstonPaul Winter (especially ""Common Ground"")OregonAt least all of the above-mentioned are on speaking terms with concepts like form, sturcture, harmonic and melodic development, (importantly) ""rhythm as a primary musical element,"" etc.And, for what it's worth, I am a professional musician.Sincerely yours,Bob Abner All of her work is what I call music of the deep soul. Start here and expand out to her other work. You will never be disappointed, always delighted and  forever uplifted.Namaste. As far as &quot;New Age&quot; music goes, there is very little I find worthwhile.  This album from keyboardist Suzanne Ciani is wonderful!  A &quot;best of&quot; collection (with some new works), from  Grammy  Nominated Suzanne Ciani.  Music from the heart inspired by the sea and the  classics.  Highly recommend for any fan of New Age or keyboard music. This is soothing music whether you choose to fall asleep to it, eat dinner to it, relax to it............anything.  Simply beautiful.  So glad I found this artist--highly recommended!!! About eighteen months ago I accidently stumbled upon Suzanne's music at my office while listening to a music research website. I had never heard of her before... so I clicked on this album. As I listened, I felt sweet  goosebumps all over me!  Immediately after the music stopped, I searched  online for this album and bought it. She is an EXTREME talent, both in her  musical compositions, and in her performances at the keyboard!  Her music  is somthing that is experienced!  It's pure love in the form of musical  notes... expressions straight from her heart, and played so gently and  delicately with pure tenderness.  Her hands gently caressed my heart as  they gently played her notes of pure magic.  It is the most romantic  instrumental music I have ever heard in my life!  Listen to  ""Berceuse"" and let her music flow like a beautiful river of love  into your heart!  Feel her absolute devotion in ""The Velocity of  Love""... and as you listen to ""The Fifth Wave"" feel the joy  of a family of dolphins dancing together in the sea.  For those of you who  are musicians that studied music as your major with your entire heart and  soul, you'll notice her loving use of suspended fourths througout this  album.  Her music combines piano and synthesizers with such beauty that the  only way to describe it would be to say that it's true love in the form of  music!  Listen VERY closely to ""Berceuse"".  Far off in the  background you will hear a synthesizer reflecting perfectly what she plays  on her piano.  Listen, feel... and experience the love she expresses in her  music!  I VERY highly recommend this album. If you listen with someone you  like very much, you will fall in love!  This album is pure magic!May 4th, 2011... after over ELEVEN years, I still feel the same about this beautiful album!  Wish I could go back to the day I originally posted the above paragraph! I happened to find this tape at a used clothing/furniture/bric-a-brac store.  I can't imagine who would ever give this up.  I've been playing it in my car ever since.  Over and over again it brings me joy and serenity.  I'm so glad I found it and the wonderful world of Suzanne Ciani's music.  I  just can't decide which C.D. to buy. I've been a fan of Suzanne ciani for years now... I actually bought thus to replace my old one!!!!! I play it for my 5 month old daughter at nap time too :) I am a seminary student and I was looking for some good music to listen to while I was reading. I came accross Suzanne Ciani and she is great! This CD is amazing! I bought this tape years ago &amp; was overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of Ms. Chiani's music.  I have come back to now buy the cd as the tape is getting a bit worn out.  While the sound bits chosen as samples are wonderful songs, the others on the cd (most notably, neverland &amp; tuscany) are just as or even more beautiful. This is definitely &quot;ocean music&quot;, at least to my ears.  I can hear Suzanne Cianti's expression of her feeling for the depths and the breadth of the ocean, for the calm moments and for the stormy moments.Calling this music &quot;new-age&quot; is confining it.  Yes, it is new-age, and the pianist takes advantage of the freedom from classical form that the genre affords.  But it goes beyond that, and many who generally have no interest in what they call &quot;new age&quot; may well enjoy this.  This lady definitely has the classical knowledge and knows technically what she is doing, and the effect is, to me, breathtaking.Each piece here has a definite individuality.  (That's not always true in new age.)  Such cuts as &quot;Ondine&quot;, &quot;Italia&quot;, &quot;Hotel Luna&quot;, &quot;Mozart&quot;, and &quot;The Velocity of Love&quot; stand out for me.I always bear in mind that not everyone likes what I like.  However, in this case, it seems to me that if you enjoy evocations of the sea; if you enjoy classically flavored new age;  if you enjoy the piano played in a manner that ranges from the intimate to large scale; you will treasure this CD and, like me, consider buying some of her previous albums. I 1st listened to this CD in the mist of a very stressfull & depressed time in my life, and WOW!!! I as completly taken awayI was calmed before the 4th track this CD is so relaxing and soothing with a sence of serinity in the mix.and I have listened to this many,many a nite with dim lighting.after a hard day.prior to the close of the day....and by the way, TRY LISTENING TO IT ALL SNUGGLED AND EMBRACED WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE.Oh what a pleasure that is!!! I give both this vendor and the item high marks........the product came on time, at a great price point, and I am enjoying it! If you love a cross between new age and light classical music, then this is the CD for you!! Suzanne does a outstanding job with her weaving of light synthesizers and piano and all tracks of this CD are a listener's delight! This CD is like finding a buried treasure that you didn't know existed, it's a MUST have for anyone who appreciates music to relax or set a special mood! Once you have heard this gem you will listen again and again and will want to have this in the car to relax when on a stressful commute, or to have at home to unwind after a long day. Suzanne's masterful blend of piano, synthesizers, and light percussions make this a treat for all to hear. Once you listen to this you will want to listen every chance you get!","Instrumental,Progressive,Electronic,Jazz,Pop,New Age,Rock,Meditation,Adult Alternative",days dick clark ill give wash car seems translate ill give use focus chakras world needs meandering fluffy stuff lacks substance direction form perfect example people absolutely despise much new age thats want relax meditate whatever activity need sort sonic wallpaper background means buy cd basically worse better ton stuff thats matter put tape sound ocean waves crashing however actually intend listen going serve background activity suggest look elsewhere want stick new age genre humbly offer suggestions means complete list jumping spots liz storygeorge winstonpaul winter especially common days dick dick clark ill wash car seems translate ill focus chakras world needs meandering fluffy stuff lacks substance direction form perfect example people absolutely despise new age want relax meditate activity need sort sonic wallpaper background means buy cd basically worse better ton stuff matter tape sound ocean ocean waves waves crashing actually intend listen serve background activity suggest look want stick new new age genre age genre humbly offer suggestions means complete list jumping spots winter especially common
27,46,B0000000L6,"&quot;The Private Music of Tangerine Dream&quot; is the most recent new age album I've bought. I like the music because it's electronic and it's fast. I don't really like the slow ambient music like the stuff that Steve Roach plays. I have two of his albums: streams and currents and dreamtime return but I donb't listen to them much. The only other Tangerine album I own is &quot;Canyon Dreams&quot; but since I like Tangerine Dream's music and I don't know much about them, I decided to get this album.The highlights on this album are: melrose, too hot for my chinchilla, after the call and electric lion. But if you enjoy electronic music, you should enjoy listening to the whole album.I recommend this to every new age listener. Tangerine Dream has a wealth of repackaging of  releases that it can be puzzling and oftentimes quite puzzling to fans or those wanting to hear the group for the first time. This collection, though, actually makes sense.The album focuses on 1988-1990, when the group found a home on Peter Baumann's Private Music label, which was located on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. Though it leans heavily on the album entitled Melrose, there is a flow to the numbers that brings a new focus to this period of the band's lengthy career.This is a great walk down Melrose Avenue, as a former band member gave the group the flexibility to focus on the art of creating music. There are different kinds of fans of Tangerine Dream music, so to understand my reviews, you must understand my tastes. I prefer their later works, with songs that are harmonious, rhythmic, lyrical, and  &quot;pretty.&quot; Their first excellent album for me was Underwater  Sunlight. You might find (by reading lots of reviews) that the people who  love TDream's early work dislike the later albums; people who like the  later albums don't like the early stuff. I am the 2nd type. Of my 22 or so  TDream albums so far, the greatest ones (in approximate order) are: Le  Parc, Underwater Sunlight, Architecture in Motion, Private Music, Goblins'  Club, Optical Race, Melrose, Lily on the Beach. OK albums are: Tang-go,  Force Majeure, Exit. Unpleasant albums are: Turn of the Tides, Rockoon,  Stratosfear, Phaedra, Atem, Alpha Centauri, Elect. Meditation, or anything  else pre '83. The Private Music of Tangerine Dream is an interesting  compilation. It mostly comes from Melrose, Optical Race, and Lily on the  Beach. All tracks are good - Atlas Eyes is best. For new listeners of  TDream, this is a wonderful intro album into their later music style - the  songs have very wide audience appeal (your mom might even like it). TDream  fans who share my tastes MUST try out Patrick O'Hearn. I'm 43 and I remember the day I started listening to Tangerine Dream. I mean,even the name was weird but that's exactly what made it appealing and I have not stopped listening to this band for the last 16 years. I use it to MEDITATE every morning and to find ways to grow spiritually. Also,it's an awesome instrument to project your goals onto a tangible prism. I will keep it short, just wanted to express my gratitude to this band and I will listen to them or their music for a very long time,specially the MELROSE  C.D.Thanks to ALL.Efren Miotto This was the first album of tangerine dream that I ever heard,and I was HOOKED!It must have been around 1996 or so. Loved it then, love it now. When my son broke my TAPE of this recording I almost died! To find it here, what a joy, WHAT A FIND.!!!! This cd was exactly as described. Played great, excellent price and arrived sooner than expected. What else can you ask for? The Private Music of Tangerine Dream is a pretty good compilation of songs from the Melrose years (with tracks from Melrose, Lily on the Beach, and Optical Race + one track from Miracle Mile and two bonus tacks) released by Private Music (one of the TD recording labels) in 1992. For a casual TD listener like myself (not quite an avid fan) buying this makes sense as it contains quite a few TD gems: Melrose, Too Hot for My ChinChilla, Sun Gate, Rolling Down Cahuenga, Electric Lion, etc. and the previously unreleased Roaring of the Bliss which I find quite exceptional. However, for the avid fan or someone who already has most of their studio/live albums, this compilation may be a bit redundant.On to the technical: the CD I got here (original issue - Private Label, 1992) is well recorded, and in line with some of the best I've heard in terms of early '90s recordings and in general. The signal peaks on average at 90dB (-6dB VU) so there is plenty of headroom left for the occasional signal spike, there is no clipping, no obvious digital artifacts save for some occasional harshness in the upper frequencies on some tracks but only ever so slightly. All in all, from my perspective, a great buy - 5 star. There are endless numbers of 'Best of Tangerine Dream' collections;  selecting between them is often difficult and invariably confusing. It is  not helped by the fact that the band has had contracts with so many  different record companies over the years, and each label naturally feels  it is necessary to keep repackaging THEIR material as the best!BMG  continues to hold rights to the band's output released originally on the  Private Music label from 1988 thru 1990. This covers the three mainstream  albums &quot;Optical Race&quot;, &quot;Lily on the Beach&quot; and  &quot;Melrose&quot;, as well as the soundtrack from the film, &quot;Miracle  Mile&quot;.  The compilation album, &quot;The Private Music of Tangerine  Dream&quot;, presents just over half of one of these albums -  &quot;Melrose&quot; - together with a couple of token tracks from each of  the others. It also manages to include some 9-minutes-worth of material  previously unavailable on official releases.Just to make things really  awkward, Tangerine Dream's own record company, TDI, have re-acquired the  rights to &quot;Optical Race&quot;, &quot;Lily on the Beach&quot; and  &quot;Melrose&quot; and have produced their own compilations from those  (together with four other albums of the early 90's), in the form of  &quot;Atlantic Bridges&quot; and &quot;Atlantic Walls&quot;! Either of  those two presents a rather better collection of songs than you'll find  assembled here. And between them, the &quot;Atlantic...&quot; compilations  duplicate a good two-thirds of this one, so I can't see how anyone really  needs this too! Add in the fact that &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; is  represented here in the form of a single 5-minuter ('After the Call') which  sits rather badly amidst the rest, one is left thinking that the only  remaining incentive for buying this disc is the presence of the two new  tracks.Naturally, you'll have to decide for yourself how badly you want  these, but my view is that they in no way make this a viable purchase. Both  are under 5 minutes in length and offer little of any worth. They give the  impression of being unfinished sketches for tracks cut from other albums.  'Beaver Town' is the lighter of two, being little more than a jazzy, jangly  synth line over a pop percussion track. 'Roaring of the Bliss' is little  better, sounding like an early sketch for something from &quot;The Dream  Mixes&quot;. It features a synthetic piano pulse, organ wash and drums  driving a heavy dance beat. In any case, it is surely only a matter of time  before the band re-release these two numbers on one of their own archive  editions - heck, they're dragging out everything else - and so, ultimately,  this disc is really only for the most ardent of TD-completionists! To my  mind, normal people may prefer to buy &quot;Optical Race&quot; and  &quot;Lily of the Beach&quot; (and &quot;Miracle Mile&quot;, perhaps) and  leave it at that! Or just go for one (or both!) of the  &quot;Atlantic...&quot; pair. &quot;Private Music&quot; is a collection of Tangerine Dream's best material from the &quot;Melrose Years&quot; during which they incorporated the talents of both Paul Haslinger and Edgar Froese's son, Jerome.  Thus,  the album is an extremely polished series of compositions, and I can't say  there is a song on it that I find distasteful.  I am especially fond of  &quot;Atlas Eyes&quot;, &quot;Sun Gate&quot;, Too Hot For My  Chinchilla&quot;, and &quot;Roaring Bliss&quot;. Fans of earlier Tangerine  Dream may find this album to their disliking, primarily because these songs  do not retain the length and &quot;space-like&quot; quality that earlier  material does.  Despite this fact, I have highly enjoyed this album, and it  seems to age very well.

28,47,B0000000LE,"This CD is fabulous - It has a  Taj Mahal's style of the blues written all over it- I especially love the remake of ""Sugar Pie Honey Bun"".  Taj's style gets you moving and feeling the blues - but in a happy WAY! I find listening to this CD a motivational moving thing! I definitely recommend this CD for your blues collection! One of the best blues albums I've ever heard...keep it in my car and play it everyday THIS CD IS SUPERB, DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD YOU EXPERIENCE MOVES YOU DIDN,T THANK YOU HAD . EXCELLENT DANCE SONGS WITH THAT BOOGIE BACK GROUND VERY HARD TO BEAT. Dancing the Blues is one of my very favorite CD's by one of my very favorite artists Taj Mahal.  It's great to listen to, great to dance to and every song is a living thing.I first saw Taj Mahal in 1972 and was blown away by his performance and command and knowledge of the music that he played and sang. since then I have been lucky enough to see him two other times, on each occasion I received an education in the music as well as having an all out good time.Dancing the Blues represents the energy, love and respect which Taj has for music.  There is a wide range of music from the motown sounds of Taj's excellent version of the four top's &quot;Sugarpie Honeybunch&quot; (oh no I'm in junior high again)to Chester (the wolf) Burnett' &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot;.  I love Taj's version of Mockingbird, with the help of Etta James - there is nothing like it - I could listen to it again and again.This is an album I strongly recommend for anyone who loves the blues. This CD ranges from smokin' blues to tight sexy grooves to pure soul to old fashioned boogie woogie. Taj proves once again to master whatever style he wants to play. Buy it, load it and crank it up. Your neighbors are gonna  love it ;-) I bought this CD as a birthday gift, for a blues die-hard..He really enjoys the CD..I purchased this, and had it shipped to another address. It got there early, with no problems. Admittedly, I'm a ""Taj Mahal-ic"" with no desire to be cured of my addiction.I still own his very first album on LP and I've seen him perform live morethan any other entertainer. So I was thrilled to see this collection reappearon CD (with Taj's take on the 4 Tops' Motown nugget, ""I Can't Help Myself."")This is the perfect soundtrack for a blues (or any other type) party-- it startswith the booty-shaking ""Blues Ain't Nothin'"" and plays its way through jitterbug,second line and cheek-to-cheek dance grooves, paying homage to blues and R&B; masters such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Fats Domino and Hank Ballard alongthe way. His duet with Etta James on ""Mockingbird"" is an absolute joy. If you'rebuying the CD, order two-- one for a friend-- that's what I did! This is a fantastic collection of well-chosen cover tunes as well as originals. They range from the energetic workout, &quot;Hoochi Coochi Coo&quot; to slow blues such as &quot;That's How Strong My Love Is&quot;  &amp; &quot;Going to the River&quot;. The presence of the Texacali Horns  throughout the album give it a distinct 50's feel. Etta James joins Taj for  a great version of &quot;Mockingbird&quot;. There's not a weak track here.  Great blues, lots of fun! Great interpretations of choice material, an absolutely crack band. love the horns. Similar in nature to Phantom Blues and Senor Blues THIS CD ARRIVED PROMPT AND IN GOOD SHAPE. SO GLAD I TOOK A CHANCE WITH IT. I ONLY KNEW ONE SONG BEOFRE I BOUGHT IT, AND FOUND OUT MOCKING BIRD WAS ON IT AS WELL. GREAT MUSIC, PUTS YOU IN A GOOD MOOD WITH THE FIRST SONG. taj&amp;crew are grooving on this great disc.the songs are giving a fine touch by Taj.i've always enjoyed his guitar playing and the different styles of music that he brings into his thing. Taj Mahal recorded this in 1993 - I bought the CD in 2001 and am still listening to it. Here Taj Mahal takes on pre 1970 rhythm and blues. He does a wonderful  duet of Mockingbird with Etta James. Fantastic CD. Taj Mahal always makes good albums, and this is no exception. Not great, but consistently good throughout. Can't go wrong.","Classic Country,Contemporary Folk,Country,Pop,Traditional Folk,Electric Blues,Traditional Blues,Contemporary Blues,Blues,Folk",cd fabulous taj mahals style blues written especially love remake sugar pie honey bun tajs style gets moving feeling blues happy way find listening cd motivational moving thing definitely recommend cd blues collection one best blues ive ever heard keep car play everyday cd superb driving road experience moves thank excellent dance boogie back ground hard beat dancing blues one favorite cds one favorite artists taj mahal great listen great dance every living thing first saw taj mahal blown away performance command knowledge played sang since lucky enough see two times occasion received education well good time cd fabulous taj mahals style blues written especially love remake sugar sugar pie pie honey honey bun bun tajs style feeling blues happy way find listening cd motivational definitely recommend cd blues collection best blues heard keep car play everyday cd superb driving road experience thank excellent dance boogie ground hard beat dancing blues favorite cds favorite artists great listen great dance living saw taj blown blown away away performance command knowledge played sang lucky see times occasion received education good good time time
29,48,B0000000LG,"The bluesy, mellow voice of Etta James is just what you need on a rainy day cooking in the kitchen. That question about being trapped on an island and only having one CD: This is it. I've all but worshiped Billie Holiday for a long time, but as hard as it is to admit, Etta may well have bested Lady Day here. In her voice, strength, courage, fragility, and tenderness all come through at the same time. Not muddling, but feeding off one another. She brings depth to these timeless songs that even the great Holiday seldom delivered.&quot;Ghost of a Chance&quot; left me trembling. &quot;How Deep is the Ocean&quot; has never been deeper. And this is by far the best interpretation of  &quot;I'll Be Seeing You&quot; ever recorded...in my less than humble opinion. Do yourself a favor and buy it today. Etta at the top of her game, songs are amazing.  Quality arrangements and sound. If you are a fan of jazz this one is a must have. Just how does one cover Billie Holiday? In this case, brilliantly. This has been one of my favorite albums for going on 15 years now. This is not a record you would expect from Etta James, but things worked out just fine.Sophisticated, elegant, soulful and timeless. It has few peers for late-night listening. Absolutely loved it! Great choice of songs and Etta James was the best! I would highly recommend it if you liked Etta James. Etta James is as good a blues singer as there is .  I would recommend this CD to friends with the same feelings about the Blues. VERY FINE TRIBUTE ALBUM BY ETTA JAMES SINGING SONGS MADE FAMOUS BY BILLIE HOLIDAY.  IRONICALLY, THIS WAS HER FIRST GRAMMY, SINGING SOMEONE ELSE'S MUSIC, AFTER ALL OF THE CLASSIC RECORDINGS SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY MADE OVER THE YEARS. WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS CD IS THAT IT STILL SOUNDS LIKE ETTA JAMES, NOT SOMEONE IMITATING BILLIE HOLIDAY. GREAT ARRANGEMENTS AND BACKUP, TOO. FINE INTERPRETATIONS OF ONE GREAT ARTIST PAYING TRIBUTE TO ANOTHER ONE. I don't want the cat or the children to get ahold of this. I don't want it  to accidently be knocked over and ruined. I handle it with the care a  mother has for her newborn child. It's kept under lock and key! This is a wonderful CD, one of Etta's very best.  But do NOT buy ""At Last (The Best of Etta James""), produced in 2011. That CD is terrible...The difference between the two CDs is unbelievable! Love this cd added it to my collection of music. Have several of her cd and love them all. She can sing anything from jazz to blues ! Very simply put this recording of some of Lady Day's music is sublime! Ms James has very strong memories of her mother listening to this music and the emotion that comes through is very deep and evocative of those memories! She is mostly associated with her ""hits"" on the Chess label and she of course had her struggles throughout her life, but she has also emerged at various points of her career with strong outings and this is indeed one of them! I never seem to get enough of Etta James, and her ability to surprise and please me as a listener of her Music.Mystery Lady is a Title that should apply to her and her performances that please her audiences Perfect song collection for remembering the good times and those loved ones past and present.  The perfect gift for friends who have been supportive and generously shown their love. I am finally adding this CD to my CD collection.  I bought this many years ago on cassette tape and I am thrilled that I can put this on my ipod.  Just buy this CD.  You cannot go wrong with Etta James especially her singing Billie Holiday!!  Can't get any better than that.  Highly recommend.  Enjoy!! I enjoy Etta James but if you are making a decision between this and the Argo/Chess material; the Argo/Chess sessions showcase Etta James at her prime. Very good CD! Good Amazon shipping system. Shipped via UPS. There was no update on shipment on Amazon for a couple of days so I called UPS. They knew nothing about it and said they did not even receive the package to begin the shipping process. A few hours later, information was updated on Amazon and the package showed up... Imagine that, UPS? Thank you Amazon! I work for a hospice company and while visiting a patient I heard this playing. It relaxes you and just chills me out. I find this a very soothing album. In 1995 I jumped into the backseat of a car.  This CD was playing.  Lady in the front seat asks the driver who was singing.  He replies ""that's Etta James.""  She says ""Damn, that's Etta?  Yeah, that's back when you heard a woman singing and you knew who was doing the singing.""I bought the CD that very night and have been listening to it constantly from that point on.  Even if you're not a Billie Holiday fan or for that matter, an Etta James fan, this one is just a must-have.  You won't stop listening. There is no one like the original Etta James. Knowing her life and all the tragedy in it her songs echo her soul. Thank you Etta for telling your story so beautifully. ETTA James Sounds Fantastic on Her Remakes of Billie Holiday's SOngs.The Arrangements,Production&amp;most Importantly the Voice all work Reallt Strongly here.Very Essential. I must say this is my favorite CD. Etta's voice coupled with terific songs  makes for a very pleasant, relaxing experience. All tracks were excellent. I was surprised that I would love this CD so much because I had heard of Etta James but I didn't know to much about her or her music (she was a little before my time).  I have to say this CD is timeless.  I love the words of the songs and the richness of her voice.  Etta truly makes me wish I could have been around to hear Billie do the honors herself. Etta james finally wona  Grammy for this album which is shocking cause hello she's etta james what in the world took the grammy's so long...this is a great cd ..that has a living legend pay tribute to another departed legend of jazz Billy holiday..her range is incredible...considering she is a true barritone...amazing...one of her best albums.. 'Ya heard?  I'm'a make this as short as possible.  Etta James has one'a the mos' passionate an' wrenching voices in all blues n' soul music an' when she takes on THESE numbers, you hear that an' them some.  As a big fan'a Billie Holiday not many singer could give much credibility to performin' the songs that she made famous.  But this jus' works.  Ms. James, rather than adopting the ballads with her own style, jus' adopted a DIFFERENT style than she normally does so that she can sing 'The Man I Love', 'Embraceable You', an' 'The Very Thought of You' with all the relaxed subtlety that Lady Day did.  With a nice jazz backing section, she lays the loveliness on thick.  Strictly fans'a her work only may not be as enthralled by this set, but if your musical tastes cover the whole spectrum from blues to soul to this ol' traditional-style jazz, then definitely check this out.  This is one'a the most earnest, sincere, an' well-done tribute albums of all time.  Ms. Billie would be proud. Being a big Billie Holiday fan, I admit to listening to this CD with some skepticism.  There have been many Billie tribute CD's over the years, few ever equalling her soulfulness and artistry, but after listening to this CD, Etta really opens my eyes and ears.  I wouldn't expect someone primarily known as a soul-R&amp;B singer to nail down these songs in an entirely new blues-soul context yet retaining its jazz structure.  She doesn't really have Billie's fragility of phrasing, but shows the same X factor of emotional and gut-wrenching elements in her interpretations, though on a grander scale.  She adds some of her ever-present feistiness as well, which of course Billie never had, but it never detracts from the jazz feel of this CD.  Feistiness is, after all, what makes her Etta James.  She shows remarkable restraint when she needs to be in this jazz context.  Congrats to a brave Etta in tackling these songs so identified with Billie.  You pulled it off, girl! I was always liked Etta's, A Sunday Kind of Love, so I was checking Amazon for CD's by her. I sure picked a great one. Mystery Lady is my favorite CD. I play it almost everyday. Her voice is so clear and strong. I recommend it to everyone. I am not completely convinced with this, for many reasons.Billie Holiday was an artist capable of expressing happiness and sadness - in her short life she had recorded some amazingly happy, bouncy swinging songs and later some devastatingly sad material, covering the whole gamut of human's experiences. On the other hand, Etta James was a blues/R&B; shouter known for her soulful growling and though she did occasionally reach out into old ""songbook"" repertoire (after all, her biggest hit ""At Last"" was ancient 1930s ballad updated for R&B; market) she would rely on rhythm and shouting to get the point. The only connecting link between these two singers is actually Etta James's mother who was big fan and played her recordings at home when young girl was growing up. So now, decades later, Etta is paying tribute to both women on album of late-night ballads focused entirely on heartbreak. Obviously that was Billie Holiday for her. Very one-sided. Like Billie never sung happy note in her life. The album was actually big success and got her ""Grammy"" (and side-lined her career into several similar albums) but I don't care much for this - Etta James sounds old,tired and weary - perhaps the biggest surprise was the fact that she actually toned down her typical growling for a moment. It's not a pleasant listening (despite fine music background) and it bothers me to see how people perceive Billie Holiday as only and exclusively sad, destroyed woman when in fact I know and love many of her uptempo music. Billie was NOT a victim, she was a strong woman who enjoyed life, smoked, drank and had a fist-fights when inspired - the fact that this album focuses only on sad ballads from her repertoire is like if Hollywood makes movie about your life and describes you only in very basic terms,like the street where you lived and supermarket where you bought your food but leaves out everything else. Come to think of it, it already happen when Hollywood made movie about Billie's life and just mangled everything. People who knew Billie were actually very upset.If you want to hear really good Billie Holiday tribute check out albums with similar albums by Anita O'Day and Carmen McRae. The blend between Etta James and Billie Holiday makes this album sensuous  and hot.  Etta James' voice is sultry and expresses the exhilaration,  passion and pain of being in love.  Like life, love is complex and full of  surprises. I kept trying to identify which song I liked the best.  They are  all great.  It felt like a massage for my soul and made my heart smile. My wife and I both love this album, and were delighted to find it.  We love Etta James' R&B classics, but we also really enjoy good interpretations of standards, and these renditions are magical.  She reveals herself as a musical soul with great range.  The arrangements support her very well.","R&B,Blues,Soul,Pop,Vocal Blues",bluesy mellow voice etta james need rainy day cooking kitchen question trapped island one cd ive worshiped billie holiday long time hard admit etta may well bested lady day voice strength courage fragility tenderness come time muddling feeding one another brings depth timeless even great holiday seldom delivered quot ghost chance quot left trembling quot deep ocean quot never deeper far best interpretation quot ill seeing quot ever recorded less humble opinion favor buy today etta top game amazing quality arrangements sound fan jazz one must one cover billie holiday case brilliantly one favorite alb bluesy mellow voice etta need rainy rainy day day cooking kitchen question trapped island island one cd worshiped billie holiday holiday long long time time hard admit etta etta may bested lady lady day day voice strength courage fragility tenderness come time muddling feeding brings depth timeless great holiday seldom delivered quot ghost chance quot left trembling quot deep deep ocean ocean quot far best interpretation quot ill seeing quot recorded humble opinion favor buy today etta top game game amazing quality arrangements sound fan jazz cover billie holiday holiday case brilliantly favorite alb
30,49,B0000000LO,"A superb album from Toots with the cream of west coast and east coast musicians supporting and joining in the beautiful cascade of classic jazz tunes.  I bought this album when it was released and somehow it disappeared from my collection so I bought it again 'cus it's such an auditory delight! 4.5 starsA glorious record full of memorable jams with many fine players, all centered around the genius that is Toots T.This is jazz sounding very unlike most other jazz, at least when Toots is playing. From swing to bop to fusion to trad, Toots makes all his guests here bring their A-game, as he never brings anything less than A+. He gets so much more music and feeling out of the harmonica than anyone else who has ever played it; hell, he plays more music than almost any other musician, period.The man is deep and eloquent and passionately committed to every phrase he lets float into the ether. And it's all so lyrical. There are moments of real magic here. His take on Evans' classics Waltz For Debby and Blue In Green are two of the many highlights. Bird played at speed on harmonica? Times two! Sco, Robben, McBride, Mays, Erskine, and the rest have their work cut out for them keeping up, and this ends up being one of the most unique and musical jazz records in my collection.Highly recommended. Toots Thielemans has been the absolute undisputed master of the Jazz harmonica since the 1950's.  The harmonica, normally shunned by mainstream music fans, becomes an instrument capable of tremendous power and beauty in the hands of Toots.  This CD is an excellent example of why critics can look past their prejudices towards the instrument when they listen to Toots.This album is half East Coast Jazz and half West Coast.  one half is rawer, more be-bop, the other half is cooler, more subtle.  If I were to be asked to give examples of either style, I would use this outstanding recording as a primer.  Toots has lined up a great group of musicians to play with and the songs are well arranged and executed.I definitely recommend that you add this album to your collection. I only write a review when something comes along that just blows my head off. This album has done so.  Mr. Thieleman's playing is stunning, creamy, soulful.  The inflection that he can wring from this instrument boggles me.  No other instrument can do what he's doing here.  Why don't we hear more of this? Beats me. Maybe Toots is the only one who has figured out how.  In addition to his playing, the lineup of songs is strong, not a bad one in the bunch.  The recording quality is excellent.  And the backup musicians are all-star, to wit: Charlie Haden on bass, Peter Erskine on drums, Terrance Blanchard, who does a great job, Ernie Watts on sax, Allen Broadbent on Piano, and one of my favs, Lyle Mays on piano, who does not get out enough (and others not mentioned).  I will be dedicating myself to beefing up my collection of Toots for the foreseeable future.","Brazil,Swing Jazz,Jazz,South & Central America,Latin Pop,Brazilian Jazz,Latin Music,Pop,World Music,Bebop,Latin Jazz",superb toots cream west coast east coast musicians supporting joining beautiful cascade classic jazz tunes bought released somehow disappeared collection bought cus auditory delight starsa glorious record full memorable jams many fine players centered around genius toots jazz sounding unlike jazz least toots playing swing bop fusion trad toots makes guests bring game never brings anything less gets much feeling harmonica anyone else ever played hell plays almost musician period man deep eloquent passionately committed every phrase lets float ether lyrical moments real magic take evans classics waltz debby blue green superb toots cream coast east coast musicians supporting joining beautiful cascade cascade classic classic jazz tunes bought released disappeared collection bought cus auditory delight glorious record full memorable jams fine players centered genius toots jazz sounding jazz toots playing swing bop fusion trad toots guests bring game brings feeling harmonica played hell plays musician period man deep eloquent passionately committed phrase lets float ether lyrical moments real magic evans classics waltz debby blue blue green green
31,50,B0000000LQ,"Like several other reviewers, I became a Kenny Rankin fan with Silver Morning in 1976.  At that time I was more of a fan of singer/songwriters like James Taylor and Joni Mitchell.  But then my tastes stared to expand into jazz with singers like Michael Franks, then Bobby McFerrin, and now Diana Krall.  I developed a taste for the jazz ""standards"" from the tin pan alley days.  So I put Kenny aside.With the release of this album (dedictated to his mother) he took a crack at the standards.  And what a crack it is.  I'd give my left arm to be able to sing like Kenny.  Since I can't I'm happy to plop play his CD and kick back.  His is a warm voice that envelopes you.  It's warm, with an incredible range, and incredibly melodic.  This is music for jazz vocal fans! The cd was sent in an appropriate manner and timely.  I have used this as a gift.  Great CD. Once again (see Tom Rush's ""Tom Rush"") I'm compelled to review an album that needs no further review.  ...I've been listening to Kenny since Like A Seed.  And I've been listening to this album all weekend.  It's on now (You smiled at me, baby, then the spell was cast).  I've owned it since it came out.If you enjoy jazz, vocals, good music, outstanding piano, bass, sax and a little trombone thrown in to boot, then just put this on and sit back.  You are in for a real treat.And if you happen to be a bass fan, you might just be blown away by Brian Bromberg's work on this CD -- starting with his OUTSTANDING rendering on the very first track.And as for underrated vocal artists, how about Sue Raney, who teams with Kenny for a superb duet on I've Got A Crush On You?Cole Porter, Ray Noble, George and Ira G., Jule Styne, Sammy Cahn, Billy Rose, Gus Kahn, Harry Warren, Mack Gordon, Oscar Levant, Alan Brandt, Bob Haymes -- they are all here and all are, I'm quite sure, quite pleased with Kenny's treatment of their work.  Folks, THIS is as good as it gets.Indeed, Kenny's own solo contribution is a welcome treat here.  Beautifully poignant and beautifully done....5 BIG stars for one of the best male vocalists of all time at the very top of his game.And that's MY opinion.Okay?Double exclamation point !! This album doesn't miss in any way. Kenny Rankin was one of the greatest and all his colleagues agreed. These songs are pure heaven! I received my order very quickly and absolutely love this Kenny Rankin CD. It's such a shame we lost him way too early Kenny Rankin is one of our most underated artists!  He has been around for about 30 years and is certainly fairly well known, but he should be a superstar.  His arrangements on this album are utterly outstanding.  &quot;The Very Thought Of You&quot;, &quot;Blame It On My Youth&quot;,  &quot;You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To&quot;, &quot;Margo's Song&quot;, as  well as every other song on this album are gems.The standards are  given wonderful jazz arrangements.  The only thing missing is Rankin's own  outstanding guitar work.  He had injured his hand and could not play guitar  for quite a while. The combo behind him is terrific, however.If you  love great standards, buy this album! This is a wonderful CD.  One of my all time favorites. If you like nice, mellow, jazzy, romantic music this the CD for you. Buy it!  You won't be disappointed. I'm a long time fan of Kenny Rankin... I was at his last concert.  I've been listening since the 60's...  He is deeply missed but the music he left us will remain forever.  I didn't have this CD and it's really different from the usual Kenny Rankin....  I recently found a 24 bit recording and the clarity is wonderful  &#34;Because of You&#34; Album...  if you can find this one - you won't be disappointed.  I am also happy to say that at his last concert I had the pleasure to meet him in the Lobby after his performance. I have been a Kenny Rankin fan for a long time. Longer than either of us would like to hear about. He was asked to do an album of tunes like this by a person that none of us can hardly ever say ""NO"" to his Mom! She is the one that comes from that erea of soft dreamy sounds. He did this album of old classics his way and knocked it out of the park.  Great voice, great album great buy! ""These are but a few of the songs my mother always told me. They are my wish list. I love these songs. But they are not mine. They belong to you."" ~ Kenny Rankin ~""I've enjoyed Kenny's friendship for many, many years. His spirit is wild and tender, impulsive and romantic - and these songs have a tremendous richness and purity. We felt that by approaching them simply, we'll create room for Kenny's expression to soar. It's a pleasure to hear his heart sing."" ~ Hank Cicalo ~This CD, Kenny Rankin's ""Professional Dreamer"" is one great collection of beautiful songs from the Great American Songbook - thirteen of the loveliest standards for your ears only! The choice of material is simply perfect and the arrangements by the artist himself with his creative pianists, Alan Broadbent and Mike Wafford are simply outstanding and they are some of the best arrangements for these time-tested songs. Kenny Rankin gives these evergreens ""fresh-as-a-daisy"" interpretations with his stylish and one-of-a-kind vocal artistry.Each song tells a story of love and romance and each is rendered in a manner so fabulous with Mr. Rankin's sincere, dedicated and heartfelt readings of the lyrics. His music has always been pleasant to listen to. How can you not love this CD when all the songs here are innate expressions of Mr. Rankin's magnificent creativity starting off with a Cole Porter gem, ""You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To"" to the final track, a very nice, meaningful and my all-time favorite song by Alan Brandt and Bob Haymes, ""That's All.""It's so delectable listening to this CD in its entirety for every song is a winner and there's nothing to whine about. I'm very pleased with the choice of material - they are my all-time favorites. Imagine ""I've Got A Crush On You"" sung in the most entrancing way with Sue Raney, a singer with a glowing voice. It's one of the most beguiling versions I could think of.You'll surely fall in love with this album. So listen now ... and have a lovely listening experience.P.S. You may also want to check his other notable CDs out -Kenny Rankin Album,Because of You,After the Roses,Bottom Line Encore Collection,Haven't We Met?andSong for Youfor more enchanting listens. Recorded in honor of his mom, these songs are out of the past, but fit so well in Rankin's unique style, like smooth flowing waterfall!Romantic, soothing jazz done with flair and stylistic touches that make Rankin so unique.  I agree with the others, this guy should be more popular.  Maybe we can help. Kenny Rankin sings the jazz of rainy Sundays by an open fire.His intimate and highly personal style is no better exemplified than on this set, ""Professional Dreamer"".In many ways it's a departure from his usual repertoire as it consists entirely of classics from the 1940s and 50s.These offerings reflect the musical values of another era - elegant and genteel songs from a time when melody lines were strong and lyrics dripped with intelligent emotion.These compositions lend themselves perfectly to Rankinesque interpretationThe standout cut ""But Not for Me"" ripples with a soft Latin undercurrent.Rankin's vocal improvisations are gentle and deliberate as they paint a soul-sad portrait of someone love has overlooked.Gershwin's beautiful ""Our Love is Here to Stay"" is another highlight of this very classy set.So too is the cheeky and whimsical ""I've Got a Crush on You"" and the ultra-evocative ""The Very Thought of You"".It's all exquisite grist for a very tender mill.An album for the ages - FIVE STARS for Kenny and the jazz of rainy Sundays. Kenny Rankin was a favorite when I was growing up - Pussywillow Cattails, When Sunny Gets Blue, On and On, Peaceful.  I basically identify my taste for music along his style together with Bacharach, the bossanova sound of Brazil until I discovered the Great American Composers.  My favorite songs were a handful and most of them are works by these songwriters or simply sang by singers I have admired.I was surprised to learn years later that he has resurrected and like Rod Stewart, Linda Rondstad, Carly Simon to name a few have recorded standard albums.  Kenny Rankin came out with solid numbers that are cornerstones in the Great Songbook Series like ""That's All"", ""The Very Thought of You"" and ""My One and Only Love"" which I think are the best in the album.  Even ""You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To"" - a piece that I usually I am not fond of came out with an excellent treatment.  Then, of course, came the other tracts the likes of ""But Not For Me"" and ""Our Love Is Here To Stay"" that somehow clouded the whole album as being too commonplace.Yes, he improvized and that's the redeeming part of it and somehow I was expecting his voice and style would mature over the years but somehow it didn't.  And that's the reason why I said ""It's Difficult"" as my title because I am caught between a sweet nostalgia and a flat reworking of these classics.BTW, my CD was personally autographed by Kenny in one of his concerts in Asia where he has a strong following.","Adult Contemporary,Oldies,Traditional Vocal Pop,Jazz,Vocal Jazz,Traditional Pop,Pop,Traditional Jazz & Ragtime,Broadway & Vocalists,Rock,Vocal Pop",like several reviewers became kenny rankin fan silver morning time fan singer songwriters like james taylor joni mitchell tastes stared expand jazz singers like michael franks bobby mcferrin diana krall developed taste jazz standards tin pan alley days put kenny aside release dedictated mother took crack standards crack id give left arm able sing like kenny since cant im happy plop play cd kick back warm voice envelopes warm incredible range incredibly melodic jazz vocal fans cd sent appropriate manner timely used gift great cd see tom rushs tom rush im compelled review needs review ive listening kenny since like seed ive listening like reviewers kenny rankin fan silver morning time time fan singer singer songwriters songwriters james taylor joni mitchell tastes stared expand jazz singers michael franks bobby mcferrin mcferrin diana krall developed taste jazz jazz standards standards tin tin pan alley pan alley days aside release mother crack standards crack left arm able sing happy plop play cd kick warm voice envelopes warm incredible range incredibly melodic jazz jazz vocal vocal fans cd sent appropriate manner timely used gift great cd see tom tom rushs rushs tom tom rush rush compelled review needs review listening seed listening
32,51,B0000000M0,"My friend made me listen to this CD and I have absolutely fallen in love with it.  It is excellent!  If you like acoustic music you will like this. It reminds me of DMB or Jack Johnson, sort of....really great.  Watercolor is fabulous! I had a Live From the World Cafe disc that contains a great stripped-down version of &quot;Angry Words&quot; which I really liked.On a hunch (which are usually pretty good), I went and purchased this album.  Bad  mistake. You should get this album just for ""Watercolor."" And right now with some of the used prices at under a dollar there is no reason you shouldn't give this a try. I'll agree that I like some of his other CDs better. But start here, buy the rest, and see him live if you can. You won't regret it. So many albums catch you and then fade into the back of your CD collection.  Willy Porter's songs initially generate a less passionate response, but, they grow and grow on you to the point where you are hooked forever.  In other words, they don't fade and instead blossom!  I read the couple negative reviews and can only conclude in this day of the need for immediacy, the negatives are too impatient to experience the long term magic of Willy P!  They have my sympathy.  For the rest, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy! I've seen Willy Porter for seven years live and his guitear playing is as good as any live singer song writer out there.  Innovating and sincere, he is a show not to miss. Willy Porter is a talented songwriter and guitarist that not enough people know about. He's as adept at creating a beautiful song that will move you as he is writing a clever and humorous tune that will make you snicker. And....he's very talented on the acoustic six-string. Dog Eared Dream is a very good album with a lot of great songs and performances. Since this was on a major label, the production is such that it sounds like it was designed to reach the burgeoning adult alternative market of the time. Not that this is a detriment but it's noticeable when you hear his later and rawer releases which are just as good if not better. The accompaniment is very strong throughout, a fretless bass here, some strings or Hammond B-3 there but it all works. As for the songs, ""Angry Words"" is one of his best and would bring Willy closest to the mainstream. Just as impressive are the joyous and melodic ""Glow"", the breezy ""Cool Water"", the hearfelt ""Cold Wind"", and the dreamy ballad ""Boab Tree"". His best song here and one of his fan favorites is ""Jesus on the Grille"", as witty a commentary on worship that you'll ever hear. The only track that I can't get into is ""Be Here Now"" and I feel if it was recorded more as a song rather than spoken word over music, it would have worked better. All told, Dog Eared Dream is a good introduction to this talented yet little known musician. Oh, and his live show is fantastic and definitely worth experiencing. About half the tracks are really good (espectially Rita, Angry Words, and Jesus on the Grille), and the rest are nothing much ... one or two I have to skip every time I listen to it (Boab Tree and Flying, for example).  A friend played only the good tracks for me (though I didn't know that, of course), I went and got the album, listened to it in its entirety, and realized it wasn't as good as I was expecting.  By the way, if you listen to his later albums, Willy has really cheesed out (he was heading that way on Dog-Eared Dream, but now it's just bad). Dog Eared Dream, Willy's second album, puts forth a facet of his music that is a highly polished gem.  Despite the production, the groovy life-blood of Willy's style can be heard moving through the veins of this  album.  Of special note are such songs as the popluar Angry Words, the  beautifull Watercolor, and the funky Be here now.  This album reflects the  more band-oriented side of Willy's music, while retaining his thoughtfull  lyrics, and most of his funk.  If you have heard him perform live and loved  it, this album may not be what you're looking for.  On the other hand, if  you are a fan looking to explore Willy Porter more fully, this is the  evolutionary step that got him out on the major touring circut and made him  a standard name among true music afficianados and midwest radio.  A solid  and excellent bit of work.  [...] ""Dog Eared Dream"" is Willy Porter's 2nd album, the follow-up to his first record, ""The Trees Have Soul."" I believe it was his first album released by a major record label, however. It is a mixed bag of brilliant songs and forgettable duds.This CD has quite a different feel from his first album. The all-out guitar virtuosity has been toned down significantly, only present in parts of a few songs. It is more produced and of a much higher recording quality, and it seems that Willy is turning more into a pop singer/songwriter than a fingerstylist with vocals, a shift that is sure to please some while irking others.The first song on the CD, ""Angry Words,"" is easily the best, and is perhaps the defining song of Willy's career. If that song had been what I like to call ""Vertical Horizoned"" (if you listen to the evolution of Vertical Horizon from their acoustic-based ""Running On Ice"" to their later albums, you'll understand what I mean), it would have easily been on the radio. Still, in its current state, it's a great song for the background of a party or while driving. It's also pretty cool that he uses two capos to play that song, but I digress. The next two songs, ""Rita"" and ""Jesus on the Grille"" show off Willy's country side. The former is a stronger song, driven by a sing-along-able chorus. The latter might be more fun live; it doesn't seem to be a very good studio track. ""Boab Tree"" is pleasant enough if played in the background, but another standout track, ""Watercolor,"" follows it and is one of Willy's best (certainly his best love song). ""Cool Water,"" which appeared on his first album, comes next. It is a bit more upbeat (has real drums) and sounds like it could have been pulled off of a Dave Matthews Band album, but it still sounds a bit empty in spots and could have used more production assistance (not likely, since that would mean it would have to make a third appearance on a subsequent album). The next song is definitely the album's weakest: ""Be Here Now."" Willy's spoken word vocals don't come across as musical. He also tried spoken word on the previous album with the song ""Lines of Age,"" but that song was saved by a soaring chorus that this song lacks. The four tracks that round out the CD are nice but forgettable, though ""Flying"" would satisfy the guitar jocks looking for some of the fingerstyle playing of the first album.Overall, ""Dog Eared Dream"" is a decent album with a few great tracks and a few others that could have used more work. I've given it 4 stars because most of the tracks are at least listenable (""Be Here Now"" being the exception), there are a few outstanding songs, and Willy took some chances and tried to evolve from his first album. Fans of light acoustic rock and adult contemporary would enjoy this CD. Two songs (three if you count the bonus &quot;Cool Water on the tape I bought) really caught my ear immediately.  The single &quot;Angry Words&quot; and &quot;Flying.&quot;  &quot;Angry Words&quot; is one of those songs that floored me the moment I heard it on the radio, and waited several tense minutes to hear who the heck was singing that song.  &quot;Flying&quot; is a little different, one of those acoustic masterpieces whose total lack of production shows how perfect a song can be all on its own.  Must have listened to this album 300 times. For me, listening to &quot;Dog Eared Dream&quot; is a little like seeing the movie version of a favorite novel. You know you are not going to be entirely satisfied because your experience with the material is so much broader than the more popular vehicle could possibly present.I had the great pleasure of performing with Willy in the early '90's, so I have an intimate knowledge of his superior virtuosity, pristine voice and artistic integrity. &quot;Dog Eared Dream&quot; delivers beautifully on material I was familliar with (&quot;Watercolor&quot;, &quot;Cool Water&quot;), provides fresh new gems (&quot;Angry Words&quot;, &quot;Boab Tree&quot;) and tosses in something for no discernable reason(&quot;Be Here Now&quot;), rather like a good screenplay adaptation of a classic book.On balance without prejudice, this is a strong offering that should expose many more people to the talent that is Willy Porter. A great cd.. angry words, the first cut was featured on the late great Leak Magazine sampler.  This is worth seeking out for the first cut alone.","Adult Contemporary,Contemporary Folk,Pop,Adult Alternative,Singer-Songwriters,Rock,Folk",friend made listen cd absolutely fallen love excellent like acoustic like reminds dmb jack johnson sort really great watercolor fabulous live world cafe disc contains great stripped version quot angry words quot really liked hunch usually pretty good went purchased bad mistake get watercolor right used prices dollar reason shouldnt give try ill agree like cds better start buy rest see live wont regret many catch fade back cd collection willy porters initially generate less passionate response grow grow point hooked forever words dont fade instead blossom read couple n friend listen cd absolutely fallen love excellent acoustic reminds dmb jack jack johnson sort really great watercolor fabulous live world cafe disc contains great stripped version quot angry words quot really liked hunch usually pretty good purchased bad mistake watercolor right used prices dollar reason try ill agree cds better start buy rest see live wont regret catch fade cd collection porters initially generate passionate response grow grow point hooked forever words fade instead blossom read couple

My 3 favorite Taj Mahal albums so far had been his first two (both released in the 60's) and &quot;Dancing the Blues.&quot;  I now have a 4th!  Get down! I'm a big big Taj fan.  Unfortunately, this album wasn't quite what I was expecting.  This is a considerable departure from a typical Taj blues album.  A couple good tracks though. i'm not a big fan of most contemporary blues singers, prefering that stuff they got goin' on in the mississip; pr'oly at best a 3anahalf-star rating, but seriously, Taj got that deep-from-some-gutter type sputter/growl goin' on and when he sings them love songs of his, it's some real hot stuff. &quot;here in the dark&quot;, &quot;fanning the flames&quot; and &quot;love her with a feeling&quot; are THE MOST SENSUALLY HOT BALLADS FROM ANY MALE ARTIST OUT THERE, R-N-B OR OTHERWISE! neo-soul cant e'en come close to the dirt and desire in those cuts! this is the artist that D'angelo will be inspired by 10 years from now. This is a great album,specially enriched with the marvellous participation of Jon Cleary,for me,one of the best piano players of ever.Really a participation of any Louisiana's piano player is a great thing for a good blues album!!!Specially some musicians like Jon Cleary,Dr.John,and Professor Longhair... This is a very true experience of this great bluesman,Taj Mahal,with guest appearances of Eric Clapton and Bonnie Raitt.I really loved the first track,an original of Taj's style.All of the others are pure Louisiana blues,and i really recomend to the bluesfans all over the world to listen this fantastic, Jon Cleary. He's a bluesman unrecognized,that deserves an accurated listened from those that really loves good music.You must try to listen the other Cleary's works such &quot;Alligator Lips and Dirty Rice&quot;  and recently &quot;Moonburn&quot;.What we can say is that Taj worked right to choose those great musicians and the results, are all inside this great cd!!! From the opning notes this album is great. I've been listening to it for 6+ years and it never bores me. Upbeat tracks, good horns and great guests (Clapton &amp; Raitt) I think this is an essential Taj pick. The back-up band is extreme. Players are exceptional. It's all good. These last nine words are really and truly unnecessary.","Country,Pop,Electric Blues,R&B,Contemporary R&B,Contemporary Blues,Blues",good shape used fast service bought cd one dance class like whole tape favorite taj mahal far first two released quot dancing blues quot th get im big big taj fan unfortunately wasnt quite expecting considerable departure typical taj blues couple good though im big fan contemporary blues singers prefering stuff got goin mississip proly best anahalf star rating seriously taj got deep gutter type sputter growl goin sings love real hot stuff quot dark quot quot fanning flames quot quot love feeling quot sensually hot ballads male artist r n b otherwise neo soul cant een come close dirt desire cuts artist dangelo wil good good shape shape used fast service bought cd dance class tape favorite taj mahal far released quot dancing blues taj fan unfortunately quite expecting considerable departure typical taj blues couple good fan contemporary contemporary blues blues singers prefering stuff got goin best star star rating rating seriously taj got deep gutter type sputter growl goin sings love real hot hot stuff stuff quot dark quot quot fanning flames quot love feeling quot sensually hot ballads male artist n b neo neo soul soul een come come close close dirt desire cuts artist wil
34,53,B0000000MF,"A very digestable cd, goes down smooth and free of bones.  Not very heavy, but easy to turn up loud and proud.  Toe tappin and head swingin kind of music.  A great cd to have in the car, even the kids dig it. (we do have pretty cool kids :) I usually like Taj, his open and eclectic and playful, rootsy approach, although I'm not a huge fan as some of the other reviewers seem to be. I like his 1999 collaboration, KULANJAN, with the great Malian Kora player Toumani Diabate, and 1998's playful, easy going SACRED ISLAND, with the Hula Blues Band ALOT more. I also think his 1993 hit DANCING THE BLUES is more listenable - consistent and expressive -  than this 1997 recording (but similar to this one as a mix of rock/R&B;/delta blues stylings). On this Grammy winning (go figure...!) recording he sings well and plays some nice licks as well as having some tasty horn and keyboard accompaniment, but it left me disappointed. Of the 13 tracks I only like 3, ""Queen Bee"" (prefer the version on KULANJAN tho'), ""Having A Real Bad Day"", and ""Mind Your Own Business"", some of the others are okay in a mediocre way but a couple were less desirable (""Think"" and ""Irresistable"").Overall the songs and production sounded insincere and disjointed (often only saved by the horns and fine keyboard). I would not call this blues, more like early R&B; or pop rock, and I thought it sounded too much like pale versions of James Brown (on ""At Last"" & ""Mr Pitiful""), Van Morrison (on ""Senor Blues"" & ""You Rascal You""), Dr. John (on ""Having a Real Bad Day"" & ""Sophisticated Mama), The Neville Brothers (on ""21st Century Gypsy...""), and even was reminded of Carole King's pop hit ""The Locomotion"" (on ""At Last"")! Not what I'd expect from this talented musicologist.I guess I'm left with the impression of too much variety without any real depth or verve. Like they were trying just too hard to pull it together. From the first easy lick of &quot;Honey Bee&quot; to the intense piano solo in &quot;Senor Blues&quot; you will be amazed by the ease with which Taj Mahal changes mood and style.  I second the motion!  If you don't love  this music, you are pulseless! This has to be one of my favorite Taj's records.  Great yet earthy production, soulful delivery, and cool arrangements!What more could you want? Can't see what all the fuss is about, not his best but a nice , breezy, summertime album let down by some pedestrian lyrics and same old same old songs- some people are just easy to please , me i think it contains maybe two really good songs. It made me laugh the other reviewers comments that this is ""up there with'"" kind of blue, love supreme , Robert johnson ... it's not even on the same playing field as those classics.It's nice and fun but don't expect too much and don't believe the hype - if you are new to taj the first 3 albums he did are the ones to get , for something similar but better try 'sacred island' and 'mo' roots' You take some soul, some old r &amp; b, some jazz, some blues(of course), some country and some original songs and put them together with feeling, rhythm and skillful musical performances and you have a Taj Mahal cd.  Taj never lets you down.  He has an extensive interest in music of all kinds and expresses his love of it through his singing and playing.It is always interesting to look at the songs he puts together on his cd.  On this one Steve Cropper, Otis Redding, Horace Silver, Marvin Gaye, Washboard Sam, Delbert McClinton, Hank Williams (sr.) and of course the man himself Taj Mahal are represented songwriters.  And amazingly it works, they all go together to form a cohesive cd. One of his originals 21st Century Gypsy Singin' Lover Man is a compelling new blues song.I always have to discipline myself and not over play Taj Mahal, this CD included. I had always been a fan of Taj's earlier recordings.  I didn't get into this until I saw him in concert and he played &quot;Queen Bee&quot; (which inspired me to seek out this album).  What an absolute gem.  Quite possibly his greatest album.  Every song on here is absolutely scorching, and such a wide variety of genres are represented.  If this album doesn't move you, there's something quite wrong.  Any fan of the blues or jazz, or just music in general should have this album. This is a good album.  I have rated songs for my iPod, 3 stars for those I like, 4 for those that I like alot, and 5 stars for those I can listen to any time of day or night, and find it difficult not to become totally entranced by them, even though I've heard them many times.  There are only about a dozen songs out of thousands that have made it to 5 stars.  Remarkably,  two of those songs are on this album -- ""Senor Blues"" and ""21st Century Gypsy Singin' Lover Man"".  No other album I own had two 5 star songs on them.  If you don't get the album, you should definitely download these two songs -- they are near perfection.Unfortunately, I'm not as fond of the rest of the album.  I like it, and often it hits the spot, but it really doesn't grab me all that much.  It is up-beat and energetic, but does not have the exceptional artistry and profundity of the two great songs.  I'd give the rest of the album 3+ stars, which averaged with the two gems brings it up to a 4. But then, aren't all Taj Mahal albums great? This one makes me want to drive all night til I hit Mexico. Fun album with a great bunch of musicians, but I almost wish that Taj had not used the word ""Blues"" in the title, because this album offers many diverse musical styles; the usual Taj Mahal stew of jazz, folk, country, reggae, gospel, rock, and of course blues. But these are not the sort of blues to get you down and drown in your tears, but fun, uplifting songs like ""Queen Bee"", the title cut, ""I Miss You Baby"", and a frisky cover of ""You Rascal You."" And for the outrageously low price of $3.99 you can NOT go wrong with this purchase. One other note: The product details from Amazon are a bit misleading; even though this edition of the CD was released in 2009, the original album came out in 1997. Taj is best known for his output in the 1970s, but he's in fine form on this album also. After reading Larry Fulcher's Spotlight Review, I hesitated - I mean, what am I gonna add to THAT? Well, let me say that I've written close to 110 music reviews and all but one(and Otis is long since gone..)have been Jazz reviews. So this CD is really the first non-jazz review. I don't think I could have picked a better one to begin with. ""Senor Blues"" (written by Horace Silver...so there is a segue, after all), the CD, is a brilliant statement, both musically and lyrically. It ALMOST usurps ""The Real Thing"" as my favorite Taj of all time (I'm into Live...) From the first finger-pickin' honey drippin' from ""Queen Bee"", to the unbelievably tight and minor mellow, but tough title track (the organ, and the trumpet work, is stunning), to the gospel-drenched indictment of our brave new world, ""Things Gettin' Crazy Up In Here"", to the gem - the gorgeous ""21st Century Gypsy..."" (check out the drum fill as it's fading out), to the Otis tribute (HEY! another segue..)""Mr. Pitiful"", well let's just say it's the tightest, most soulful, personal statement from this Master in a while. If you've been waiting to get a Taj CD, don't. GET THIS ONE. I was not in any way disappointed when I played this cd.  I love this type music and I have listened to it several times.  I would recommend it highly. Great songs from a unique blues artist  Taj has a great sound and you get really additiced to it.  He tels a story with every song.  All his works are good but this one is grand. This is an amazing, original, varied, heart grabbing, booty shaking, head bobbing CD. This is the disc that could turn any music fan onto Taj. It comes through on the promise of Blues, Rock, World Music, and just plain human-Being expression. It has it all and in spades. Taj puts his whole soul into every song and performance. You can't ask for more. This is the first Taj disc I was exposed to.  It is very well done including a cover of James Brown (Think), along with some original compositions.  Basically there is good reason Taj has won several grammys of late, and if you get into his music you'll immediately understand.  The title track and 21rst Century Gypsy Singin' Lover Man stand out on this set.  Queen Bee is also a great song that opens the set, and my wife likes very well.  Warning, once you discover this artist, you will find yourself digging deeper and deeper craving more.  Not the worst thing that could happen to you, Check it Out!! A great album with classic songs of Taj and a few new ones in for good measure! A great purchase ...but no less a good album for that.  Taj Mahal has throughout his career toyed with musical conventions to bring out dimensions of blues lesser players can only imitate.  Witness, among other examples on this album,  Taj's reworking of Hank Williams' &quot;Mind Your Own Business,&quot; a  classic in country music, as well as &quot;Senor Blues,&quot; with a piano  line swiped straight out of a Rachminimoff piano concerto, and the opening  track, &quot;Queen Bee,&quot; the most traditional-sounding song on the  album (and the only original Taj composition as well) that still twists  blues conventions to create an upbeat sound Muddy Waters would have been  unable to touch.  A must for both longtime fans and blues neophytes. I am constantly amazed at the breadth of Taj Mahal's musical talent. With &quot;Senor Blues&quot; he scores once again. It's all here: blues, jazz, rock, soul, and even country; all performed with alacrity by the versatile  Mahal. My favorites are the hilarious &quot;You Rascal You&quot;, the  equally funny &quot;Mind Your Own Business&quot; and the jazz classic  &quot;Senor Blues&quot;.I've always heard the last as an instrumental, and  a good one at that. I never knew the title cut had lyrics which are so  banal as to be comical. Here is a song just begging to be parodied!There is  not a bad song on the album and it is highly recommended to be given an  honored place in any music lover's collection. Having spent 39 of my 54 years as a working musician, I have spent a good portion of my time listening to and performing music. THIS IS ONE OF MY TOP 5 FAVORITE RECORDS OF ALL TIME!It was joy to record, from the first note to the last, a joy to listen to in the studio booth as we listened to playbacks, and a thrill to hear as a finished product.The tunes, even the ones that didn't make the finished CD, were a blast to play with the guys in the band. The combination of Taj's voice and the musicality of the Phantom Blues Band blended in the creation of a musical masterpiece.Now, 5 years after recording it, I still listen to it regularly (which is rare for musicians, too self-critical), and I love it more and more all the time.We really didn't know how the public or Taj's fans would react to it, it was simply where we were at musically and emotionally and spiritually at the time. But, we recorded it with love and passion and the public response was great. NO GUEST ARTISTS! Just Taj Mahal and The Phantom Blues Band and John Porter producing. 1998 GRAMMY AWARD WINNER.Personally, it's up there with &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;-Miles Davis, &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;-John Coltrane, Robert Johnson's &quot;Complete Anthology&quot;, and Bob Marley's &quot;Survival&quot;.PEACE &amp; ENJOYLarry Fulcher - bassistTaj Mahal &amp; The Phantom Blues Band I've loved this album for years. It is the one that includes my favorite song, Queen Bee. You won't be disappointed. The latin beat of this recording gives it a unique twist to the long line of ""varied"" blues sounds by Taj.  From East Africa to Delta to Latin, Taj is true to his announced desire for authenticity. This is authentic latin blues.A couple of tongue in cheek songs such as ""Mr. Pitiful"" are catchy tunes with a back-handed message. The title track, Senor Blues has a great rhythmic beat that propels the song to the forefront of your mind. When you need to step back from the chaos, reach out and touch the soul of everyman, he's THE MAN. Unadorned, from the heart blues! the beat is addictive  the words are from the soul  and  its a great collection of songs As of the end of February 2013, it was priced at $3.99.  You have to be nuts NOT to buy it at this price.  A trip through American blues, rock, jazz, and soul.  Not to be missed...especially at that priceeven if it isn't at $3.99, it's worth buying.  The era of Taj Mahal on the Private Music label was, by far, the best of his long career.  Not a must have, but pretty darn close I had heard of Taj Mahal but had never sampled his work until very recently, and I picked his 1997 album ""Senor Blues"" pretty much at random.  My experiences with Van Morrison and Dr John had got me interested in what I guess is a second or third generation of blues (the first being Leadbelly and Robert Johnson, I guess) and what we have with these musicians who are now around 60 years of age is something a bit more polished or finished than what I imagine the original blues shouters to have produced.  But there's still plenty of energy as well as polish on ""Senor Blues"" with a range of material running from the late 1990's back to around 1930 (""I'll be glad when you're dead"") and taking in work by Hank Williams (""Mind your own Business""), Delbert McClintock, Marvin Gaye, and Sam Cooke.  It's all great.  The title track is a beauty, as is ""I must have had a bad day"" and everything else on the album.  The backup band is right on point (nice brass work), and there's a lot of variety to the material.  Vocally, Taj can go rough or smooth as the song demands.  The whole thing is a delight.  The transformation of pain into pleasure is one of the great mysteries of art -- why do we leave ""King Lear"" feeling uplifted? -- and on a very fundamental level, the blues has a similar effect.  Highly recommended. Taj IS spoofing (or maybe better said ""tributing"") the man who DID the tune Mr. Pitiful - and it ain't James Brown. It is Otis Redding. I can see where some could prefer other Taj; but if you don't like him all that much anyway (or love him...) and you don't get the allusions to other artists (let alone know who they are...)...well,,,hence the Review Title. Long one of my favorite musicians, I think this is one of his best. Taj brings a zest to music that is hard to rival, not to mention his enduring career as an &#34;out of the mainstream&#34; musician. His cds can be bought so cheaply it's one of the true bargains out there if you enjoy his blend of blues genres. &#34;Senor Blues&#34; was issued in 1997.  On this album he brings some 60s flavor with a few tunes such as &#34;Think&#34;, &#34;Things Are Gettin' Crazy Up In Here&#34;, &#34;Mr. Pitiful&#34;, and bit of country-style blues such as &#34;Mind Your Own Business&#34; featuring his trademark National Steel Guitar work. The title track &#34;Senor Blues&#34; is a cool smooth jazzy Horace Silver tune. I particularly like &#34;21st Century Gypsy Singin' Lover Man&#34;. As always Taj brings outstanding musicians to the studio always bringing a well-crafted product full of enthusiasm. I saw Taj perform live 2 years ago at 69 years of age and it was unbelievable how much energy he brought to the stage. He absolutely rocked the house.","Classic Country,Contemporary Folk,Country,Pop,Traditional Folk,Electric Blues,Modern Blues,Acoustic Blues,Traditional Blues,Contemporary Blues,Blues,Folk",digestable cd goes smooth free bones heavy easy turn loud proud toe tappin head swingin kind great cd car even kids dig pretty cool kids usually like taj open eclectic playful rootsy approach although im huge fan reviewers seem like collaboration kulanjan great malian kora player toumani diabate playful easy going sacred island hula blues band alot also think hit dancing blues listenable consistent expressive recording similar one mix rock r b delta blues stylings grammy winning go figure recording sings well plays nice licks well tasty horn keyboard accompaniment left disappointed like queen bee prefer version kulanjan tho real bad day mind business oth cd smooth free bones heavy easy turn loud proud toe head swingin kind great cd car kids dig pretty cool cool kids kids usually like open eclectic playful approach im huge fan reviewers seem collaboration kulanjan great malian kora player toumani diabate playful easy sacred sacred island island hula blues blues band think hit dancing blues listenable consistent expressive recording similar mix rock delta delta blues blues stylings winning go figure figure recording sings plays nice licks tasty horn keyboard accompaniment left disappointed queen queen bee bee prefer version kulanjan tho real bad day mind business

I am totally sold on purchasing any and all of the books, DVd's and CD's thru Amazon, finding that shopping this way one of my best experiences. Enjoyed this music immensely! Plan on purchasing more of his music and will do so periodically.  If there were more stars I would put thus CD at the top rating.  Thank you. I was thrilled to find this CD (new) online.  As with all of Yanni's music, it is incredible.  He is so talented. Enjoy Yanni. &quot;DEVOTION&quot; is a powerful collection of Yanni's best.  Listen to it at work - helps the concentration.  Recommend this to all Yanni fans and new listeners as well.  Good variety of rythms.  Very  enjoyable. (I also like most classical music). Yes, this is a five star CD.  But other Yanni CD's deserve a six.  Although the mix has beautiful songs, the flow is not as good on &quot;The  Best of Yanni&quot;  as with his other CD's. I recommend others to buy his  other great musical works of art. I purchased this CD to replace cassette (especially for Aria). Arrived in perfect condition. Thank you. If you're a Yanni's fan, you'll love this recording. The sound quality is incredible and the music selected is very rewarding. Is something of another sound, more loving, more romantic and as always ends with Sartorini. I had the opportunity to visit the island and as you climb the rough terrain you feel that the music goes with you. All my life I have been a fan of Yanni and this Cd with his greatest hits is just excellent. If you like Yanni you will definitely like this cd. This music sooths, when most of the world is loud.  It heals when much of our environment is harmful.  Creative music, very inventive!  Another five star CD from our friend Yanni!! I usually like yanni's music.But this was a disappointment. I only liked 2 songs on it.Come on Yanni,you're a great artist.You can do better. I have been a Yanni fan ever since I got his ""Dare to Dream"" album in 1992.  The ""Devotion"" album is in my opinion, a collection of Yanni's best compositions.  I have always thought that he is a genius when it comes to composing music.  This album has selections from eight of Yanni's albums.  There are selections from ""Dare to Dream"" and one composition from that album called ""To the One Who Knows"" is probably my favorite instrumental.  There are also piano selections on ""Devotion"" and I really enjoy his piano composition called ""To Take .. To Hold"" from the album ""In My Time"".  After listening to Yanni, I have found his music so relaxing and peaceful. I think he is so good on the piano, that I have been inspired to do more with playing piano myself.Yanni's music is so original. I saw him in concert in 2003 in Colorado Springs.  On ""Devotion"", Yanni's music is everything from synthesized orchestra to melodious solo piano.  I would recommend ""Devotion"" to every Yanni fan. It really is the best of his work. You can never go wrong listening to Yanni.  This is another great, solid, variation of music that you can enjoy. Simply as that, it makes my soul smile. I just love it. It uplifts my spirit when I hear it. Yey Yanni! I love all of Yanni's music and play it while driving in my car.  Also play it with a nice glass of wine at the end of a stressful day.  He is a great artist. ""An ordinary musician creates music,a master musician creates gaps""The gaps make you blissful and ecstatic.What is this album called debotion? .It is a course in self love.As you begin to like this songs, you will pride yourself on giving to yourself such a wonderful gift.1- Once upon a time - One of the best.Very joyous 10/102- Within attraction - A somewhat jungle kind of feel 7/103- Song for Antartica - Very very beautiful  9/104- Aria - A very beautiful song but lacking the joy of song for Antartica.NEvertheless,fantastic song  8/105- Love for Life - Best of the best.So so beautiful,so so poignant.Sorry, but i am too small a person to judge the genius of yanni.  10/106- Reflectins of Passion - Very very beautiful,very very melodious.A very beautiful flower in the bouquet of devotion. 9/107- To take.. to hold - Are you kidding,me comment on this song?.I have only one word to say- one of the best piano pieces in the history of music.The zenith of poignance,the climax of emotion  10/108- Flight of fantasy- Another great melody.The msot melodious song in the album 9/109- To the one who knows- You might as well float with this song cuz this song is just like a river.very harmonious  9/1010- The end of august - beautiful,just like a lady.A charm of her own.A grace of her own  8/1011- Marching season - Indescribable,immeasurable.I don't understand whether this song belongs in this album or not.12- Santorini - Great for dancing,fast paced with a melody of it's own.Simply excellent13- Nice to meet you- this music takes you to cloud nine.Great buildup,great twists & turns,yet the melody is intact  10/1014- A night to remember - A music that brings you ecstasy.?Yanni msut have been in bliss composing this song.Thank you yanni and thank you all of those who are reading my review I use this when i'm writing papers, grading student work, or just need some relaxing music in the background during a planning period. Yanni has never failed to please me. Love his music. First, as the staff reviewer pointed out, six cuts come from the same album, &quot;Dare To Dream&quot;.  And then, the later &quot;The Very Best of Yanni&quot;, has six cuts that this album has.  Mathematically, we're talking about 2/5 of the CD being &quot;Dare To Dream&quot;, and 2/5 being &quot;The Very Best of Yanni.&quot;  Since two of the dupes between the &quot;best&quot; albums come from &quot;Dare To Dream&quot;, this means 2/3 of the CD is on one of the two other albums.Yet, the remaining five do work to give this album a mellower and more classical seeming sound than the &quot;Very Best&quot;...&quot;Within Attrcation&quot; is bombastic with less piano work. The other four are much stronger on the piano and are more dreamy, sensitive and evocative.  &quot;Song of Antartica&quot; has some of the ethereal quality that &quot;Aria&quot; has.  &quot;Reflections of Passion&quot; is, to me, the deepest and most moving of the five and one of the real standouts of the entire compilation, with truly passionate piano. &quot;To Take...To Hold&quot; is ultimately sensive and evocative, while &quot;Only A Memory&quot; is dreamy.So what you have here is a compilation which has to have a lot of familiarity to it due to the duplication, and yet has a romantic, passionate voice of its own. I was very impressed by this CD.  I have been a Yanni fan ever  since I saw &quot;Live at the Acropolis&quot; in 1994.  This is real music.  Music that you feel in your soul. How can you go wrong with Yanni? His CD's are almost as good as seeing him in concert! Bravo Bravo I REALLY WATCHED YANNI LIVE AND HE MADE AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN IN 2005. HIS MUSIC IS MY THERAPY WHEN I AM FEELING BLUE. IT JUST GIVES ME GOOSE BUMPS AND MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. SO SERENE AND FULL OF LOVE AND EMOTIONS.YOU GOT TO LOVE YOURSELF FIRST THEN LOVE MUSIC AS SUCH! I love Yanni's music. This one seems to be a rehash of past songs. Not much energy in the album as a whole. This CD is a great piece to have in your collection.  It is easy listening and the CD is wonderful.  The seller was prompt in sending it. Yanni is a Phenomenal music writer, composer, creator, and has his own magnificent Universal Sound to share withEveryone Globally and touches our hearts with true angelic melodies from his heart to our's. He is the best. I bought three of his DVDs.  I love his musicI have the records in my car and really enjoying the sounds. I have been an avid Yanni fan since I first became old enough to listen to music.  I must say though, this CD is by far the most awe inspiring collection of musical brilliance I have ever encountered!  I own at least three copies of each of his CD's, and eight copies of DEVOTION: THE BEST OF YANNI.  Listening to Yanni's music has really put things into perspective for me, and has improved my life holistically!  I recommend this CD for anyone who has ears! I'm Young Jun Kim from South KOREA republic.Your kindness came from through the album.Revolution theory made man men.Creative theory made woman keep.Serpent madness made people ghosts!Rain Run & Run made human nude!Calming proposed!Good bye!Sincerely,","Adult Alternative,Adult Contemporary,Progressive,Jazz,Pop,New Age,Rock,Meditation,Electronic",enjoy listening yannis current work yet sweetness earlier recordings want savor man emotion oozing go long drive listen beauty sounds come stereo anna know personally want yannis right every one made cd player outdoor gazabos cd player car cd player studio listen continuely yannis slip il devo prefered listening pleasure hear types whats news etc depressing cant rate yannis higher whats offered please buy enjoy also reccomend purchase amazon com prices really great prompt delivery incredible totally sold purchasing books dvds cds thru amazon finding shopping way one best experie enjoy listening yannis current work sweetness earlier recordings want savor man emotion oozing long drive listen beauty sounds come stereo anna know personally want right cd cd player player outdoor cd cd player player car cd cd player player studio listen yannis slip prefered listening pleasure hear types whats news depressing rate yannis higher whats offered buy enjoy purchase amazon amazon com com prices really great prompt delivery incredible totally sold purchasing books dvds cds amazon finding shopping way best
36,55,B0000000MJ,"You love Smooth Jazz, you love Soul, you love black male and female vocals. Why are you hesitating? This cd is the right choice, to fullfil your wishes. Phil Perry is a consummate artist with a huge following.  Singing in a jazzy vein, he interprets these songs with panache.Every song rocks.  I enjoy it very much.  Grade: A Wonderful old school CD by one of the premier male singer still around for everyone to enjoy.Really enjoyed the songs. His voice is velvet. This is a perfect relaxation album. This was a good value for my money.Love it much The Last post is a joke. I believe this album is timeless and passionate. although he pays homage to Al Green in his medley it is a tribute and he sings it his way. such is a tribute, otherwise Al Green would pay  homage to himself and wouldnt that be silly??? He also pays homage to George Duke with &quot; born to Love you&quot; which was produced by George Duke and sang by him in 1983 on his &quot;Guardian of the light&quot; lp. Again He sings it his way and it is beautiful. This is CD is not for Teeny boppers but it can be appreciated by younger people i.e. my daughter loves him and she is 13. This is better appreciated by a more mature audience. light the candles, dim the lights and break out the merlot.only a fool wouldnt by it.buy and listen with your heart. Phil has that silky smooth sound as you expect.  Good album for your listening pleasure!  With all the computer generated noise out there great vocals is elusive.  Enjoy! Phil Perry is a singer i have been listening  to for years.I have been to several of his concerts ,Back in  the 80's when he sung with a group he was a back up singer but his voice out done the lead singer.he has sung with many other groups since then and is a wonderful jazz singer if you want to hear a fantastic singe get one of his CD. I truly enjoy the smooth silky voice and lyrical delivery of Phil Perry.  His style of delivering touchy love songs continues on this album and I would recommend it. I have been needing to replace this music for some time and I am too happy for this replacement.  Thanks i think Phil perry has a good voice.but this generic material does him no justice.the Al Green Medley is very Weak&amp; Sad.Wine Cooler R-N-B.very boring. I was introduced to Mr. Perry with another of his  CD'S, through a friend of mines. I Love this Cd and plan to get all of his work. I am A person who longs to hear real singing. I long to feel the artist's talent and Mr. Perry can sing is face off. I love the debut with his wife? I look forward to reviewing his other Cd's in the future.

37,56,B0000000SC,"This one just rocks its way into your heart the whole short time it's playing.  Each song is a condensed pop gem, quickly and roughly hewn out of Lou and John's (then) exuberant love of noise and syncopation.These songs were not deliberated and edited to death -- au contraire, they are still steaming they are so freshly and jaggedly sliced from the squirming rock-fabric.Fun to throw on at parties.

Some interesting melodys and songs. this is good. Many years ago I got this album because I knew I had liked the Folk Implosion songs I had heard on the KIDS Soundtrack.  This is nothing like those, but I liked it nearly as much.  It's a totally different sound than what they would eventually make.  This is the type of music you wish that you and your friends could sit around making at your apartment for fun.  It's very lo-fi and that just makes it feel more like you were there recording it with them, laughing at all the silly ideas and lyrics they came up with.  The only downfall is that it's a bit too short.

38,57,B0000000SP,"I found this album not surprising in the least (which, I suppose, is surprising), but the short generally-catchy numbers made for a pleasant listen.  The lo-fi/no-fi sound quality occasionally put me off, but  generally fit the material.  I especially liked &quot;Insinuation&quot;  (which, yeah, sounds like 'that other song'), &quot;Ball &amp; Chain&quot;  and the title track.  A few more catchy songs wouldn't've hurt.  Nothing  horribly innovative or essential, but a good ride while it lasts. This album is like a drug. It puts you in a euphoric trance. This album defines Lo-Fi. Every album Lou Barlow has had a hand in has gotten better and better. This one is classic, therefore One Part Lullaby is even more so. Buy them both. A disappointment, especially compared to the superb One Part Lullaby. Thankfully, they have moved on to make better music. Either that, or I can't tell what's cool anymore.Even at 30, I still think this is an unpolished alternative gem. Warm,lo-fi minimalist pluckings showcase introspective love bummer lyrics that chronicle the darker side of affection. Sure, it isn't radio friendly, but is that the measure of goodness? You'll get high mileage out of this CD-hard to tire of. Shoegazers take note, this is your record. this cd reminds me of having movie vision and terrets Yes, definitely One Part Lullaby made use of more instruments, but that doesn't mean that it has a better sound. If you were already a fan of the Folk Implosion, you would get bored of One Part Lullaby easily; it sounds as if trying to go mainstream. I highly recommend Dare to be Surprised because it has more of an original and lo-fi sound. Great album.","Alternative Rock,Indie Rock,Indie & Lo-Fi,Lo-Fi,Pop,Rock,American Alternative",found surprising least suppose surprising short generally catchy numbers made pleasant listen lo fi fi sound quality occasionally put generally fit material especially liked quot insinuation quot yeah sounds like quot ball amp chain quot title catchy wouldntve hurt nothing horribly innovative essential good ride lasts like drug puts euphoric trance defines lo fi every lou barlow hand gotten better better one classic therefore one part lullaby even buy disappointment especially compared superb one part lullaby thankfully moved make better either cant tell whats cool anymore even still think unpolished alternative gem warm lo fi minimalist pluckings showcase introspective love bummer lyrics c found surprising suppose surprising short generally catchy numbers pleasant listen sound sound quality quality occasionally generally fit material especially liked quot insinuation quot yeah sounds quot ball amp chain quot title catchy hurt horribly innovative essential good ride drug euphoric euphoric trance trance defines lou barlow barlow hand gotten better better better classic lullaby buy disappointment especially compared superb lullaby thankfully better tell whats cool anymore think unpolished alternative gem warm minimalist pluckings showcase introspective love bummer lyrics
39,58,B0000000U8,"I bought this recording on vinyl at Aron's Records in Hollywood, CA in 1987, a used promo copy in mint condition pressed on Quiex II Vinyl. I still have it, and just played it the other day, not knowing that the ailing Mr. Castro-Neves would be leaving us shortly. This recording brings back many memories... of that period when I bought it, and also of the few times that I was fortunate enough to meet Oscar Castro-Neves at gigs here in the Los Angeles area. The music is wonderful, and if I may be so biased, probably sounds best on vinyl. Highly recommended. This beautiful cd has beautiful music and delicates melodies. Oscar Castro-Neves meets are another great artist such as Paul Winter bringing us introspective music where excellent soloists participate as the cellist Eugene Friesen, the flutist Rhonda Larson, the same Paul Winter on sax, John Clake in the corno, the pianist Paul Halley. Any way, a cd to enjoy. I am bossa nova music lover, I found this cd in a closed store many year ago, I was very impress for the execution of this prominent guitarrist.

40,63,B00000010J,"Excellent. Deep, inspiring house music. If you are not motivated to dance by this music, start checking out grave plots. Nice mixture of horns and vocals, all of it laid out over percussion for the soul(and your feet).  Even if you are completely sick of &quot;The bomb&quot;(I for one am not),  it is a worthy purchase. The remix of the original Chicago song &quot;Street Player&quot; is AWESOME!  Its a great song to begin with, and this mix just turns it into a club song.  I'm glad they left Cetera's voice and the Chicago horns intact.  Check out the original &quot;Street Player&quot; on Chicago 13!! if you like house, you have to have this cd!'the bomb' is a classic house track and you get a short version and a remix.  what more could you ask for?except great use of samples from run the gamut of old school r and b and jazz and very respectful covers of tunes like 'got myself together'. plus fillers like 'whew' and 'sayin' dope' make for a good listening experience at the club, getting to the club, or getting your workout on so you can wear the jeans you want to wear at the club! This is a studio remix exercise for playing in dance clubs.  It was released in 1995.  It is 62 minutes long and the sound quality is very good.This is your typical remix dance album, with music being put into tape loops.  It is the type of music that is great if you are up and dancing, but will give you a headache under any other conditions.  If you are the kind to go to a club and sit and drink, you wouldn't appreciate it.I think that in some parts there is too much digital looping.  In the beginning, it sounds as if your CD player is getting stuck.  I find much of it to be tedious.There is one great track that you can just enjoy on its own.  It is called Just Plain Funky, and it is exactly that.  It contains longer loops and flows fairly nice.The other good track is The Bomb (These Sounds Keep Falling In My Mind), which could of been great with a little self control on the mix.The Bucketheads is just another studio project from remixer, Kenny Gonzalez.  Don't confuse it with avant garde musician Buckethead. Are you kidding? The Bucketheads (Kenny Dope) create for the ages. If you can't deal with dis, you are. . . .? This cd is a House album with 70's style funky music, and vocals.The title track ""the bomb"" is just awsome. It was a disco hit back when it came out. Nowadays this is just a 1 hit wonder, eve if the whole cd is awsome.This cd could easily be Daft Punk's third album (for their first was 90's style and their second 80's style).This cd makes me bounce and bop every time i put it on. If you do not find yourself dancing a few minutes into the first song, then you gotta check your head, for something maybe wrong in your motrice system.If you like house music, funk, and dancing, this is a cd you will definetively enjoy! This has the cool version of The Bomb..the loooooooong version thank goodness.  The rest of the cd is pretty good.  It's a good background cd to clean the house to, or just trip out on.","R&B,House,Soul,Pop,Dance & Electronic,Dance Pop,Blues",excellent deep inspiring house motivated dance start checking grave plots nice mixture horns vocals laid percussion soul feet even completely sick quot bomb quot one worthy purchase remix original chicago quot street player quot awesome great begin mix turns club im glad left ceteras voice chicago horns intact check original quot street player quot chicago like house cd bomb classic house get short version remix could ask except great use samples run gamut old school r b jazz respectful covers tunes like got together plus fillers like whew sayin dope make good listening experience club getting club getting workout c excellent deep inspiring house motivated dance start checking grave plots nice mixture horns vocals laid percussion soul feet completely sick quot bomb quot worthy purchase remix original chicago quot street player quot awesome great begin mix turns club im im glad glad left ceteras voice chicago horns intact check original street player quot chicago house cd bomb classic house short version remix ask great samples run gamut old old school school jazz respectful covers tunes got fillers sayin dope make good good listening experience club club workout
41,66,B00000011H,"Since last year (2004), it's been hard for me to pull out my RBL discs, simply because nothing but tragedy has hit this group: first, the murder of fellow rapper Mr. Cee, and last year, the muder of the EXTREMELY talented Hitman, who was killed at an intersection (he was in his late teens/early 20s). His crazy similies, really good rapping voice, cool flow, and nice cadence will definitely be missed, especially by his fans (like me).For anyone that's been following RBL know they gangbang (Bloods), and it's really just been really hard to enjoy this album since Hitman's death (maybe it's because like he was, I'm young and it troubles me that so many young black men are losing their lives over ignorant silliness and nonsense). Needless to say, leader of the group, Black C is a truly gifted brother - he handles a lot of RBL's production and offers two beats on this joint: ""Straight Lacin,"" the fifth track and ""You Can't Hang"" (track 11). Black C's most recent effort (a solo album) is aptly, as well as unfortunately, titled ""Last Man Standing."" Although it's almost futile to say this (which in itself is bad to say), I hope the remaining members of RBL find some positivity outside of gangbangin, because it'd be terrible for all of the members to be killed...Aside from the tragic aura surrounding this group, I'd say this album is not on par with their previous effort, the excellent ""Ruthless By Law"" (which is what RBL stands for), but this is still a VERY strong third release. The excellent ""More Game"" (with a phat beat by the always on point west coast beatsmith, Mike Mosley) features a heartfelt ode to fallen homies by Oakland veteran Richie Rich.Other dope tracks are the first song ""The Individual"" (although I think the nearly minute long a capella intro to the song was a bit much, as well as annoying - just play the song, guys!), ""How We Comin (Southern Fried Mix),"" ""Straight Lacin,"" ""An Eye For An Eye,""  one of my RBL favorites of all time, the AWESOME ""Til the End,"" and the insanely vicious ""Gotta Git Mine"" (featuring rap veteran MC Eiht of the classic group CMW, and the south's Tela - see my review of his ""Piece of Mind"" debut - and a pre-Cash Money TQ crooning the chorus).An interesting tidbit: I read in a magazine a few months ago an explosive bit of news about Big Lurch (the tall, deep-voiced dude featured on ""How We Comin,"" as well as C-BO's song ""Hard Labor"" on his ""Til My Casket Drops"" album). According to producer Rick Rock (who used to be in a group with Big Lurch and a cat named Doonie Baby back in '96 called the Cosmic Slop Shop, and now currently heads up the group, 'The Federation'), Lurch murdered his 21-year old girlfriend, was found naked in an alley with blood all over him, opened her chest, and had eaten one of her lungs...wow. I don't even know what to say to that. (Copy the following address into your browser search bar to read more: [...])WARNING: RBL Posse is west coast rap, so you know it's hardcore gangsta rap...for real. I'm more of a hip hop head but I still bump RBL because they're dope and always jam hard. Of course I don't judge them, but although I love RBL, I get a semi-nauseous feeling just knowing that we've been robbed of two of their most talented members...and there's the possibility of them all dying to senseless street violence. Definitely, they provide us with good music, but our entertainment is their reality. All sorrows aside, this is definitely hardcore gangsta rap at its finest...and ROUGHEST. For those in the west coast, your southern brethren down here got RBL knockin the speakers in the trunk - we're not sleeping! HAPPY SPENDING! the best cut on this effort is most likely the last track, ""Til' The End (featuring The P-O-S-S-E)""  just my humble opinion though, as I had to repeat-play it several times because of the groovy flow 8^)bottom line...if you do pick up this CD for your collection make sure to play the LAST TRACK FIRST!!! MR.CEE AND BLACK CHRIS WERE HELLA TIGHT TOGETHER WHO SHOT MR.CEE? RBL POSSE IS TIGHT I LIKE LESSON TO BE LEARNED AND RUTHLESS BY LAW I WISH IHAD RUTHLESS BY LAW THE CD CUZ I ALREADY HAVE THE OTHER ONE ON TAPE. ONE LAST  THING RBL IS TIGHT AND PASS ME THE ZIG ZAGS. San Francisco's RBL Posse releases its 3rd album in fall 1997.  These guys are known for their dark, mobb sound over hard beats.  Anyone reading this who has heard the first 2, esp. Ruthless By Law from 1994 will agree.  Ruthless... had a horror-core mobb music overture with loud, piercing whiny synths and violent imagery.  This album can be gangsta too, but there is a more laidback, sunnier G-Funk feel to it.  Richie Rich stops by on the playa and hustlin' ""More Game"" over a smooth guitar ridden beat.  Another game spitter is the Mtume ""Juicy"" beat sampled ""Straight Lacin'"" which is str8 fire.  The beat is sunny and has a good rider vibe to it.  ""You Can't Hang"" has a One Way ""Cutie Pie"" beat pattern, and is a bit darker and more gangsta.  ""Concrete Jungle"" has another laidback funk feel and has a contemplative feel.  RBL wonder what could've happened if they did not have rap to go forward.  They drop street philosophy over the sweet keyboard ridden beat.  RBL get positive on the smooth ""Strictly This Game"" and look at staying true and trying to stay on top of the rap game without selling out.  This joint is so cool to relax to or ride to on a sunny day, kinda like a Warren G joint it's so chill.  ""How We Comin"" features Mystikal and Bigg Lurch.  There are 2 mixes, the Southern which has an odd beat, and the West Side mix which is talkbox ridden G-Funk, and they all get their mobb on. ""Gone Away"" is a reflective joint over another sunny, relaxed keyboard G-Funk beat.  They also drop some lines about unity how many do not think about consequences in hood life, and how they don't want to see their homies fall victim to the cycle of gang life.  All in all, this album is another classic in their discog.  It is chock full of great G-Funk beats, an interesting alternative to their harsh Ruthless By Law, which is also a classic gangsta rap milestone from the bay. LIKE FIRST REVIEWER SAID IT'S A MASTERPIECE! & I AGREE TOTALLY! TIGHT FEATURES TELA FROM RAP A LOT (PICK UP HIS RAP A LOT LPS CUZ HE'S DOPE), BIG LURCH, RICHIE RICH, MC EIHT, MYSTIKAL, ETC. & LIKE ANOTHER REVIEWER IT'S DEFINITELY DEPRESSING TOO TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THE PASSING OF THE GROUP MEMBERS!

42,67,B00000012P,"First let me say I'm glad I'm not the only person to review this since the early 2000s. Let me also say these reviews helped me judge the CD more poorly than the group. I just might try a stereo version next. Looks like the US release of album #1 had a much better song list. I am a fan of original mono when the original tracks were mixed that way. I own some really terrible remastered stereo Beatles CDs. A lot of mono songs have a punch that's unbeatable. This CD does not have punch. It can barely make a fist.This is one of the oddest collections of songs released into the rock and roll prime era. 'Concrete and Clay' is very good, but being just about the best track here I'd recommend the much more lively Eddie Rambeau version. The covers are Karaoke at best except for Girl From NY City. And I've never been a fan of mixing fully different genres on one record. R & R with Leadbelly's 'Cotton Fields' or '500 Miles.' And 'Swing Down Chariot'...Really?  What a ridiculous choice.Okay, I got that out of my system. Now, the originals are lightweight but quite enjoyable and by the time I reached the bonus tracks I was glad I bought this. Album 2 opens with an early Hollies sounding 'Butterfly,' and 'I Will' is like the precursor of both Bubblegum and The Ramones. As the tracks play out, the sound progresses to what sounds like pre 3 Dod Night and then back out again. With better song supervision and some constructive criticism these could have been great songs, not just mildly interesting. They also needed a bit more money spent on a Producer.  I found 'Baby Never Say Goodbye' the best on this 2nd LP, despite a repeat of the 'Concrete and Clay' mold. 'Loving Takes...' is nothing more than a repetitive vocal exercise, but 'Booby Trap' an interesting use of a great Harrison-style riff.Most of the bonus material is pretty good. Again, you have to already be a 60s music freak like me to want to put this kind of CD on. I'm just happy to continue my quest for the unknown.A final note: If you are into the genius of Brian Wilson you should check out the final cut 'I Won't Let You Down.' It follows a Beach Boys style that takes in some wild chord progressions. Unit 4 + 2 is one of my favorite (there may be 100 + or so) groups of all time.  Since I grew up during the so-called ""British Invasion"", that undoubtedly has a lot to do with it.  Unit 4 + 2's first lp simply entitled ""#1 featuring Concrete & Clay"" was, I think, the fourth album I ever bought (the first three were ""Doo Wah Diddy Diddy"" by Manfred Mann, ""True Love Ways"" by Peter & Gordon & ""Out Of Our Heads"" by the Rolling Stones---one selling point for me being that those first 3 were monaural, and the Unit 4 + 2 lp was stamped ""stereo"").  Having become so intimately familiar with the American release vinyl version of Unit 4 + 2's first effort, therefore, I must say that I was more than a bit disappointed by this CD.  Sure, I was warned beforehand that it was going to be mixed down in fabulous mono, still, I was, as I say, disappointed having to listen to these tracks in flat mode since many of them were in stereo on the original vinyl release.  But where else was I going to find a digital copy of this gem?  Although some of the songs on the vinyl were mono (""Concrete & Clay"" being one---all of them tweaked out in shotty ""re-processed stereo"" so popular in that day), others, some of them my all-time faves, were clearly in lovely stereo.  ""Sorrow And Pain"", ""Wild Is The Wind"", and ""Cross A Million Mountains"" all suffer from monomania on this CD release.  You should hear them in stereo:  they pulse & throb with rhythm across the stereo band with a full bodied magnificence.  What a shame.  Guess I'll have to go to the bother of converting these vinyl tracks to digital myself.Another disappointment to me, since I got the American version of the album, is the fact that 2 of the songs on that album were not included on this CD.  They were ""Tell Somebody You Know"" (an infectious hand-clapping gospel rocker) and ""Woman From Liberia"" (a rollicking Jimmie Rodgers cover, and they give it a marvelous guitars-banjo-vocal-congas-percussion Unit 4 + 2 treatment that reminds me a little bit of some cartoon sequence of a leaky kitchen sink dancing around the room.  But only if I think about it.  No I ain't smoked nothin'.).  ""When I Fall In Love"", the cover tune on the B-side of the ""Concrete And Clay"" 45 rpm, is a beautiful mainly vocal harmony offering that I would love to have a clean copy of.  A-ha! I see that there has been a CD issued called ""Singles As & Bs"" just now, and it has this track on it.  Can someone tell me if any of these songs are in stereo?As for the group itself---a most peculiar idiosyncratic mix of about 6 English cats with something like 5-part coffeehouse folk harmonies backed by driving percussive Latin rock, with a very distinctive south-of-the-border guitar orientation.  All of which is quite evident on their first (& to my knowledge only) single hit.  One of the things I like about these guys is that they seemed to be from some working-poor hole in the wall, and it seems to show in the music---and in the talent.  As an excerpt from the liner notes on the lp says, ""The vocal harmony proved good enough for them to win on October 22nd, 1962, the National Boys Club award for vocal groups presented by Frankie Vaughan at the Royal Festival Hall.""  Sounds like a humble beginning to me, but they had ambition and drive, and produced some great music.Having said a lot about the first album material on this CD, I can't say much for the rest.  Sounds a bit schmaltzy & overly commercial to my ears, like maybe they were being steered too much by record producer types trying to mold & manipulate them.  I don't recall hearing any standouts on the remainder, but I do recall maybe a few that I couldn't stand.  I don't recommend this CD to anyone but the most die-hard fan & completist, as a curiosity and a sort of ""rise and fall"" kind of thing.  But I haven't listened to it extensively.  Maybe it's just unfamiliar to me.  I'll give it another spin sometime (since I've already sprung the money for it).{Correction:  I have since found some tracks amongst those that remained that I would say are worth a listen.  One early favorite for me was ""I Won't Let You Down"", included under ""Additional Tracks"".  It has that punch, vocal complexity and exuberance characteristic of the original Unit 4 + 2 sound.  Also, ""Face In My Head"" is quite lovely and has interesting harmonic textures.  As it turns out, both of these were penned by Parker/Moeller, who seemed to have written all the group's best tunes.  So, definitely, give this CD a thorough listen.}Also, since I have praised the American release of their first album, I should clarify which songs were on that record.  They were:Concrete And Clay***************You've Never Been In Love Like This BeforeSorrow And Pain*****************La BambaCouldn't Keep It Myself************Woman From LiberiaYou'll Remember*****************Wild Is The WindCotton Fields*******************The Girl From New York CityTell Somebody You Know**********Cross A Million MountainsYeah, mixing classic stuff like this down in mono seems to be all the rage these days (check out the Kinks ""Face To Face"" on the mcps/Sanctuary Midline label---yeah, all mono.  Also some of the Motown reissues.  Many others.).  I don't even want to go into what they did to the Honeycombs on that ""Very Best Of"" CD release (just read the reviews).  Guess they figure you'll shell out more hard-earned bucks a few years down the line for the new improved stereo version of whatever ( a la the Zombies' Decca Stereo Anthology---great one though it is, or the Beach Boys ""Pet Sounds"" stereo/mono reissue CD.  Hey, I almost forgot about the exclusively mono treatment they did to all the tracks on every early Beatles lp up to Help!, yet you can find stereo versions of some of the same songs on at least one expensive compilation.  I'm still in the process of transfering stereo album cuts, like from ""The Early Beatles"" into digital, 'cause they got way more depth and soul and are more exciting than lousy linear mono).I give this Unit 4 + 2 CD 3 stars, not out of any lack of love for the group, but because it just doesn't do the spirit of the group justice.  Maybe those who decide these things will get it right later on (and maybe they'll do the Honeycombs justice, too). 2004 RAPWreckerds This six-piece was one of several UK vocal groups whose blues-tinged folk-styled harmonies grew out of the British skiffle sound and the American folk-revival. Their earliest work (including their debut single ""Cotton Fields"" and a cover of ""500 Miles"") applied their smooth, multipart harmonies to standards that were blossoming in Greenwich Village. By their second single, ""Sorrow and Pain,"" the rhythms were more sophisticated, and their third single, ""Concrete and Clay"" became the group's commercial high water mark. The single's bossa nova beat and Spanish-styled acoustic guitar runs were memorable then, and still sound unique to this day.The band tried their hand at soul and gospel sides, a bit like the Box Tops, and as the '60s progressed they dabbled in organ-driven psychedelia with ""3.30"" and electrified their folk roots with a cover of Bob Dylan's ""You Ain't Going Nowhere."" Try as they might, they couldn't duplicate the success of ""Concrete and Clay"" (even when they recorded the knock-off ""Baby Never Say Goodbye""), and never developed a commercial identity distinct from the hit. Their recorded legacy, represented here by a pair of albums and six bonus tracks, shows Unit 4 + 2 to be a talented group who simply didn't have the material or spark of others then on the scene.Repertoire's 1993 29-track collection pulls together both albums released by the group on Decca, plus six bonus tracks - all in mono. The same label has recently dropped a 30-track compilation that focuses on the band's singles and includes the latter-day ""I Was Only Playing Games,"" among other tracks missed here. With so many other UK vocal groups' catalogs available (Searchers, Gerry & The Pacemakers, Zombies, The Ivy League, et al), this isn't a necessity, but if you loved ""Concrete and Clay,"" there's more to hear from Unit 4 +2. [2007 hyperbolium dot com] I'd get this album for the title cut alone.Without a doubt,&quot;Concrete And Clay&quot;,has to be oneof the all-time great guitar songs recorded.Ithas a folksy,Latin rythmn to it.Well done,wellwritten. I bought this CD because I had read that members of the Roulettes played a big part in this band.I think The Roulettes was one the greatest English 1960`s bands that never really made it ( try to check out their CD! ), so I had hopes that this CD would be of the same high standards.I was pretty disappointed. Maybe it`s unfair to compare this act with the Roulettes, because their styles are so different. I would rather compare Unit 4 + 2 with the Seekers or the softer side of the Searchers.Their big hit &quot;Concrete and Clay&quot; is a good and catchy 1960`s pop song, but the majority of these songs sound dated and without profile. Even the rocking songs sound like their were played for Granny on her 75th birthday.Who needs yet another version of &quot;Cottonfields&quot; or &quot;La Bamba&quot;?Their version of Bob Dylan`s &quot;You Ain`t Going Nowhere&quot; is pretty good, though.A lot of obscure British 1960`s bands made some terrific records, but apart from &quot;Concrete and Clay&quot; I don`t think Unit 4+2 has much to offer. I 'm glad to find this c d .I like the songs and it was a good price for all the songs that were on it. This British group originally comprised Peter Moules (lead vocal), David Meikle (guitar), Howard Lubin (guitar) and Thomas Moeller (keyboards) and was called Unit 4. Before achieving any success, Rod Garwood (bass) and Hugh Halliday (drums) joined. Rather than change the name to Unit 6 (the obvious new name), they became Unit 4 + 2.Their music was a blend of folk, pop and rock'n'roll. Their first hit was The green fields, which just scraped into the British chart. The next single, Sorrow and pain, failed to chart at all. The real breakthrough came via their third single, the British chart-topper, Concrete and clay, which was also an American top thirty hit. The follow-up, You've never been in love like this before, was a British top twenty hit but only just got into the American chart. Ten more singles were released but none of them charted, during which time there were several personnel changes.This compilation includes all the hits and several of the A-sides that failed to chart - there were too many failures to include them all here. It also includes covers of Cotton fields, 500 miles, La bamba, You've lost that loving feeling and Swing down chariot - four different songs with very different origins.Unit 4 + 2 made some entertaining music, but history will record them as a one-hit wonder. This collection is for those (like me) who are deeply into sixties music and who want to explore its obscure backwaters. Excellent CD by an much underated 60's group.Contains tracks from their only 2 albums plus 6 selected bonus tracks of singles not otherwise included on albums.","Rock,Pop,British Invasion,Classic Rock",first let say im glad im person review since early let also say reviews helped judge cd poorly group might try stereo version next looks like us release much better list fan original mono original mixed way really terrible remastered stereo beatles cds lot mono punch thats unbeatable cd punch barely make fist one oddest collections released rock roll prime era concrete clay good best id recommend much lively eddie rambeau version covers karaoke best except girl ny city ive never fan mixing fully different genres one record r r leadbellys cotton fields miles swing chariot really ridiculous choice okay got system originals l let say im glad glad person review early let say reviews helped judge cd poorly group try stereo version looks release better list fan original original mixed way really terrible remastered stereo beatles cds lot punch unbeatable cd punch barely fist collections released rock roll prime era concrete clay good best recommend lively eddie eddie rambeau rambeau version covers karaoke best girl ny ny city city fan mixing fully different genres record cotton cotton fields fields miles swing chariot really ridiculous choice okay got system originals
43,69,B000000139,"Hearing some of their &#34;hits&#34; over time here and there, I expected a double album full of similar tunes.  Unfortunately, other than songs like Reasons to be Cheerfull Pt3, Hit me with your Rhythm Stick, Sex and Drugs and Rock n' Roll, and &#34;Superman's Big Sister&#34;, I didn't find much here I'm interested in..  A lot of spoken word, strange mixes, halting arrangements, really more of an art-rock poetry thing.  The above songs often really groove, but most of this just does not. Cette compilation est simplement incontournable. Si comme moi vous ne connaissiez que les classiques ""wake up and make love with me"", Sex & Drugs and Rock & Roll"", ""Reasons to be cheerful part 3"", alors r&eacute;jouissez vous, vous en aurez pour votre argent mais surtout pour votre plus grand plaisir. 36 morceaux qui d&eacute;filent &agrave; un rythme soutenu et une partie enregistr&eacute;e en public tout simplement exceptionnelle.Seul regret, ne pas les avoir d&eacute;couverts plus tt.Merci Monsieur Dury, merci les Blockheads. So unique and excellent. There was only ever one Ian Dury. Brilliant lyrics. Loads of tracks and a great live set. If you like Ian Dury this is a must have. loaded with tunes.you really get your money worth out of this long play. I prefer the live versions of these songs because they have more energy and are less canned sounding. Blending elements of sly English music-hall badinage, Noel Coward wit and wordplay, warm jazz, and disco rhythms into a genre entirely and irresistibly his own, veteran 1970s pub-rocker Ian Dury was the most  endearing musician to ever charm his way straight through your funny bone -  and into your heart. Whether singing of the public embarrassment resulting  from his youthful theft of a men's stroke magazine from a newsagent  (&quot;Razzle in My Pocket [A True Story]&quot;), the demands of a morning  hard-on (&quot;Wake Up and Make Love With Me&quot;), and the comic  possibilities lurking just beneath the surface of history's creative  geniuses (&quot;There Ain't Half Been Some Clever Bastards&quot;), or  rapping his way through the infectious dance beats of &quot;Reasons to Be  Cheerful, Pt. 3,&quot; Dury had an unerring sense that not only could being  naughty be great good fun, as well as an opportunity for verbal ingenuity -  it could also get you on your feet and moving when enlisted with just the  right dash of insouciant style. Favorite lyrics (from &quot;Reasons to Be  Cheerful, Pt. 3&quot;): &quot;`Einshtein' can't be classed as witless/He  said atoms are the littlest/When you do the bit o' split'liss/You frighten  everybody shitless...There ain't half been some clever bastards (Chorus:  &quot;Lucky Peters, Lucky Peters&quot;)/There ain't half been some clever  bas-tards...`Van Goff' did some eyeball pleazahs/He musta bean a pencil  squeezah/He didn't do the Mona Leezhah/That was an Italian geezah!...There  ain't half been some clever bastards...&quot; I envy the uninitiated -  you're about to wonder where Ian and his Blockheads have been all your  life, while discovering your own latest &quot;Reason to Be Cheerful (Pt.  3).&quot; &quot;Clever bastards,&quot; indeed! This is the Ian Dury compilation to buy if you haven't got all the original albums. All the brilliant singles are here, along with the best of the album tracks together with some wonderful bonus material (such as the Kilburn & the High Roads stuff).Dury was a marvellously witty and perceptive lyric writer, and whilst his distinctive cockney drawl was hardly a great singing voice, it marked him as someone who was doing something completely different from everybody else. The Blockheads of course were also a great band, and again this marked Ian Dury out from the rest of the punk/new wave movement.This is a fabulous complilation, and at the moment its very cheap for a double CD. It'll cost you more to download all these tracks (legally that is!). This 2-CD collection gathers not the best of Ian Dury solo, Ian Dury & the Blockheads, Kilburn & The High Roads (it's really Dury and friends too), Ian Dury & the Music Students, and 5 ""live"" tracks recorded ""live"" in London in 1990, just ten years before Dury's death.I gave a good review to the Landmark ""Sex & Drugs & Rock'n'Roll, Greatest Hits"" collection, but this collection tops it by containing several favorites not included on the Landmark set. The volume levels of the songs are better on this version as well. There's no real break between the first two songs on the Landmark collection either.So if it's a choice, I recommend this collection above the other by a long shot! It includes ""Spasticus Autisticus"", ""Billericay Dickie"", ""Pam's Moods"", ""There Ain't Half Been Some Clever Bastards,"" ""F##king Ada (my own censorship there), and many other songs not on the Landmark CDs. This one even spell's ""Superman's Big Sister"" correctly on the credits, whereas Landmark spells it ""Sueperman's Big Sister.""The liner notes reveal nothing, not even a photo of Dury, whereas this collection has a few notes and a few photos.And, as with the other collection, this one goes perfectly with the 2010 film bio of Dury, ""sex & drugs & rock'n'roll"". The star looks and sounds so much like Dury it is hard to tell them apart in your mind after a few minutes. Excellent film with an excellent, insightful and touching script, i.e., see it too! This is a very good collection, good eclectic music, I own the LPs for some of the content but loading the CD into iTunes was much simpler than recording from the LP, and I really wanted the music in my library.  Enjoy! It has all of my favorite songs on this cd. It is a type of cd you can listen to over and over again. good stuff but some how or another i remembered liking these songs better when they first came out. not sure of the arrangements now","Alternative Rock,New Wave & Post-Punk,British Punk,British Isles,Europe,Punk,Disco,Dance & Electronic,Britain,World Music,Rock,Hardcore & Punk",hearing hits time expected double full similar tunes unfortunately like reasons cheerfull pt hit rhythm stick sex drugs rock n roll supermans big sister didnt find much im interested lot spoken word strange mixes halting arrangements really art rock poetry thing often really groove cette compilation est simplement incontournable si comme moi vous ne connaissiez que les classiques wake make love sex drugs rock roll reasons cheerful part alors r eacute jouissez vous vous en aurez pour votre argent mais surtout pour votre plus grand plaisir morceaux qui eacute filent agrave un rythme soutenu et une partie enregistr eacute e en public tout simplement exceptionnelle seul regret ne pas les avoir eacute couverts plus tt merci monsieur dury merci les blockheads unique excellent hearing hits time expected double full similar tunes unfortunately reasons pt hit rhythm rhythm stick stick sex sex drugs drugs rock rock n roll roll supermans big sister sister find interested lot spoken spoken word word strange mixes halting arrangements really art rock rock poetry really groove compilation est si wake make love love sex sex drugs drugs rock roll reasons cheerful pour argent mais surtout pour grand public tout regret ne pas tt monsieur unique excellent

45,74,B00000019G,"This soundtrack contains really good examples of 80s California-style soundtrack music.  The instrumental stuff is scary and suggests robot attacks--really fits the movie well.  The stuff by Tahnee Cain and Tryanglz is classic California-style New Wave; think Missing Persons.  If you're an 80s synthesizer person, you'll love this soundtrack, both for the extra-creepy sci-fi sound of the score, and for the peep into 80s Cally-style New Wave. When Kyle and Sarah met for the first time? It goes something like &quot;You've got me buggin&quot; or something...plz help! I had this on cassette tape when I was a kid, and played the hell out of it. It's a bit dated today, but still inspired, and still gets my blood pumping. As a collector of 80s music, I got this soundtrack not for the score, but for the pop songs--particularly for the tracks by Tane Cain, who gets backed by a band called Tryanglz and has her first name spelled differently. And let let me say, her tracks are stronger than the stuff found on her one and only solo LP from 1982. These are true new wave gems, as are the two other tracks by Jay Ferguson and Linn Van Hek. Wow. These are the kind of songs that should have gotten airplay on popular new wave stations, but went unnoticed because of unfamiliar artist names. If you are a hardcore lover of 80s new wave, you do not want to miss this stuff. And also get your hands on the Revenge of the Nerds soundrack, another phenomenal new wave compilation by unknown acts. I did not realize how little of the actual soundtrack music was on the CD, I do not like anything from tracks 7 and on. It is junk! I wish I could return this CD, (How about it Amazon.com, what is your customer satisfacion  policy?) I am ordering the definitive edition based on reviews. Yeah well, it's ok. But i also agree with with the other one, the tracks  from 7 and on are not really my cup of the. But the other ones are great,  Terminator Arrival is cool and Factory Chase are my favourites. I would  give it 2,5  stars if it was possible...thoug i am a big fan of the movie  it does'nt catch. I will have to agree with everyone else - except the only tolerable songs are the theme, &quot;Love Scene&quot;, and &quot;Terminator Arrival&quot; and the last one isn't really a song.  The Theme along makes this worth  having if you only want that and the Love Scene is short but intense . . . Love The First 6 Songs On The Soundtrack But I Don't Like The Rest &quot;The Terminator&quot; Is A Hit! Love The Movie A Good Soundtrack Love The First 6 Songs But Don't Like The Rest The Terminator Is A Hit I Think The Terminator Was A Good Movie But I Don't Think The Soundtrack's that interesting The Best Songs Are 1-6 But The Best Is Song Number 1 The Soundtrack Didn't Come Out Right After The Movie But I Like The First 6 Songs On The Soundtrack Of course who could ever forget the two most remembered songs from Tech-noir?  They were &quot;Photoplay&quot; and &quot;Burnin' in the Third Degree,&quot; and were soo amazing!  (And they're both by the same group!)  A couple of songs that would give one a very good idea of the ever growing craze for MTV &amp; the decade of Music Videos!But every other song on this Soundtrack was wonderful as well!  Each song or theme applied to the movie in one way.  (Not like a song just being placed there, just for the hell of it.) I love this soundtrack it covers the movie so well.You can feel the power and emotion they are going though at that time.Their highs e.g:-4 Love Scene .You feel like you are thier in the action .Having the power the terminator did.Being afraid like Sarah.As strong as Kyle.I think this is a fantastic album. I love this soundtrack! Specialy songs, they're great!  My favourite are 8-11. This is the best movie soundtrack ever!  &quot;you've got me burnin'....you've got me burnin'...in the third degree&quot; - Tahnee Cain &amp; TryanglzIf you love 80's you must have it !!!! More incomplete soundtrack antics for fans.This is the original Terminator soundtrack disc containing part of Brad Fiedel's score plus all of the songs featured in the film.  So yes, the songs from Tech Noir are here (You've Got Me Burning, Photoplay) as well as the songs Gingers blasts through her boxy Walkman before Arnold interrupts the party.The score is low budget, synth-based, workmanlike, and very appropriate for the film.  The electronics fit the film perfectly even if it doesn't date well.  The main theme is the highlight, running over 4 minutes and is preferable to the opening theme from T2 (which is a shorter rehash).  It's got a slow build up, then starts pounding.  You'll also notice that the Terminator Arrival music is the same basic cue that plays whenever Arnold is on the screen (care theft, gun store, shooting the first Sarah, etc.)In the mid-1990s the Definitive Edition of the soundtrack was released, meaning just about all of Fiedel's score saw the light of day, including the intense music from the police station invasion, etc.  However, that 'definitive' edition didn't have any of the songs.The songs are kind of cheesy, very 80s, but fans of the film will appreciate them.  I'm sure James Cameron wanted to get higher profile artists, but they took what they could get and we're the better for it.Both discs are out of print now, but not difficult to come across.  For the Terminator fan, and the soundtrack fan, they're both recommended. A very good CD. Remember all that suspense in the movie ? Now you can get it in your own home... Liste to the DC and you'll get amazed ! What made me want to buy this CD is not only ""The Terminator Theme"" but the pop songs. I liked the scene in The Terminator movie when The Terminator walks into the Technoir Bar to find Sarah Conner. The picture moved in slow motion as the Terminator was approaching her and the song ""You Got Me Burnin'""(by Tahnee Cain, Tryanglz) was playing. When I saw the listings on Amazon, I thought ""I've got to hear that"".When I first listened to the ""The Terminator: Original Soundtrack"", I really liked the theme and all the rest of the instrumental songs. I also liked the pop rock songs on the CD so it's a good CD to purchase. As a hard core 80's fan, The Terminator is one of my favorite movies of all time. I always thought the soundtrack was wonderful, in fact the main theme is my favorite movie theme.  Buying this CD was worth every cent I paid.  It's unfortunate the tracks by Tahnee Cain and the Tryanglz etc are available only on the soundtrack, but this was a smart purchase. I was amazed at how fast it shipped, and in how good of a condition it came.  I bought a used CD, and was a bit nervous at first, thinking it would be scratched etc.  Far from it, it was in great condition, and I have had no issues with it. It feels good to finally have all the songs from the movie like Ginger's walkman song, and the songs from Tech Noir. They are a fantastic addition to my expanding 80's song collection.  I'm glad I bought this CD. Brad Fidel had an arsenal of cool analog gear at his disposal when he setup to make the music for the first Terminator.  The result was 45 minutes of unadulterated analog bliss. You'll hear Oberheim OB-Xa, SCI Prophet-10, Linndrum, DMX and Emulator noises all over this thing, and it was recorded back in the day when artists simply plugged in their gear and hit record. Just listen to the Police Station scene. That's nothin but OB-Xa pumpin out those sweet low end notes as the voices retrigger in different pan positions. The Terminator Arrival also features the OBXa holding down that haunting low D with a Prophet-10 providing the percussive pulse.Of course, you gotta love the music he wrote.  Future Remembered is simply genius. The main title rocks. People say the music sounds like dated 1980s cheese Let's hear it for the boy music. Well I say no way. No one ever complains that a grand piano sounds dated and that thing was made hundreds of years ago. So a phat monster analog gunship like the Prohet-10 sounds as fresh as a spring day in May in my book.  Great CD! Being more of fan of &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, I was never really interested in this soundtrack....

46,75,B0000001AK,"Arthur Lyman always does an excellent CD.  I have every single one and in many cases I love him more than Martin Denny although both are superb. This is a great addition to my collection. The Arthur Lyman Group brings a tropical vacation to wherever I play this CD. It is Tiki time. The Arthur Lyman Group produced some of the greatest lounge music of the 1950s and 1960s. This CD contains 18 tracks of very good music to show us why The Arthur Lyman Group achieved such popularity.The CD starts with ""Taboo."" The horns open up into a musical arrangement that highlights the percussion, guitar, piano and numerous other percussion instruments. The melody gathers steam; and the only thing I definitely didn't like was the bird sounds sprinkled throughout this number and other numbers on this CD. Otherwise ""Taboo"" proves to be a solid opener for this CD. ""Love For Sale"" is track number two; and the melody is so beautiful and infectiously catchy and upbeat that you will be stunned if you haven't heard this number before! The piano and percussion do a great job on ""Love For Sale."" How elegant!""Fascination"" begins with the xylophone and chimes. Other instruments then join in to make this an elegant, slow paced number. ""Fascination"" will make you want to grab your sweetheart and slow dance all around the living room! SMILES The piano comes in midway through ""Fascination"" which infuses this instrumental ballad with a continental flair all its own.""Hava Nagila"" is another catchy track on this CD. The flute and percussion carry the opening of the musical arrangement; and the melody overall is relentlessly happy and upbeat. When the piano and other instruments join in you'd better have plenty of space on your living room floor--you'll be dancing to this number, too!One especially elegant number on this CD would be ""Arrivederci Roma."" The percussion, piano and horns all combine to make this a memorable number with a singularly beautiful continental flair. The band members occasionally yell out a ""whoop!"" to let you know they're enjoying playing this number every bit as much as you're enjoying listening to it.""76 Trombones (From ""The Music Man"")"" opens strong with the piano, chimes and drums going strong on all cylinders. This rousing instrumental ballad shines and you will enjoy it thoroughly.The CD closes with the very pretty ""Maui Chimes."" Obviously, the chimes perform an integral part of the musical arrangement. They sound great when the ukulele comes in, too!  When the piano and other instruments are added to the arrangement the excitement only grows. However, this is the last track on this CD--now, where did I put The Best Of The Arthur Lyman Group, Volume Two?I highly recommend this CD for fans of mood music, lounge music and easy listening music, too. People who enjoy ""exotica"" music will love this CD as well. This has to be one of my favorite CD's of all time. Being born in '67 I was by all acounts, I child of New Wave with all that it came with good and bad so I had ZERO exposure to &quot;Tropical Jazz&quot; (for lack of a better term).Rummaging through my grandmother's albums, I came across &quot;Taboo&quot; and adored the cover right off the bat, it screamed of kitsch! Since her album was an original, it was full of pops and scratches galore. I went ahead and started my quest to purchase it on CD (this was about 5 years ago). Little did I know what an undertaking it would become. I finally found it under the EZ listening section, it wasn't &quot;Taboo&quot; but I thought it would do the trick.Once I put the CD in, it didn't come out for about 3 months. My roomate at the time thought I had completely lost my mind until one day, she asked if I could help her search for a copy of her own (she ended up with the calssic &quot;Taboo&quot;). We spent many a day cha-cha'ing and rhumba'ing around the house after that.The lounge/bachelor's den music craze started to hit about a two years later, and we were prepared if not considered hipster experts on the genre. And to think, this all started with what I considered to be kind of a kookie purchase!For the most part, the tracks are entertaining (Hava Nagila on the Xylophone is well worth the purchase in itself) and you can't help but feel like you are getting ready to pack your bags to fly to the Aloha State and be greeted by Elvis when you get off that plane. This is certainly one of the most enjoyable CD's you will ever own and to this day, I bust it out during the summer as well as to sunny up gloomy days! Wonderful collection of songs from the Arthur Lyman Group. Must have to your collection of exotico. There are three big names in the ""exotica"" genre of the 1950's tropical cocktail lounge/smooth jazz: Lyman, whose most popular song, ""Yellow Bird"" is not on this particular collection, and Martin Denny, whose big hit was ""Quiet Village"" and Les Baxter, who wrote ""Quiet Village."" The CD reissues, twofers, and remastered compilations are hard to find at present, and in demand in the auctions. This is a good set if you find it at a price you like. I rate it four instead of five, because I would have loved to have ""Yellow Bird"" and Lyman's version of ""Quiet Village"" put on here instead of ""March of the Siamese Children"" and ""Jungle Jalopy."" The two missing titles are on a follow-up collection, ""More Best of..."" on the same label. I paid what I consider a bargain price for my copy, and I am happy with it. It isn't something I'll play more than a few times a year...but as a person old enough to remember the original records, and also as a former resident of Hawaii, I just had to have something by Arthur in my collection. Back when I was in high school, I liked Martin Denny's work even better, but truly, each man has his gifts and subtle strengths. Bird calls, rain noises, lots of percussion from ""native"" instruments, vibes and guitars...this music is fun, yet mellow. True, after awhile one song begins to sound like another (which was probably a big factor in the downfall of the Exotica category in the first place) but there are weekends when you just might want to hear some tropical parrot sounds over some smooth jazz riffs, above a melody that is familiar from your childhood. This disc has nice sound quality and is not re-recorded...these selections were taken from the Arthur Lyman Group's original work in Honolulu and the original albums on the briefly famous ""Hi Fi"" label. The original LP album covers were frequently erotic, the sounds inside were exotic to Mainland Americans, yet not disturbing. Everyone who wants his or her collection to cover the highlights of post- WWII popular music will need at least one ""Exotica"" sample. This disc fills the bill quite nicely.","Pop,Easy Listening",arthur lyman always excellent cd every single one many cases love martin denny although superb great addition collection arthur lyman group brings tropical vacation wherever play cd tiki time arthur lyman group produced greatest lounge cd contains good show us arthur lyman group achieved popularity cd starts taboo horns open musical arrangement highlights percussion guitar piano numerous percussion instruments melody gathers steam thing definitely didnt like bird sounds sprinkled throughout number numbers cd otherwise taboo proves solid opener cd love sale number two melody beautiful infectiously catchy upbeat stunned havent heard number piano arthur lyman excellent cd single cases love martin denny denny superb great addition collection arthur lyman group brings tropical vacation play cd tiki time arthur lyman group produced greatest lounge cd contains good show arthur lyman group achieved popularity cd starts taboo horns open musical musical arrangement arrangement highlights percussion guitar piano numerous percussion percussion instruments instruments melody gathers steam definitely bird bird sounds sounds sprinkled number numbers cd taboo proves solid opener cd love sale number melody beautiful infectiously catchy upbeat stunned heard number piano

48,77,B0000001BN,"Gabor Szabo was a unique guitarist and fantastic musician whose sound is instantly recognizable once you hear his recordings.  Listen for the use of open strings both in melodic lines and as drones, controled feedback, up-picking where other guitarists would use a downstroke, and more.  This album does not contain his most creative work but demonstrates what a highly creative musician can do with some fairly ordinary pop tunes.  Sadly only a small portion of his work is available on CD and hence I've given this album 5 stars whereas in the galaxy of all his recordings, it would get fewer. This is one of Gabor's classic albums. Love his more exotic, drone pieces. Some of the pop tunes are okay as well.

50,79,B0000001BS,"As Frankie [Sinatra,like you didn't know!] sang, &quot;Hey there cutes, put on your dancin' boots&quot; and come dance with me, or your Mama if she happens to be home! Cal Tjader does it again, tango,cha cha, mambo, merenge, even that damn macarena, all Latin hip hop stirred to a brothy boil with huge portions of swing jazz.  An aside, few know Cal Tjader played piano terrifically, his wife Pat also was no slouch. Cal had a wonderful habit of hiring great pianist like, Vince Guaraldi who became famous later, but scorching swingers like Emanuel Duran, Lonnie Hewitt, Joe Kloess and here the fabulous Al Zulaica.  If you can find any records made by these guys-BUY IT!  If I could find any recordings I would.  A monster of an album. Cal was certainly plugged-in, turned-on and whatever other anachronistic expression is applicable in this case. The atmosphere is so thick, you can just feel it oozing off this recording into your room. One of the best club recording I've ever heard, this collection features Cal's trademark Latino-fusion, including some jazzified and latinized pop hits of the day, including Lady Madonna and Spooky. Armando Perrazza is there as well, adding Afro-Cuban feel, and together these guys lay on the chops really thick. But the album is more than just jazzy chop-fest - it's the vibe of a late 60's night gig at a Calfornia night-club that is almost tangible. Essential listening for Latin jazz fans and groovemeisters. Seeing as how nobody has reviewed this wonderful album, I felt compelled to put my two cents in. Cal Tjader was a beautiful musician concerned above all with attractive melodies and deep rhythms. He's often dismissed out of hand by many jazz fans, a shame since if they would just put their prejudices aside, they would find that he meant every note he played, no less so than Milt Jackson or Bobby Hutcherson. This album documents a 1969 live performance where Tjader and his band are in perfect synergy with all in attendance. Indeed, the audience occasionally breaks into spontaneous applause in mid-song just because the musicians are in such a sweet groove. The material ranges from Horace Silver's &quot;Nica's Dream&quot; to the Banana Splits theme (no joke!) and everything swings equally. This album has a glow to it that's hard to describe, the rhythms cook nicely while the sound of Tjader's vibes and Al Zulaica's electric piano totally mellow you out. It's infectious and positive and very well-recorded. Highly recommended! As a Cal Tjader fan for over 50 years, I found this album a delightful surprise. I didn't have it in my collection, and was very pleased with the set performed at the Lighthouse in Hermosa Beach in the 60s. I would recommend this to all Tjader afficionados. I was a public radio program director and a friend of Cal's back in the 70s and 80s, and we all lost a wonderful musician and great-hearted person when he passed too soon. This set is great!Katie SloanEugene, OR The 8 live tracks on this rare CD are from a live session which is also on the album ""Latin + Jazz = Cal Tjader"", available as a CD and as an Amazon downloadLatin + Jazz = Cal Tjader.","Cuba,Jazz,Latin Pop,Modern Postbebop,Latin Music,Pop,World Music,Latin Jazz,Bebop,Caribbean & Cuba,Cool Jazz",frankie sinatra like didnt know sang quot hey cutes put dancin boots quot come dance mama happens home cal tjader tango cha cha mambo merenge even damn macarena latin hip hop stirred brothy boil huge portions swing jazz aside know cal tjader played piano terrifically wife pat also slouch cal wonderful habit hiring great pianist like vince guaraldi became famous later scorching swingers like emanuel duran lonnie hewitt joe kloess fabulous al zulaica find records made guys buy could find recordings would monster cal certainly plugged turned whatever anachronistic expression applicable case atmosphere thick feel oozing recording room one best club recording ive ever heard collection features cals trademark latino fu sinatra know sang quot hey cutes boots come dance mama happens home cal tjader tango cha cha mambo damn macarena latin latin hip hop hip hip hop hop stirred brothy boil huge portions swing swing jazz jazz aside know cal tjader played piano terrifically wife pat slouch wonderful habit hiring great pianist vince vince guaraldi guaraldi famous later scorching swingers emanuel hewitt joe fabulous al find records guys buy find recordings monster certainly plugged turned anachronistic expression applicable case atmosphere thick feel oozing recording recording room room room one best club recording heard collection features cals trademark latino fu
51,80,B0000001BW,"My favorite Annie Ross album is out-of-print: A Swinger, with Zoot Simms. That said, this isn't too bad. She doesn't hit it out of the park, but the arrangements and orchestration are fine. With limited vocal range, Annie depends on emotional impact to win you over. Her best stuff is out-of-print, though, alas.

Not one of her best, but still not too bad, but again an artist like Keely Smith would have sounded better with the songs and arrangements on this CD. This lp places Annie Ross in a lush 60's setting with full orchestration.  More pop oriented than her previous solo recordings with Gerry Mulligan or Zoot Sims, but still pretty jazzy.

52,82,B0000001DY,"Yes, this album is very hard to find, but once you do, it was well worth the effort and the money.  I found my copy upon its release over 20 years ago at the old Rose Records shop in Chicago, a couple of years after I finally heard the Velvet Underground and Nico for the first time (1987), and I love it to this day.  Two tracks stand out:  ""Hey Mersh"" and ""Work"".  The former track opens with Mo yelling ""Hey, Mersh, let's go to the mall"", which was kind of scary considering my then-blossoming aversion to shopping malls.  They were ""the place to be"" back in the late 70's and some time into the early 80's, but by the end of that decade, I had just about had it with them.  ""Work"" is still as relevant now as it was then, with lyrics telling it like it is when it comes to long hours and low pay - this is leaps and bounds over anything Bruce Springsteen and Styx had to say on the subject.  You do, of course, remember that horrible song, ""Blue Collar Man"".  Tommy Shaw was a multimillionaire ""rollin' in the dough"" at the time the song was released.  What in God's name did he know about struggle?  Mo says it best, and it's set at a frenetic tempo with drums and guitars that sound as angry as the singer, and possibly as much as the record buyer listening to this track.  She touches on such subjects as problems in the free-lunch program for public schools, rising utility bills and high deductions from paychecks: ""My kids don't get a free lunch at the school they go...Gotta pay the lights - I GOTTA PAY THE PHONE!!!!!""  The refrain, of course, says it all ""WHEN I GET MY CHECK I KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG...OH! SOMETHING'S WRONG!!!""There are also nice covers of ""Goodnight Irene"" and Lou Reed's own ""Pale Blue Eyes"", and Mo actually wrote most of the other songs on the album, including ""Mersh"" and ""Work"".Get this if you can - PLEASE!Recorded with help from Reed, as well as Sonic Youth's Lee Renaldo, Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore, this is a true punk masterpiece. This is one of the first records that Moe Tucker made after returning to music from her time spent as a wife and mother, and also working for the Wal Mart corporation.  From 1989, it is still early enough to have been influential to the indie movement that began in the 1990s.  It is also worth seeking out because Moe assembled a supporting cast including Lou Reed, Sonic Youth, Jad Fair and others.  I enjoy this record, although I wouldn't rate it as an essential 5 star recording, it is excellent and entertaining.  Moe Tucker's vocals are not going to astound anyone with their flawless technique, nonetheless, her singing is unique and charming.  Anyone who knows the VU song ""Afterhours"" can understand.  Most of the songs on this LP are a blend of poppy, bluesy, lo-fi rock n' roll.  Listening to the record, I found it easier to see the link between the Velvet Underground and early rock n' roll.  Lou Reed always struck me as a fan of Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry and do wop music, while John Cale was responsible for the Velvet's artiness and Nico for their more exotic feel.  This record also helped to illustrate the progression from the Velvet Underground to later bands that they influenced, from Modern Lovers and Big Star to later lo-fi indie groups.  The covers are enjoyable as well as the originals.  ""Pale Blue Eyes"" has a dreamier, ethereal quality compared to the Velvet Underground, while ""Bo Diddley"" bounces along with a primal, punk rock energy.  This album, along with Moe Tucker's other solo recordings, isn't very well known, but deserves a wider audience. Should be 4 stars""What ever happened to Maureen Tucker"" You ask yourself that every day. Well ask no longer. Maureen is alive and kicking and still creating music. ""Life in Exile After Abdication"" is a great solo record put out by Ms. Tucker and it is also alive and kicking. While it's not a continuation of the VU sound, it has a lo-fi crunchiness all its own.I've only heard it on a cassette at a time where I stored them on the floor of my bug sans case so the sound quality was pretty poor but it still had kick to it. Who knew Maureen had this kind of energy bottled up in her. Kind of a quasi punk meets blues minimalist (hey, I ain't no professional music critic hack). If you can find it, you won't be disappointed. with artists like Lou Reed and the members of Sonic Youth aiding in this album, it should be the best album ever.  It isn't but it's still good.  I have it on a record I got from my dad.  It's amazing.","Alternative Rock,New Wave & Post-Punk,Pop,Post-Punk,Rock,Hardcore & Punk",yes hard find well worth effort money found copy upon release years ago old rose records shop chicago couple years finally heard velvet underground nico first time love day two stand hey mersh work former opens mo yelling hey mersh lets go mall kind scary considering blossoming aversion shopping malls place back late time early end decade work still relevant lyrics telling like comes long hours low pay leaps bounds anything bruce springsteen styx say subject course remember horrible blue collar man tommy shaw multimillionaire rollin dough time released g hard find worth effort money found copy release years old rose records shop chicago couple years finally heard velvet velvet underground underground nico time love love day day stand hey work opens mo yelling hey mersh lets mall kind scary considering blossoming aversion shopping shopping malls malls place late time early end decade work relevant lyrics telling comes long hours low low pay pay leaps bounds bruce springsteen springsteen say subject course remember horrible blue blue collar blue collar man collar man tommy shaw rollin dough time time released released

54,85,B0000001F9,"This review has been used to cover several Lightning Hopkins CDs and a DVD review of an instructional film, ""The Guitar Of Lightnin' Hopkins"", directed and taught by Ernie Hopkins, Stephan Grossman Studio Workshop, 2004, on learning his guitar style. I might add that this film makes abundantly clear that learning Lightning's eccentric style is definitely not for beginners. Go to the Willie Dixon song book for that.Lightnin'!, Lightning Hopkins, Arhoolie Records, 1993Free Form Patterns, Lightning Hopkins, Fuel 2000 Records, 2003Blue Lightning, Lightning Hopkins, Paula Records, 1995Lightning Hopkins & The Blues Summit, Lightning Hopkins, Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, Big Joe Williams, EMI-Capitol Records, 2001I have spilled plenty of ink in this space tracing the main line of the blues from its acoustic origins down in the plantation South up river through the way station of Memphis and then to the electric ""Mecca of Chicago. Along the way I have occasionally mentioned some of the other branches of the blues line like the North Carolina pick. I have not spent nearly enough time on some of the other important branches of the blues expansion, especially in the post World II period such as the West Coast blues and, as will be noted here, Texas blues.If the blues is synonymous with the black struggle to get by day to day, to make ends meet and to make it to Saturday night and some relieve then the very big locale of Texas and its harsh hard scrabble life and strict Jim Crow laws hardly seems out of place as a key blues outpost. From the days, in the 1920's and 1930's, of Blind Lemon Jefferson working the streets of rural small town Texas, cup in hand, up to the artist under review, Lightning Hopkins, working the small black clubs and ""juke joints"" of the cities (like Houston) and beyond to the sounds of blues revivalists like Stevie Ray Vaughn and his brother there has been more than enough misery to create a separate Texas blues tradition.Moreover, Brother Hopkins brings a distinctive guitar pick of his own to the ""dance"". He is famous, above all,  for what is called the E shuffle sound as he works the guitar to create a sound that is a little ""happier"" than the forlorn one of the Delta or the ""amped up"" one of Chicago. I, unfortunately, did not get a chance to hears Lightning live until late in his career in the early 1970's when he had lost a little of his fine-toned edge. One can recapture some of that though through some of these earlier recordings from a tie when he was in full blown Lightning form. Listen up if you want to learn a different way to run a guitar from that of Muddy Waters, Bukka White, B.B. King or, for that matter, Eric ClaptonNeedless to say Lightning had covered most of the known blues classics of his time as well as his own material. The borderlines of what is one's own material and what one has reworked from the blues pool is not always clear but you need to hear, for starters, ""Mojo Hand"", ""Hello Central"", ""Little Girl"" and ""Rock Me Baby"" to get a feel for his sound. Add on such classics as ""Wig Wearing Woman"", ""Lonesome Dog Blues"" (with an eerie dog bark included free), ""Back Door Friend"" and you are ready to become an aficionado. Throw in the talking blues-styled ""Mr. Charlie"", ""Baby Child"" and ""Cooking Done"" for good measure.  Finally, team up Lightning with the likes of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and the amazing Big Joe Williams (especially on Hopkins' ""Ain't Nothing Like Whiskey"" and ""Chain Gang Blues"") at the famous 1960 ""blues summit"" and you are ready for the graduate course. Sam ""Lightning"" Hopkins (!912-1982) was raised in east Texas and performed mainly in the Houston area during most of his career.  He was known to play in neighborhood taverns for a little cash.  He recorded some sides in Houston in the 1940s and 50s1946-1951, and was finally tracked down by Sam Charters and Chris Strachwitz in 1959.  It was the former who convinced Hopkins to go to New York City to produce a studio recording, and from there he toured some in the United States and Europe.  His playing style in recording studios and on tour did not have the flavor of the taverns with the neighborhood audience interaction (something that can be said for most musicians starting out in local clubs), but he has a smooth, soft vocal style compared to the shouting style of some other early bluesmen.  This CD represents recordings he made in the 1960s.  Many are the slower Texas country blues, as opposed to the jazzy modern blues many performers had adopted in the 60s.  The tracks on the CD were recorded in Houston, Texas, and Berkeley, California, and are from previously released Arhoolie recordings.  All songs have Lightning Hopkins, vocal and guitar.  Total playing time is over an hour.  They include:1.  Once was a Gambler (1961, in Berkeley) with Geno Landry (bass) and Victor Leonard (drums).2.  Meet You At The Chicken Shack (1962, in Houston) with Spider Kilpatrick (drums) is a jazzier, boogie style with considerable instrumental.3.  Bald Headed Woman (1961, in Berkeley) with Geno Landry (bass) and Victor Leonard (drums).tracks 4 to 9 were recorded in Houston in 1967.4.  Tom Moore Blues (Tom Moore was the owner of a large plantation).5.  Watch My Fingers (jazzier and mainly instrumental).6.  Love Like A Hydrant7.  Slavery Time8.

It's pleasant, the vocals are okay, the guitar playing steady, but compared with his early work on Aladdin, Modern, and especially Gold Star, it's mediocre.Age and the limitations of blues singing and playing are, of course, a factor, but Lightning had become a &#34;star&#34; by the time this CD was recorded and that's probably the major reason he phoned in most of these performances rather than singing and playing as well as he was capable of doing.Buy the Gold Star sides released on two CDs on Arhoolie, the same label, and you'll hear Lighting as he should be heard.  Avoid this one unless you're a Lighting completist (alas, my fate). Sam Lightnin' Hopkins is my favorite blues artist and if there's one album I own to explain why this would be it.

56,89,B0000001GF,"Booker T. Washington ""Bukka"" White (1906 - 1977), from Houston, Mississippi,  was another bluesman who seemed to drop out of sight during the Great Depression when recording companies were closing their doors.  Like many bluesmen from Mississippi, he spent a little time at the Parchman Farm after getting into some trouble.  He was tracked down by John Fahey, a student of country blues, in 1963 when Bukka was with his younger cousin, B.B. King, in Memphis.  Bukka went to California in 1963, partly at the invitation of Fahey, and partly to see his cousin who was playing in Oakland at that time.  He restarted his career, playing in coffee houses and such, and recording for Arhoolie Productions.  He played in coffeehouse (or juke joint) style, playing longer pieces that he improvised from performance to performance.  Like some other bluesmen, he played both guitar and piano.  Total playing time on this CD is 64:10, including brief pauses between songs, and the seven tracks are:1.  Bald Eagle Train (about his train trip to California) - Bukka White (some talking, some singing) with Big Willie Wayne on Washboard (simulating the train).2.  Single Man Blues - Bukka White (vocal and piano)3.  Georgia Skin Game - Bukka While (vocal and guitar)4.  Jesus Died on the Cross to Save the World - Bukka White (vocal and guitar)5.  Sugar Hill - Bukka White (vocal and jazzy piano).6.  My Baby - Bukka White (vocal and guitar).7.  Alabama Blues - Bukka White (vocal and guitar) with Big Willie Wayne on washboardOther recordings includeComplete Bukka White,Aberdeen Mississippi Blues,Parchman Farm Blues, etc.  He is also included in the recordings of some blues festivalsStars Of The 1969-1970 Memphis Country Blues Festival LP, but those may not be available at this writing on CDs.For further information see Bukka White, or for a history of Mississippi bluesmen from the 1920s and 1930s seeDelta Blues: The Life and Times of the Mississippi Masters Who Revolutionized American Music.","Pop,Slide Guitar,Regional Blues,Acoustic Blues,Traditional Blues,Blues,Delta Blues,Vocal Blues",booker washington bukka white houston mississippi another bluesman seemed drop sight great depression recording companies closing doors like many bluesmen mississippi spent little time parchman farm getting trouble tracked john fahey student country blues bukka younger cousin b b king memphis bukka went california partly invitation fahey partly see cousin playing oakland time restarted career playing coffee houses recording arhoolie productions played coffeehouse juke joint style playing longer pieces improvised performance performance like bluesmen played guitar piano total playing time cd including brief pauses seven bald eagle train train trip california bukka white talking booker booker washington washington bukka white white bluesman seemed drop sight great great depression depression recording recording companies companies closing doors bluesmen spent little time time parchman farm trouble tracked john john fahey student country country blues blues younger cousin b b king king california partly invitation fahey partly see cousin playing time restarted career playing coffee coffee houses houses recording productions played coffeehouse juke juke joint joint style playing pieces improvised performance performance bluesmen played guitar piano total playing playing time time cd including brief pauses bald bald eagle eagle train train trip california bukka white white talking
57,90,B0000001GH,"This a great collection of Earl Hooker recordings from the early sixties as well as a few songs recorded in the mid fifties. Earl is so smooth and clean with his slide. Nobody sounds like him, he's a one-of-a-kind. Unfortunately there just isn't that much Earl Hooker material available. Can't get enough of the Hook! Earl Hooker is a master of the wah pedal and slide.  Noone has found a way to get a sound like his in all the years I've been listening to the blues.  This album is a must have for any blues collector. The liner notes call his playing ""tasteful,"" that sounds a little wimpy, but that's not a bad assessment - he not only nails every note, but his phrasing goes beyond what is often all-to-predictable from the Chicago blues sound of the 1960s. As others have noted, EH was the master of the wah pedal; what the guy could do was incredible. How much of this song selection was played with a slide is difficult to figure; there are only a few phrases that sound slide-like, 99% of the rest sounds finger style. Could have been played with slide, but if so his precision in nailing notes is pretty mind blowing. Recording quality is, with one or two exceptions, excellent, so one can appreciate the guy's huge tone. Too bad the body of his recorded work is rather small and that he passed at a young age from TB, but some of his genius has been passed down to us through players influenced by him, Jimi among others. Apparenly he could play all styles of music, and even did a five-month gig at some redneck bar playing country and western. CD is a real gem. As Hooker was a sideman most of his career, he never received the sort of attention that people like T-Bone Walker, and BB King got, but he was probably the best technical blues guitarist of all time. His slide technique was incredible.  Well worth listening to. Earl Hooker unfortunately didn't live long enough to get his due.I believe this is his last recording with a few older classic tracks added on.This showcases his tasty and  restrained or intelligent use of a wah wah pedal.Good crisp recording - for anyone that appreciates the blues.He was really peaking as his health was failing.R.I.P. Earl Earl Hooker's great guitar playing shines through on this recording. The  &quot;Bug&quot; is Earl's reference to his bout with TB, which almost  killed him.Earl's an incredibly versatile player and this recording  highlights the spectrum of his playing. In a 1970's interview, BB King  listed Earl Hooker as one his favorite players, and offered the following  analogy - &quot;If Earl Hooker was a truck driver, he'd be able to back his  rig into any space, no matter how tight...&quot;By the way... when Jimi  Hendrix went to Chicago early in his career he played back-up for Earl  &amp; learned alot about how to use a wah-wah.... Listen closely and you'll  hear Earl tearing off several riffs that later became parts of Jimi's  sound. The late great Earl Hooker was a second cousing to John Lee Hooker and a guitar player's guitar player, beloved by Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy, and many other great guitarists, yet these days he's largely forgotten, having died in 1970 of tuberculosis at age 40.But this record, his most famous, tells a story of a virtuoso who had mastered every technique in the book. Backed by other excellent musicians, Hooker is absolutely mezmerizing on such cuts as ""You Don't Love Me,"" ""Off The Hook,"" ""Sweet Black Angel,"" and the title cut, a terribly poignant foreshadowing of Hooker's fatal illness.This record is one that blues fnas will enjoy over and over again.","Chicago Blues,Pop,Slide Guitar,Electric Blues,R&B,Regional Blues,Blues",great collection earl hooker recordings early sixties well recorded mid fifties earl smooth clean slide nobody sounds like hes one kind unfortunately isnt much earl hooker material available cant get enough hook earl hooker master wah pedal slide noone found way get sound like years ive listening blues must blues collector liner notes call playing tasteful sounds little wimpy thats bad assessment nails every note phrasing goes beyond often predictable chicago blues sound others noted eh master wah pedal guy could incredible much selection played slide difficult figure phrases sound slide like rest sounds finger style could great collection earl earl hooker recordings early sixties recorded mid mid fifties fifties smooth clean slide sounds kind unfortunately earl earl hooker material available hook earl hooker master wah wah pedal pedal slide found way sound years listening blues blues collector liner liner notes notes call playing tasteful sounds wimpy bad assessment nails note phrasing predictable chicago chicago blues blues sound noted master wah wah pedal pedal guy incredible selection played slide difficult figure phrases sound slide rest sounds finger style

60,94,B0000001I2,"Well, it is about time that I started to review some of the work of the good old boys and girls from the bayous down in Cajun country.  Places like Lafayette and Lake Charles evoke memories of time and place in Cajun musical history. You know at the edges of the places where the likes of Hank Williams and Jerry Lee Lewis learned their crafts. And places where all kinds of mixes of music and races blended to form unique sounds all their own. Accordions, washboards, fiddles, guitars and what ever came to hand on those whiskey-drenched Saturday nights.And on those nights come names like Clifton Chenier and Booboo Chavis that form the black influenced strand of the music. The Hackberry Ramblers and the likes of Waylon Thibodeaux form another, the good old white boys.  French Acadian exiles, English ""swamp foxes"" of undetermined origin, black escaped slaves, ""poor white trash""- it is all there mixed in one form or another. For the most part there were no serious conscious attempts to mix the strands but how could the intermixing influences be avoided in that small isolated area of southwest Louisiana.  And all under the umbrella of what I call the ""French blues"". Get your dancing slippers on.The roots of Cajun music go back a long way, probably as far back as the time of the expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia and the forced trek to Louisiana made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's ""Evangeline"". This CD tracks those origins and brings the story up to modern times. As always with an Arhoolie product there are copious liner notes to help fill in the story. Unlike other Cajun CDs I have reviewed in this space like those of the Hackberry Ramblers, this one has many early Acadia pieces that are untouched, or barely touched, by other musical influences. These tunes are similar in simplicity to the music of other isolated regions of America like the Appalachian Mountains. Fiddle, a bass, maybe a drum but some just have that pure, lonesome fiddle. Feast on ""Mes Souliers Sont Rouges"", ""Contredanse Francaise"", `Y Avait Boitine Boiteuse"", ""Aux Natchitoches"" and ""Contredanse De Mamou"" in the middle of this CD to see what I mean. Raw and ready, this is a must have for French country music lovers.  Less polished than the current artists so it has a different energy.  I think it's a little more foot-stomping than NPR-friendly French country music.I'm not taking anything away from the current crop of performers because, let's face it, trying to make a living at this kind of music means it's a labor of love. The money sure isn't there. I first heard this album a few years back (checked it out from the library) and I liked it enough that I kept looking for it until I rediscovered and ordered it. In my opinion, an important contribution to American music was captured in these recordings. Generally, the music is a lot of fun and gives me the feeling of hanging out in a dance hall with a bunch of somewhat drunk neighbors and friends having a party.","Pop,Traditional Folk,Cajun & Zydeco,Regional Blues,World Music,Blues,Folk",well time started review work good old boys girls bayous cajun country places like lafayette lake charles evoke memories time place cajun musical history know edges places likes hank williams jerry lee lewis learned crafts places kinds mixes races blended form unique sounds accordions washboards fiddles guitars ever came hand whiskey drenched saturday nights nights come names like clifton chenier booboo chavis form black influenced strand hackberry ramblers likes waylon thibodeaux form another good old white boys french acadian exiles english swamp foxes undetermined origin black escaped slaves poor white trash mixed one form another part serious conscious attempts mix strands coul time started review work good good old good old boys old old boys boys girls cajun cajun country country places lafayette lake evoke memories time time place place cajun musical musical history history know edges places likes hank hank williams williams jerry lee jerry lee lewis lewis learned crafts places kinds mixes races blended form unique sounds accordions washboards fiddles guitars came hand whiskey drenched saturday nights nights come names clifton chenier chenier form black influenced strand hackberry hackberry ramblers ramblers likes waylon thibodeaux form good good old old white white boys boys french acadian exiles english swamp swamp foxes foxes undetermined origin black escaped escaped slaves slaves poor poor white trash white white trash trash mixed form conscious attempts mix strands

Great, great stuff, and more of his 12-string playing than you can hear elsewhere. Robert Pete Williams is simply mesmerizing. His music is very difficult to classify and could not sound more different from the music of other Country Blues stars of the '60s, such as Son House or Bukka White. Instead, he is much closer to Skip James, not in terms of musical facets, but in terms of the deadening effect that he has upon the listener. Time seems to stand still when listening to both musicians. Unlike Skip, his lyrics seem to be improvised, often do not rhyme, and he regularly repeats a gripping line in many of his songs, about God having mercy on his soul. From the opening moments of the stark ""Pardon Denied Again"" to the happiness of ""Two Wings"", this is an album that is highly worth owning.

68,104,B0000001K9,"I have been an exuberant fan of Cajun music for years, and I eagerly purchased this CD because I find live music, especially of the Cajun variety, to be a lot more fun to listen to than the studio recordings.  This is a great CD, but I wish the Savoys and Michael Doucet had handed their bass player an acoustic base fiddle instead of letting him play his electric bass. The booming bass notes totally drown out Mrs. Savoy's guitar playing so that all you hear is the fiddle, accordion, and the woofey bass.  It's very disconcerting, especially on the first cut. I'll try to be brief. Most people I know either really like or really can't stand Cajun. I have not found a lot of middle ground.ME ? I love it. It sings, it's a trip all it's own. If you like Cajun as I do then you will love this. Ann Savoy is great, The guys know their music. Really can't say more. Buy this album. Heard a cut on a local college station and liked enough to order the cd. Great classic cajun, phenomenal musicianship and enjoy hearing a female vocalist for a change. Unfortunately the disc came damaged alltho amazon made it exceedingly easy to return. The album/CD was delivered on time and in one piece.  What more can you ask for?

71,107,B0000001LD,"Beausoleil is a great cajun band.  If you like this type of music, they are excellent. One of the best albums i bought in long time Makes me want to go to cajun country to experience cajun living 1st hand ! BeauSoleil's music has you tapping your toes, then getting up to move to their music! Love the vocals, love the instrumentals!  They are just fantastic! This IS the Best of BeauSoleil! If THIS tells you anything, I owned this CD up until last summer when I lost it ... I simply HAVE to have it back (it's felt like a part of me has been missing!!) and so just completed my order here on-line.Considering I have been born and raised here in Wisconsin (about as far away from the bayous of LA as you can get!), this must say something for this band and their incredibly rich sound with roots buried deep into Acadian (&lt;&lt; Cajun) heritage.I've listened to dozens of other cajun bands, and have purchased several ""Zydeco"" CD collections, but none compare with Beausoleil.If you're looking for a real cultural ""shift"" (even if it's just in your car on your way to work!), then this is the one to buy.aaayyyYYYIIEEEEE!!! my son ordered this for a friend and the friend liked it so that is all that matters isn't it Living in south Louisiana affords me the luxury of being exposed to a vast array of awesome Cajun bands.  I have several bands that I'll see at the drop of a crawfish, but BeauSoleil is and always will be my favorite.  I've been to concerts throughout the region from Lafayette to New Orleans and the music and performances are outstanding.This is a smashing collection of both vocal and instrumental compositions from a group of very talented, energetic and honed musicians.  Michael Doucet is a standout who has produced solo projects, although his best work is with the band singin' and fiddlin' and passing a good time- especially on stage.BeauSoleil has been on the Cajun music scene, to my knowledge, since the early '70s.  Unlike Zydeco and fusion bands, they play a more traditional form of Cajun music that has been 'instrumental' in preserving the Acadian heritage of Louisiana in that most of the songs are sung in Cajun French.This CD is well worth the price for a truly uplifting experience of great Cajun music. I own everything that Michael Doucet and Beausoleil have put out, but this compilation CD is special. Everything on here is wonderful, but the beautiful ballads such as ""Mercredi Soir Passe and ""Si J'aurais des Ailes"" are breathtaking! I agree with the other reviewer that Michael Doucet is the best in any genre. His voice is so beautiful, thats why I've been listening to Beausoleil for years and could never stop. Yes! I didn't think, that is to say, that I was a Cajun fan until I heard  Beausoleil. They must be counted among the most exciting groups making  music today, from any genre. Michael Doucet is absolutely a crazy man with  his fiddle, when the mood takes them, and the drive of their rhythmic  rapport is truly remarkable when Beausoleil is at their best. Of course,  this album is put together to showcase exactly that. There are  instrumentals as well as vocal performances, and I would guarantee that  they lift the spirits and move the feet. Really enjoy authentic music from different parts of the country. Just what I wanted.  Had heard a similar group.  Wanted to hear the best! Recommended by a friend. If you like Zydeco...this is a great album. This is good dance music and great listening. This is on of my fathers favorite cds, have bought it 3 times. We always end up giving it to a relative or friend because they also like. If you like coonass music you'll love this. Very good music and very good service - this is the 2nd time I have been asked to give a review for this item.","Cajun & Zydeco,Blues,World Music,Regional Blues,Pop",beausoleil great cajun band like type excellent one best bought long time makes want go cajun country experience cajun living st hand beausoleils tapping toes getting move love vocals love instrumentals fantastic best beausoleil tells anything owned cd last summer lost simply back felt like part missing completed order line considering born raised wisconsin far away bayous la get must say something band incredibly rich sound roots buried deep acadian lt lt cajun heritage ive listened dozens cajun bands purchased several zydeco cd collections none compare beausoleil youre looking real cultural shift even beausoleil great cajun band type excellent best bought long long time time want cajun cajun country country experience cajun living hand beausoleils tapping toes love vocals love instrumentals fantastic best beausoleil tells owned cd summer lost simply felt felt like missing completed order line considering born raised far away say band incredibly rich sound roots buried deep acadian cajun heritage listened dozens cajun bands purchased zydeco cd collections compare beausoleil youre looking real cultural shift
72,116,B0000001PV,"Lee Ritenour is one of the smoothest, cleanest playing guitarists that's ever picked up the instrument! I first heard this album, on vynyl, back in 1983. As a then rock fan, I was totally surprised that I enjoyed it, but Lee's clean crisp sound, speed and edge touched a nerve. Since that time, I've acquired many of his recordings and seen him live several times.&quot;On The Line&quot; is an in-studio concert. Seriously, read the liner notes! Lee fills the recording with big contemporary jazz names including Dave and Don Grusin on keyboards, Anthony Jackson and Nathan East sharing bass duties, and Ernie Watts on sax. This group then plays the entire set live, direct-to-disc.&quot;The Rit Variations&quot; opens the album with a mid-tempo, electric-classical musing. Nice basswork by Jackson and punchy lines by Rit give certain sections an Al Dimeola/flamenco feel. Next Lee drops a mellow tune in your lap, full of nice Watts sax work. The title cut is an upbeat number with a lot of funky keyboard and Mason's driving drums. Listen to Rit's raspy-toned solo beginning at the 2:15 mark. &quot;Tush&quot; comes back with a soft pulse. Especially sweet are the sections where Lee and Ernie play over the top of each other. Nathan East jumps headlong into cut five, a bouncy tune which exemplifies Rit's clean style...no matter the style, speed or tone....every note is crisp and clear. &quot;Heavenly Bodies&quot; contains a wide range of dynamics and sounds as though it should be part of a movie soundtrack, with the Grusins on board, who knows. Rit fuzzes up the third minute with a floating solo. I'm not so sure about the tune &quot;Pedestrian&quot;, the wierd synth/keyboard sound wears on me after a minute or two...you'll have to make the call. Lee finishes the album off with the thoughtful &quot;Dolphin Dreams&quot;. Again his soft, sweet lines and Watts' flowing sax create the proper mood. Rit turns up intensity slightly for the soaring central solo and then drops it back down to Watts, before easing us out with a soothing end.The album is a mixture of slow balladry, smooth-jazzy contemporary styling and a couple of thumping numbers that will have you trying to anticipate what the band will do next. This is a &quot;must have&quot; for any true Rit fan. I've been listening to it for seventeen years and it's still in my rotation. No wonder they call the man - Captain Fingers! Chris Teen makes some great comments on the musicianship and content of the disc.  Problem is, I bought the original cassette tape (also &quot;direct&quot; to tape) in 1984 after my best friend played the LP for me.  Some of the fundamental cuts are significantly different on this CD, and not as good.  The original tape has much more spontaneity and musical interest in the solo work.  The slower more meditative cuts are the same, but the real movers are really different.  The CD also re-orders the tracks, so it bothers these old ears.  A remaster of the tape would be much more interesting to me, but I have not found one. This purchase was worth it. Everything came out perfect. I love Ritenour, his music, etc. I'm very satisfied! No problems at all. In this production by the great guitarist Lee Ritenour made in 1983, we can appreciate the great professionalism and talent of this great American musician. Neatness in solos, excellent arrangements (as in the theme 'The Rit Variations') and great sound.Highlights of the single great Ernie Watts, another great saxophonist.An excellent cd for all good music lover of modern jazz. I lived in Albuquerque NM when I first heard this album.  Dolphin Dreams reminds me of the view I saw from the Sandia Mountains.  Mellow and soothing. This album is an old favourite of mine from way back,in my late teens,and which I still enjoy and play often.I bought the tape version in 1986,and I would love to buy the cd,but going by the first review of the cd version,I won't be buying it anytime soon.It sounds like its been remixed,and the song list reordered,which ruins the sound and flow of the album,and thats a shame.I want to know,why can't they just re-release the album on cd as it was originally recorded without messing around with it?.I had a disappointing experience with buying Lee Ritenours' ""Rio"" album on cd,having had it on record for many years.The record version is absolutely beautiful,lovely soft, romantic brazillian percussion,and fine finger work by Lee,and a brilliant song list that makes you feel like you have listened to a story.The cd version totally rips the guts out of it,and with a terrible song sequence.Just awful.I do NOT recommend it.My advice to loyal Ritenour fans,think twice about up dating your old records/tapes to cd.I taped my old Rio album,and thats what I play,rather than wearing out the record.But...I have seen, once, a long time ago,the cd version of ""On the Line"" but with the original cover (from the original 1983 album),I wonder whether it stuck to the original format...never got the chance to actually hear it,and find out.""On the Line"" is a  classic Ritenour album,my favourites would be Rit variations,Dolphin Dreams,California Roll,On the Line and Tush.I highly recommend it.If you can find a GOOD used record/tape of ""On the Line"",I strongly advise sticking with that.Or even better yet,if your a computer whiz,transfer the album on to cd via the computer.....","Smooth Jazz,Jazz,Pop,Easy Listening",lee ritenour one smoothest cleanest playing guitarists thats ever picked instrument first heard vynyl back rock fan totally surprised enjoyed lees clean crisp sound speed edge touched nerve since time ive acquired many recordings seen live several times quot line quot studio concert seriously read liner notes lee fills recording big contemporary jazz names including dave grusin keyboards anthony jackson nathan east sharing bass duties ernie watts sax group plays entire set live direct disc quot rit variations quot opens mid tempo electric classical musing nice basswork jackson punchy lines rit give certain sections al dimeola flamenco feel next lee drops mellow tune lap full nice watts sax work title cut upbeat number lot funky keyboard masons driving drums l lee ritenour ritenour playing guitarists picked instrument heard fan totally surprised enjoyed lees clean crisp sound sound speed speed edge touched nerve time acquired recordings seen live times line quot studio concert seriously read liner liner notes notes fills recording contemporary jazz names including dave grusin keyboards anthony jackson jackson east sharing bass duties ernie watts watts sax group plays entire set live direct disc quot rit variations quot opens mid tempo electric classical musing nice basswork jackson punchy lines rit sections al al dimeola flamenco feel drops mellow tune lap full nice watts sax work title cut upbeat number lot funky keyboard driving drums
73,140,B0000001SB,"For those of you interested in the smooth jazz-sound of Mr Carlton this record is a must. Combining a spicy fusionsound with the sensitivity that only &quot;Mr 335&quot; can produce &quot;Kid Gloves&quot; is really good  value for money. Apart from Last night which is more on the jazz side, this album is probably the best from Larry. It's a GRP album, which usually are not so great (in my opinion) but this effort has a particular sweetness that I expecially love. If you're gonna have a drive maybe with your top down, this is a perfect theme. A really sweet and warm one. Wonderful guitar sounds! I heard this album a few times on youtube.com, and decided to purchase it --- albeit used, but for my collection. The reason for doing so is actually a couple tracks, such as Where be Mosada, a sad and dreamy rendition leaning towares hopeful chords - filled with (amazingly perfect!) tremolo use.  I like the up beat Oui Oui Si Si track too. It's a great Larry Carlton CD.  Anyone who knows of Larry Carlton would be very  satisfied with this CD. Buy it and see for yourself. Larry, as always, displays fine technical skill, fluency, and articulation, as well as the occasional tasty choice of notes however, there is just too much of that, &quot;wonder how long I'll be on hold on the phone?&quot; or &quot;when's my floor coming in the elevator&quot; sound about it. Certainly disappointing when you consider some of this artists fine achievements with the likes of Steely Dan etc. Any appreciator of smooth jazz might inevitably have Larry Carlton and/or Fourplay in her collection. I found this to be one of Larry's best, with it's title tune simply mesmerizing. To make it even sweeter one seller made the sacrificial sale  unbeatable.","Adult Contemporary,Jazz Fusion,Smooth Jazz,Jazz,Pop,R&B",interested smooth jazz sound mr carlton record must combining spicy fusionsound sensitivity quot mr quot produce quot kid gloves quot really good value money apart last night jazz side probably best larry grp usually great opinion effort particular sweetness expecially love youre gonna drive maybe top perfect theme really sweet warm one wonderful guitar sounds heard times youtube com decided purchase albeit used collection reason actually couple mosada sad dreamy rendition leaning towares hopeful chords filled amazingly perfect tremolo use like beat oui oui si si great larry carlton cd anyone knows larry carlton would satisfied thi interested smooth smooth jazz jazz sound mr record combining spicy sensitivity quot mr quot produce quot kid kid gloves gloves really good value money apart night jazz side probably best larry grp usually great opinion effort sweetness love youre drive maybe perfect theme really sweet warm wonderful guitar sounds heard times youtube com decided purchase used collection reason actually sad dreamy rendition leaning hopeful chords filled amazingly perfect tremolo beat oui oui oui oui great larry carlton cd knows larry larry carlton satisfied
74,148,B0000001TL,"I've listened to this record a thousand times and it just keeps impressing/inspiring me. There are so many complex (in a very musical way) elements in it and I've learned a lot, especially rhytmically, from listening to it. Dave has (despite what some critics have said) an amazing feel/groove, and it shows especially on track 8 with a groove that sends chills down the spine!""Tribute"" has a melody line that goes straight into your soul .. truly beautiful and a bit similar to ""Country"" by Keith Jarret, which also is a fantastic song. A tribute to Jarret maybe?By the way .. the solo on track 5 is a keyboard solo, not a guitar solo even if it could sound like a guitar :) someone mentioned it here earlier ... I have just recently discovered Dave Weckl.  Wow, what a breath of fresh air!  I have been listening to this album on Rhapsody (a CD listening service) for about a month now.  After the kids go to bed, I fire up this CD and work on the computer.  This presents a problem in that I can't get to sleep because I have either Crazy Horse or Afrique going over and over in my head.  They started out as my favorites, but the others after listening a few times, are now right up there, so today I had to go purchase the CD here at Amazon. (I could download, but I still like Album Covers).  I wish he had more guitar work in his recent endevours.  The guitar isn't like it is in Rythym of the Soul, but thats for another review.  Buy this only if you are not in the need to sleep. Discovered this on Pandora. Heard two separate cuts and had to see the rest of the CD. I don't know how I missed this 20 years ago. Never heard of the guy back then. Better late than never! Great sound! Another good-sounding record from the worlds best drummer. More funky and less jazzy are the words for this one. Track no. 5 has one of the best guitarsolos I've ever heard. If you are musician of any kind, listen n'  learn. This is how a good drumplayer should sound... This album almost seems like kind of a confused effort. There doesn't seem to be direction. Yes, top notch musicians but disjointed. I really love Dave's other stuff but not this one. Dave Weckl 's mood proves his immense talents as a musician with countless skills in this album of jazz-fusion. You should acquire this imaginative album; filled of dynamic creative energy. A typical mainstream-jazz/fusion effort. Focused more on compositions than improvisation. The musicianship is on a quite high level and Weckl&#8217;s drumming is as always very intricate and melodious. However the sound of synths and the choice of most melodies makes this album very cheesy sounding. Therefore it is almost unlistenable for me. If you like easy listening fusion it may appeal to you but I strongly recommend you the more mature Transition instead of this one. Hard Wired is definitely an improvement over Dave's previous solo album &quot;Heads Up,&quot; especially in the aspect of songwriting. It might still be somewhat of a drummer's album, but after all it IS a drummer's album! Dave plays some great grooves with some crazy beat displacement/syncopation on the more latin-fusion flavored tracks, as well as some straighter pocket playing. Just an interesting side note- the &quot;guitar&quot; solo on track 5 that is mentioned in other reviews is actually Jay Oliver using a unique sound on the keyboard, and using the pitch bend! This is a must have for drummers, but also a good album for anyone who appreciates jazz oriented, instrumental music. I don't think I have much to say here. This CD was one of the first 80s fusion albums that I heard when I was young. Dave Weckl and co. are just top notch musicians, and it shows on every song here. One song in particular, ""Crazy Horse"", has this jaw-dropping guitar solo, I discovered later that it is actually a keyboard solo, totally wicked.In not so many words, if you're a fan of Chick Corea's Elektric Band stuff, you'll love this one. This is not only my favorite Weckl CD, but one of my favorite CDs of all time. When I heard Weckl with Chick's Electric Band I was blown away at his sound. When I heard his compositions on &quot;Master Plan&quot; with Jay Oliver, I was Floored. I had no idea this guy was as great a composer as he was a drummer! Not only are these guys masters of their instruments, they are also amazing composers. The rhythms, the melodies, the solos, are all beyond incredible. Jay Oliver is simply the best soloist I have ever heard. His 'mimic guitar' solo in &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; is the coolest 'guitar solos' I have ever heard. Whether you play drums, bass, guitar, keys, sax, horns or just love hearing the finest compositions played by the finest musicians, GET THIS CD! You will be BLOWN AWAY! This is a drummer's dream! The first 5 tracks are a trip!! Ultra-cool!! Very complex!!! Great fun to listen to!!! This is one CD that you will become addicted to!!!  Top-gun percussionism, outrageously searing saxaphones, rail gliding guitar work and unforgettable keyboards,... these guys ARE in a class all by themselves!!! ,... end of story!! JUST GET IT!! I have never heard Dave and his band until this past week on Pandora. Excellent musicianship!! I really enjoyed all the tracks. When you read other reviews (and mine!) just remember the profound musing ... opinions are like [anatomical descriptor here]: everyone's got one. Now for my second disclaimer: I am a drummer. That said, I enjoy this CD as much for the stellar non-percussion composition and performances as much as I do for the stellar percussion composition and performances.This CD sizzles. It has some songs on it that could be said to have been written with ""pop""y hooks in them, yes. It also has a masterful latin piece (""Dis' Place This"") with some wild rhythms in it (love that piano part!), whimsical tunes (""Afrique"" and ""Just an Illusion""), moody songs (""In Flight"" and ""Where's Tom?""), jazzy urban grooves (""Crazy Horse"" (amazing keyboard work) and ""In the Pocket""), and a soulful, somber finish (""Tribute"") with a wonderfully rich piano part (it takes getting through about a minute of muted key tones played to a ride cymbal to get to it) that the sax picks up and follows along with. The entire horn section is well-written and well-played throughout the album.Weckl definitely gets his time in the spotlight, and NO ONE can do it quite like him. Some of the songs did take a few listens to get into, I admit, but this is now one of my favorite CDs of all time. If you think the samples on Amazon are interesting AT ALL, then BUY IT. I don't think you'll feel you wasted any money after only a few plays.","Jazz Fusion,Smooth Jazz,Jazz,Pop,Modern Postbebop,Bebop",ive listened record thousand times keeps impressing inspiring many complex musical way elements ive learned lot especially rhytmically listening dave despite critics said amazing feel groove shows especially groove sends chills spine tribute melody line goes straight soul truly beautiful bit similar country keith jarret also fantastic tribute jarret maybe way solo keyboard solo guitar solo even could sound like guitar someone mentioned earlier recently discovered dave weckl wow breath fresh air listening rhapsody cd listening service month kids go bed fire cd work computer presents problem cant get sleep either crazy horse listened record times keeps impressing inspiring complex musical way elements learned lot especially listening critics said amazing feel groove shows especially groove sends chills spine tribute melody line goes straight straight soul truly beautiful bit similar country keith keith jarret jarret fantastic tribute jarret maybe way solo keyboard solo solo guitar guitar guitar solo solo sound guitar mentioned earlier recently discovered dave weckl wow breath fresh air listening rhapsody cd listening service month kids bed fire cd work computer presents problem sleep crazy horse
75,156,B0000001V9,"Great soundtrack, missing only the vocal song from the movie but everything else is there.  I dare say the vocal song is available elsewhere if you really want it.Too many film soundtracks tend to sound like compliation albums when they're released and thus lose the whole point of being a soundtrack.  This soundtrack for the 1995 film 'The Cure', an underrated Joseph Mazzello/Brad Renfro movie, is an example of a good soundtrack.  It contains the background music as used in the film and not a lot else.Because of the exceptionally good nature of ths background music (very &quot;american&quot; style if I may say so me being British :)) used in the movie and the way it was used, you can tie every single track on this CD to the appropriate point in the film where it appeared.  It takes you back into the film, in a kind of &quot;down memory lane&quot; way.A overall good CD, but I feel that unless you've seen the movie beforehand, it won't be very interesting.  It's not really good enough in my own opinion as a stand-alone CD; the tones and various paces for the pieces really need the &quot;backing&quot; of the events in the movie to fully understand why various pieces change so dramatically so suddenly.  Like they say, a picture paints a thousand words.I like the movie, I also like the soundtrack.  The two items go together like chalk and cheese.

77,167,B0000001XR,"I can't believe that I am the only one who gave this five stars. Whatever!Talk about a good album. With most of the songs flying by so fast that they annoy the s**t out of people, the album is 24 for songs in exactly 30 minutes.Besides hardcore punk music, the lyrics may hit with a larger range of fans. A lot more of a developed lyrical style, even mixing in rap freestyles to the mix, the album's words could make your mother even like this album.So, if you love fast played punk with excellent lyrics, buy THE CREW!! Also, there are five great live tracks on this album, too! Get schooled, youngins! This is one of the foundation blocks of American hardcore punk. Too many kids today have no knowledge of punk rock before the late 1990's or mid-2000's and that's a big shame because they're not hearing the bands that influenced the bands that influenced their favorite bands so all they're listening to are watered down, weaker versions of the real thing. This is a great CD... if you are into the whole Straightedge punk scene go for this album. Contrary to Amazon's belief, it is not live. It does have a few live tracks but is mostly studio.  Favorite song is &quot;Trust.&quot; Great punk with a great message. 4 out of 5 'cause some of the songs sound almost alike.  Still well worth the price! 7 Seconds were, along with Bad Religion, one of the originators of the ""fast and melodic"" format that harcore punk bands adopted in the early 90's (NOFX, Lag Wagon, Pennywise are some of the bands that adopted this style). ""The Crew"" must be the epitome of 7 Seconds ""hardcore "" era; the band plays at a furious thrash-like speed, but the vocal delivery always remains melodic without sounding sugary or happy go lucky (sorry, Simple Plan fans!). After this album, 7 Seconds started to ""experiment"" with their sound, drifting farther and farther away from their faster-than-thou sound and into a more ""U2 on steroids"" sound. Anyway, ""The Crew"" is an album that should stand side by side with other hardcore classics like MINOR THREAT, BAD BRAINS, AGNOSTIC FRONT, DRI and BLACK FLAG. The sound varies slightly from song to song (as if the band were trying to improve on the mix each time)but the overall sound is clear yet powerful. Troy's drumming, though simplistic, cuts through the songs like a hot knife and the rest of the instruments sound intense enough. The lyrics were a bit of a departure from what was going on with the hardcore scene in the mid 80's; the band sang about unity, tolerance and respect, instead of fearing nuclear warfare, which was the common thing to sing about.""Here's your warning"", ""Definite choice"", ""Bully"" and the heartfelt but tough-as-nails ""Trust"" are just some of the stand out tracks. This album, without a doubt in my mind, 7 SECONDS' finest moment, although newer releases such as ""Good To Go"" almost match this gem with its raw intensity! &quot;Trust&quot; (track 18) was, as far as I can tell, the first hardcore love song. (In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of any others.)As a &quot;sensitive, tortured&quot; lyricist, Kevin Seconds came to fancy  himself a peer of Ian MacKaye's (Minor Threat, Embrace, Fugazi)--and though  he never succceeded--the songs on this album represent a signficant  evolution from the group's inane Alternative Tentacles debut (which  featured the classic &quot;I Hate Sports&quot;). The record was as described and the price was excellent.It did not take so long to recive either.A recommended seller.Thanx. I picked this album up after having listened to &quot;Good to Go&quot; about a million times.  &quot;The Crew&quot; is great mid-80's hardcore.  If you're into punk/hardcore, buy it today. The good:7 Seconds' brand of melodic hardcore still packs a punch after all these years. The lyrics show an infectious positivity that put them above some of their nihilistic peers. Songs like ""Bully"" and ""Trust"" show a surprisingly developed sense of melody that would inspire later bands like Bad Religion and Gorilla Biscuits. At 18 tracks (plus several bonus live cuts), there's more than enough great hardcore here to justify the cost.The bad:It's 80s hardcore punk, so naturally the songs tend to blend together on repeated listens. The lyrics can occaisonally meander into punk cliches and perhaps a bit too much immaturity for their own good. If you're just getting started in the world of hardcore punk, other releases by bands like Minor Threat and Bad Brains are far more essential than this.Overall:The Crew holds up surprisingly well more than two decades after its' initial recording. While it's not quite a hardcore classic, it's still a fast and fun album that's a perfect introduction to the band. This is a classic album- a must-have for anyone into punk or hardcore.  I really don't find Kevin Seconds attractive, but I would totally make out with him just on premise after listening to this.","Alternative Rock,American Alternative,Straight Edge,Metal,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore,Hardcore & Punk",cant believe one gave five stars whatever talk good flying fast annoy people exactly minutes besides hardcore punk lyrics may hit larger range fans lot developed lyrical style even mixing rap freestyles mix words could make mother even like love fast played punk excellent lyrics buy crew also five great live get schooled youngins one foundation blocks american hardcore punk many kids today knowledge punk rock late mid thats big shame theyre hearing bands influenced bands influenced favorite bands theyre listening watered weaker versions real thing great cd whole straightedge punk scene go believe stars talk good flying fast people exactly minutes hardcore hardcore punk punk lyrics hit larger range fans lot developed lyrical style mixing rap freestyles mix words mother love fast played punk excellent lyrics buy crew great live schooled youngins foundation foundation blocks blocks american american hardcore hardcore hardcore punk punk kids today knowledge punk punk rock rock late mid shame hearing bands influenced bands influenced favorite bands listening watered weaker versions real great cd straightedge punk punk scene scene

80,176,B0000001YL,"If you like the Bouncing Souls, you wont be disappointed. I'm a BMX racer and I love The BMX Song. The rest of the CD is great too. This album is what got me into punk rock 10 years ago. I heard The BMX Song once, and I've been a Bouncing Souls fan ever since. Highly recommended sing along punk rock. The best there is in my opinion. as one of the other reviewers said, these are one of the bands that got me into punk rock in the first place.  from the dumb little jingles on tgtbata to making referencing 80's movies very cool in punk, and from johnny x and their first release on epitaph, i can honestly say i had more fun being into this band than almost any other growing up.  this is the record that set it off - you should buy it.  also one of the best live bands i've ever seen... multiple times. One of my favorite albums from my youth, finally back on vinyl! So glad this is available now! A must-have! Any one who likes punk or is interested get this cd!!! Its constanly in my  cd player. Get it now. The BMX songs pretty funny!I got some dark shades  and ran over some rollar bladers!! Well later yall email me if you got any  cds to recomend! Hopeless Romantic used to be my favorite souls album, but after finally getting around to buying this one i think we have a new champion.  i'd seen the band live a couple of times and got this album for &quot;here we go,&quot; but besides that, it's got BMX Song and Lamar Vanoy, and 'Quik Check Girl', which is the greatest pop-punk unrequited love song ever written.  if you like Green Day or other poppy, sing-along type punk bands then you need to get this album.  besides, they are from New Brunswick so they rule. This is the best album released by the best punk band out right now.  Their music is original and talent-filled.  Also thrown in is the BS's lyrical ability which is essential for an album to be truly great.  Songs  like &quot;quick check girl&quot; and &quot;born to lose&quot; will make  you bouncing souls fan if you aren't already.  They are also great live,  see them if they ever come to your town, or at least buy the live  album This is my favorite Bouncing Souls album, although Hopeless Romantic is  another standout in my lil head. My favorite song has got to be The Freaks,  Nerds , and Romantics or Argyle cause i can relate. But dude the whole cd  is great..i recommend! too bad it doesnt have more than 12 tracks...but  still- GOOD ALBUM wooo!","Alternative Rock,Punk Revival,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore & Punk",like bouncing souls wont disappointed im bmx racer love bmx rest cd great got punk rock years ago heard bmx ive bouncing souls fan ever since highly recommended sing along punk rock best opinion one reviewers said one bands got punk rock first place dumb little jingles tgtbata making referencing movies cool punk johnny x first release epitaph honestly say fun band almost growing record set buy also one best live bands ive ever seen multiple times one favorite youth finally back vinyl glad available must one likes punk interested get cd constanly cd player get bmx pretty funny g like bouncing souls wont disappointed im bmx bmx racer racer love bmx rest cd great got punk punk rock rock years years ago heard bmx bouncing souls fan ever since highly recommended sing sing along punk punk rock rock best opinion reviewers said bands got punk punk rock rock place dumb jingles referencing movies cool punk johnny first release release epitaph honestly say fun fun band band growing record record set set buy best live live bands bands seen multiple times favorite youth finally vinyl glad available likes punk interested cd cd cd player player bmx pretty funny
81,177,B0000001Z1,"Once again, Hepcat follows trough with an album that follows the traditional sound of 60's ska with the right amount of jazz and soul.  The smooth vocals of Lee and Barry blend well with a tight rhythm section and joyous horns.  Tracks like the infectious &quot;Bobby and Joe&quot; provide  a good counterpoint to slower and more contemplative tunes like  &quot;Solo&quot;. For those fans of jazz-like ska, try &quot;Yokozuna&quot;  for a good listen.  A great album, and one of the best ska albums in recent  years. This is another great album,just like &quot;out of nowhere&quot; and &quot;right on time&quot;. I have been a loyal fan of this group and take every opportunity I have to see them live.Not only is their music boss but  they put on an awesome show.For all the fans out in Los Angeles who don't  already know,they're playin at House of Blues on Jan.21'00 so don't miss  it! This CD is by far one of the greatest finds I have made--thanks to down loading music.If you take your ska back to its roots, this is the album for you.  In the vein of their modern peers, the Toasters, this Hepcat's album takes the ska sound back to the original 1950's and 60's rude boys of Jamaica.  The Hepcats are true to their predecessors--the Skatalites, King Tubby, Desmond Decker, and others.  This is not your neighbors ska-core, this is real island ska.Buy it, you wont regret it. I listen to this while working.  great beats and underappreciated again and again.  A great band with great sound! Highly recommend Even people who don't particularly like ska will enjoy this album.

82,179,B0000001ZN,"How boring can one album be?  This is a mishmash of every slow song ever heard...just more boring. Greg Kihn puts together an excellent batch of songs ranging from a Kink's cover to catchy originals like &quot;Vampira&quot;. The highlight has to be the title track and &quot;Trials, troubles, and tribulations&quot;. I had not listened to Greg Kihn for years, but when I first heard this album I was blown away.  This is a combination of acoustic songs in varying styles from blues to rock to ballads.  Especially great are the title cut,  Horrorshow;the Kinks song, Waterloo Sunset; and Trials, Troubles,  Tribulations.  This is a mature artist at his best, doing exactly the kind  of material he wants without having to bend to any commercial pressures.  One of my favorite albums of the 90s. This album was made in 1996, way after Greg Kihn's heyday, such as it was. I can't name even three Greg Kihn songs that aren't on this record. So why has this CD never been out my of reach since somebody pushed it on me many years ago? Because I can't get enough of his weary voice and the lush but understated orchestral backing on Noa Noa and Horror Show. The title track is as poignant as John Fogerty's Long as I Can See the Light or the Kinks' Hollywood Boulevard. Speaking of which, Kihn's Waterloo Sunset may be the most underrated cover of the most underrated band of all time.","Alternative Rock,New Wave & Post-Punk,Pop,New Wave,Power Pop,Singer-Songwriters,Rock,Folk",boring one mishmash every slow ever heard boring greg kihn puts together excellent batch ranging kinks cover catchy originals like quot vampira quot highlight title quot trials troubles tribulations quot listened greg kihn years first heard blown away combination acoustic varying styles blues rock ballads especially great title cut horrorshow kinks waterloo sunset trials troubles tribulations mature artist best exactly kind material wants without bend commercial pressures one favorite made way greg kihns heyday cant name even three greg kihn arent record cd never reach since somebody pushed many years ago cant ge boring mishmash slow heard boring greg greg kihn excellent batch ranging kinks cover catchy originals quot quot highlight title quot trials troubles tribulations listened greg greg kihn years heard blown blown away away combination acoustic varying styles blues blues rock rock rock ballads ballads especially great title cut horrorshow kinks waterloo sunset sunset trials troubles tribulations mature artist best exactly kind material wants bend commercial pressures favorite way greg greg kihns heyday greg greg kihn arent record cd reach somebody pushed years years ago ge

84,181,B00000020C,"The nineties appeared to be the resurrection years of Bert Jansch. 'The Ornament Tree'(1990), a tasteful rendition of Scottish folksongs, was the start and 'When The Circus Comes To Town' (1995) is his masterpiece of this era. Strong lyrics, beautiful melodies, his wonderful guitarplaying. Bert is back in town again!Songs like 'Stealing the night away', 'Morning brings peace of mind', 'Just a dream' make it completely obvious: Bert Jansch was and still is one of the greatest singer/songwriters we ever had on this planet!A remarkable aspect: The bluesy 'No-one around', written by Janie Romer and the only song not penned by Jansch on this album, is the highlight of 'Circus...'.'Circus...' has got a quality similar to albums such as 'Rosemary Lane'(1971), 'L.A. Turnaround (1974) and 'A Rare Conundrum' (1977). I've been following Jansch since I discovered Pentangle the year they broke up in the early '70s, but I never knew about this release until last year (2011).  It was a limited release originally and apparently not well promoted.  However, this ranks with the best of his works.  You can tell Bert poured his whole heart into the compositions. The songs are highly inventive, yet relaxed and natural.  They are some of the richest of his career.  While it has a cool slow-strolling jazz sound, you actually feel the humidity in the Summer Heat.  Walk Quietly By is a sweet observation of an old man's life, with Bert's classic hint of nostalgia that never becomes cloying.  No One Around has a classy blues swing.  Born With The Blues goes back to Bert's spare, pure vocal/guitar blues days and would fit very well (along with Open Road) on one of his early albums. Morning Brings Peace of Mind could easily be an early work, having a melodic resemblance to Sally Free and Easy.  The title song and Stealing the Night Away stand out with a drive unlike his other songs.  The weak point is the throwaway, Honey, Don't You Understand.  It is too  cloying with its simplistic melody - fine if it were a children's song, but not here. It is much too out-of-step on a disc that includes such passionate soul-searchers like Living In The Shadows and Step Back. After scanning albums for a while here on Amazon, it looks like Yes, Led Zep, Pink Floyd and their ilk have several million reviews and comments. Seems pretty quiet over in the Jansch area. But I go there on occasion and like what I find. I have some of his early lps and a few on disc and a Pentangle here and there. While my history with this stuff appears to be long, it might not be ""purist"" deep. I don't get hung up on any one record or genre and I listen to lots of things. Even Charles Ives or Paganini. On several forays into died-in-the-wool-folk clubs I ordered the wrong drink and felt I had to leave. So dilettante that I may be--I like this record. This is kind of a gem. The warmth and personality come through first. Jansch is obviously a fine acoustic guitarist and the stuff going on underneath the vocal is quite intriguing. Like Kottke, the vocal sort of belongs to the guy playing so it's part of the deal. Emotive, perhaps is descriptive enough. The songs might be contemporary versions of music from way back in the tradition--worthwhile from several angles. Walk Quietly By comes in quietly. Open Road, likewise. Meditative way to begin the disc. Simple accompaniment shows up throughout the proceedings. Drums and bass on the title tune, sax intro on Summer Heat. Perfect setting by the way. Very pretty guitar on The Lady Doctor From Ashington. Back up with Stealing the Night Away--one of my favorites here. Electric slide playing has just the right strength. Further along, Born With the Blues carries his career-long trademark sound. Morning Brings Peace of Mind with light touch guitar and backing strings then leads to the program's final song--Living In the Shadows. ""For the whole damned world to see."" Guitar, bass, drums and sax. And words of wisdom. Thirty years after his debut, Bert Jansch shows that this Scottish folk singer/guitarist/songwriter only gets better with age.  On this collection of mostly originals (&quot;No-One Around&quot; is the lone exception), Jansch utilizes other musicians with a fiddle here (&quot;Step Back&quot;) or a saxophone there (&quot;Summer Heat&quot;), but each song showcases Jansch's own warm vocals and understated guitar work, especially lovely is the instrumental &quot;The Lady Doctor from Ashington.&quot;  Not only is this Jansch's best album of the Nineties, it's quite simply one of the best albums of his career.

85,183,B000000231,"I was lucky enough to be a freshman in high school when the Mink were starting to blow up at Macalester College and all over the Minneapolis/St.Paul rock scene.  I have their early demos and seven inches, I saw them in grungy coffee shops and basements and bars all over the twin cities.  I lived for them, and they still thrill me to this day. Buy all their records, and send them money and roses and thank you cards. Like the reviewer below, I rate El Producto as the best WM outing.  I also like their self-titled record a bit better than Colossus, but really, that's not an indictment of this record as much as a recognition of the standard they've set.  Mellower yet catchy as ever, WM on Colossus sounds relaxed and confident.  Given the circumstances under which the record was recorded, maybe they felt some freedom they hadn't in the past.Whatever the case, generally they seem to have chosen to turn down the volume in favor of cleaner guitar tones and slightly more intricate arrangements (if that's possible).  The opener, &quot;Goodnite&quot;, reveals the cleaner tone with its catchy riff, and the song &quot;Lama&quot; might have the coolest guitar riff John Kimbrough has ever done.  In between there's straight-ahead pop on &quot;She Can Smile&quot;, a rocking ode to mothers on &quot;Brave Beyond The Call&quot; and a nice solo acoustic number tacked onto the final selection.It's a different kind of record than they've done before, but the quality is as high as ever. This CD finds Walt Mink sounding older and mellower. It is no mistake that this came out on a label best known for emo -- at times this album is downright depressing. But then, if I had just been through what they went through with their previous album (and sole major label release) El Producto, I would proabably be depressed too. That is not to say that they no longer rock. It is just that here they have matured to the point that they realize they don't always have to rock. And here, more than anywhere else, their queiter stuff works. I still would pick El Producto as the Walt Minks best release, but this is an album you should own. This is the Mink in their glory.... THE BEST And tragically....the last studio album from them. The Mink broke up shortly into their supporting tour of this CD.  Thank god I got to see them on this tour.

86,184,B000000233,"When I find a CD this good that has been around since 1998, I don't know whether to be glad that I found it or feel stupid for not knowing about it till now.  I've played it every day since coming across it, so maybe I've made up for lost time.  These guys really have the Deep Elm emo sound down, but with a much more powerful fullness than most Deep Elm discs.  Brilliant vocals/lyrics blended into forceful guitar band music.  A fascinating synthesis of sound and sincerity.  There are no accidents here, every note, sound, and word has a purpose.  Every song is a crafted work of experiential art.  This is like the doctoral dissertation level of emo music.  &quot;Operator&quot; is one of the greatest hardcore emo songs ever recorded, a tour de force of power and heart.  This song alone would make this a five star CD, but every song is within a hair of being just as good.  Only Deep Elm has the guts to put out music this intelligent.  Outstanding. It comes as no surprise that every review gives this album 5 stars. And it's not one of those obscure mediocre bands that carry a 5 star rating because they have one review..or one fan. TFA put out two albums that are astouding in their consistency, beauty, and capacity to rock. I don't like to generalize but for me this WAS the melodic rock band of the 90's even though I've just found that out in the last six months of 2001. Buy or die! From the first time i saw these guys i was like,&quot;Hey, these guys are pretty cool.&quot; Now the only thing i listen to in the car is Triple Fast Action or Metallica. They have really good songs that might take a little  getting used to but it nothing out of the ordinary if you like hard rock.  Of course their guitar and lyrical work is top of the line but the drumming  is what really sticks in my head.....it's awesome. It is actually the  current drummer of Local at this time. This is why i don't know why these  guys never earned the credit they deserved. They had a couple hits on the  radio but a lot of people still never heard of them. Well, I'm telling you  first hand this is a really good album and you should give it a try. If you  can find their first album Broadcaster, which is out of print, that is just  as good as their last one. Coming from a band that hardly anyone has ever heard of, it's hard to believe that their only two CDs are so great.  But along with Cattlemen Don't, their debut CD (Broadcaster) is equally as good.  What makes this album different is the fact that the songs here are a collection of unreleased and new songs, whereas Broadcaster was just their debut release.  Even though Triplefastaction is no longer a true band, don't let that phase you.  All the songs on this CD are good, and not a one should go overlooked.  Here's a short overview of the 14 songs on the CD.""Ronnie's Theme"" and ""Pure"", in essence, work as one song (""Ronnie's Theme"" is only five seconds long).  It's a great song that really starts off the CD with a bang.  It's a hard rock song and has some great, emotional lyrics.  The next song, ""Heroes"", is a bit different.  It lacks the heaviness of ""Pure"", but it works well.  The song is very good and lyrically it's awesome.  I do like the song ""If"", but not as much as some of the others.  It's a decent song; one of those you'll have to decide for yourself.  The title track of the CD, on the other hand, is one of the better songs so far.  It's slow, soft, yet maintains TFA's usual rock & roll style.I have to say, honestly, ""Eurogirl"" is the worst song on Cattlemen Don't.  It's not terrible, but it's not good either.  But the next song will make you forget about it anyways.  ""The Rescue"" is a great song that uses its lyrics to ride the music.  It's really a neat song that takes you right into ""I'm Ready"".  ""I'm Ready"" is a fast paced song that is slightly different from the rest of the album.  It's good, but still not the best.  At this point, the next song becomes my favorite so far.  ""Duck And Run"" has probably the best lyrics of any song on the CD, and is as fast paced as the last one.  Yet it's more melodic and cool.Given the fact that we've already had seven out of eight songs be great, we reach an almost ineffectual (though still decent) point of the CD.  The two songs ""Sent Them Straight"" and ""Yeah"" lack good lyrics, although they do slow down the pace of the CD; for those who can't handle it.  And as for the song ""Operator""...well, classic.  It's a fabulous song with some really good lyrics, but an even better beat.  Besides ""Pure"" and what's to come, it's my favorite.  Then you have ""No Doubt""; an average but good TFA song.  And finally, we reach my favorite Triplefastaction song of all-time: ""Bearer Of Bad News"".  This epic masterpiece takes the cake as the best song on the CD; and from their debut CD.  The lyrics are so amazing and the five minutes of music just flow through you with incredible ease.  It's relaxing, and will really leave you with a feeling of utter happiness.In conclusion, this CD is probably the most underrated and overlooked release that music has been a part of.  It is no doubt a 5 star CD.  And like Broadcaster, every song is at least decent if not great; the epic song is unbelievable; the weaker points only lead to the best; and it's certainly worth your time.  Once you get this album, and if you like it, make sure you pick up Broadcaster and look into my favorite band: Local H.  Triplefastaction's former drummer Brian St. Clair now plays in the remarkable two man band and is featured on their 2002 CD Here Comes The Zoo.

88,186,B000000238,"There is Bill Monroe, and their is Ralph Stanley. There is the Louvin Brothers and Jesse and Jimmy, but then there is The Seldom Scene. This is the album to buy if you want to learn where Bluegrass Music gets it's progressive sound that you hear now in the 21st Century. This album has it all. Buy, Listen to It and learn why so many people love The Seldom Scene. -charlie tew, North Carolina Bluegrass Association If you are buying just one Seldom Scene...this be it. Showcases the members talent quite well. Great for &#34;walk in&#34; or outro. THE BEST HARMONIES THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD ON A BLUEGRASS CD. THIS IS A KEEPER. I recommmend this selection for those who enjoy Blugrass music at its best,even though some of these selections were performed in the early years of the group the music has its own distinct sound. This music had an excellent sound quality,& the band was also a joy to listen to. I hope they play soon at a location near me. We heard one of Seldom Scene's songs on a radio Bluegrass station.  Loved it, so ordered a CD.  The songs are great, and we love the voices and instrumentals.  Wish we had discovered the group long ago. From the title you can see where I am headed.First...these are the best bluegrass albums I have ever owned. I dont know how I missed them over the years while I listened to Flatt and Scruggs, Dillards, et al.Once I did discover them a year ago I raced off to Amazon and bought four CD's about one month apart.Having done that, and having listened to them now for six months my advice, not necessarily my reviews, would be........Buy the original Rebel CD's starting with the earliest ones. My favorite is Different Roads..its got a good mix of mellow and raucous and every song is a ten.I interspersed the straight CD's ( mixed and recorded in a studio ) with concert CD's and I think its a big mistake.With the straight CD's none of the songs are duplicates and all are the best versions of their best songs. When you start buying the concert CD's you get duplication of songs, and they are not usually the best version. You also get the chipping on stage and even worse, the screamers who find it necessary to yell like they just got 600 volts on private parts...horrible.So for me...the SS clean recording studio CD's are all fives compared to other Blue grass groups...harmony, instruments, and material ( Starling's songs are incredible if you like soft, crafted stories put to music ).Knowing what I know now, the  only concert album I would buy is Cellar Door because songs 5,10, 15, 17 and 21 are fantastic..the rest are not my cup of tea. I would also shoot the screamer if I could.So..good luck with SS. They are fantastic Bluegrass artists and should be part of any bluegrass aficionado's collection. What's not to love about the Seldom Scene. They are great vocalists and instrumentalists. Several tunes feature the late John Duffy - what a great talent lost. I recommend this album to anyone who loves bluegrass, you will be singing along with them in no time!","Contemporary Folk,Country,Bluegrass,Pop,Today's Country,Folk",bill monroe ralph stanley louvin brothers jesse jimmy seldom scene buy want learn bluegrass gets progressive sound hear st century buy listen learn many people love seldom scene charlie tew north carolina bluegrass association buying one seldom scene showcases members talent quite well great walk outro best harmonies ever heard bluegrass cd keeper recommmend selection enjoy blugrass best even though selections performed early years group distinct sound excellent sound quality band also joy listen hope play soon location near heard one seldom scenes radio bluegrass station loved ordered bill bill monroe monroe ralph ralph stanley stanley louvin brothers brothers jimmy seldom seldom scene scene buy want learn bluegrass progressive sound hear century buy listen learn people love seldom seldom scene scene tew north bluegrass association buying seldom seldom scene scene showcases members talent quite great walk outro best harmonies heard bluegrass cd keeper selection enjoy best selections performed early early years years group distinct sound excellent sound sound quality quality band joy listen hope play soon location heard seldom seldom scenes scenes radio bluegrass station loved ordered

I have a lot of Country Gentlemen LPs and CDs since they are one of my most favorite bluegrass performers. This one, however, is unique because of the live environment.  I have many of the same songs from other LPs and CDs, but actually prefer these live versions.  This particular set of Country Gentlemen performers, among the many who have been with the group's main man, Charlie Waller, seems the best to me, and in front of an appreciative audience, they are clearly doing their best work.  You cannot go wrong with this CD. Worth every penny. The Country Gentlemen is arguably one of the two best bluegrass bands ever (the other being The Seldom Scene, both of which were formed by the late great John Duffey), this live album is very enjoyable, if for no other reason than it IS live which brings out the best in the personalities of these great men, particularly the Hank Snow impressions of the great Charlie Waller.If you love bluegrass and haven't heard this album, you must buy it.

As casual as a glass of tea on the porch, precise as a carpenter's rule, Shuffler's 6-string work cascades up and down, round and round, like a mountain road. There's no fiddle, so this makes for a unique Stanley Brothers band. They had just come off a week-long stint at Johnny's Used Cars near Baltimore, and the owner, Johnny Willbanks, was also the 'CEO' of Wango Records, and got this version of the band to record four albums for him. This is the second in the series (Wango 104), and was the only album to feature purely secular material. Carter sounds very strong on this, invested you might say; and Ralph's unmistakable tenor adds the mountain soul that the Stanley Brothers have always been famous for, and his banjo picking is superb.

92,192,B0000002A4,"This, my friends, is the real deal - straight-ahead bluegrass from a consummate master of the genre and his very able band, recorded in Tokyo in the early 1970's.  The quality of the recording is outstanding - note the Neumann mics depicted on the album cover.  This CD has a nice balance of ""Gospel/sacred"" hits like ""Memories of Mother"" and ""Rank Stranger.""  They also break out with ""I Saw the Light"" - giving a great bluegrass arrangement to Hank Williams' classic.  There are a few novelty tunes, like ""Listen to the Mockingbird"" and ""How Far to Little Rock?""  There are some instrumentals, where Ralph really pulls out the stops on the banjo.  In general, this is Ralph Stanley at the peak of his musical prowess, performing before an enthusiastic audience.  If you love the Stanley sound, bluegrass music, or just music, then you need to own this album. The Stanley Brothers have continued to turn out great traditional American  bluegrass albums for over 50 years, and &quot;Live In Japan&quot; is one of  their best. Live In Japan is good old fashioned Smokey Mountain Bluegrass,  a mixture of standard and gospel favorites. The older Ralph Stanley gets,  the better he gets.

93,199,B0000002HZ,"This album demonstrates how absolutely phenomenal a singer and fiddler Alison Krauss since her early teens! Sheer delight to trace her gracious development as artist, leader, and influence over the decades. This record is one of my two top bluegrass records, (the other one is Emmylou Harris &amp; the Nash Ramblers) I didn't know that she was 15 at the time and that does add to the experience for me of listening to a truly  remarkable voice. Hardcore Bluegrass fans may not like it as much as a  casual listener, but this record is as good as it gets. Ms. Krauss has  almost knocked Bonnie Raitt off the top of my list of female vocalists.  The fact that she could get Sam Bush &amp; Jerry Douglass to play w/ her  speaks not only to her vocal ability, but her great fiddle palying as well.  Buy this record! I think this is by far the best CD I have ever purchased.  The singing is superb, the music above excellent.  If you are new to bluegrass and Alison Krauss this is a good introduction to both! I have all Alison Krauss's (& The Union Station's) Albums, one of the best bluegrass bands around today.  If you haven't heard them I highly recommend you try them. Hard to believe that over twenty years have passed since this gem emerged.  She was an amazing talent then, and is even more of one now! Just when I thought I knew what all of my favorite songs by Alison were, I bought Too Late to Cry, one of her earlier works.  Foolish Heart, In Your Eyes and Don't Follow Me are now on my long list of AK and AKUS favorites.  This enormously talented singer musician has done it again.  Just buy all her music; you can't miss. She's my favoriete, I love this CD. I remember distinctly when I first heard one of the cuts on the lp version of Too Late to Cry on a radio show called Grass Roots or something like that out of Kalamazoo, MI.  I stopped whatever I was doing to listen closely to &quot;Don't Follow Me&quot;, and then the first chance I got to get up to Lansing's Elderly Instruments (the best darn music &amp; instrument store in Michigan)I bought it.I think this recording is just about as perfect as anything since Abbey Road.  Each song is a little gem.  I really prefer Alison's voice as it sounds in these earlier recordings:  stronger, more nasal.  She purposely changed it to the softer, more pop-friendly version around the time of the &quot;Every Time You Say Goodbye&quot;, I believe.  But her singing is not the only treat; she had won many awards for her fiddle playing by this time, and it shines; and she is backed up by only the best musicians in bluegrass---Jerry Douglas &amp; Sam Bush, for example.Peppy, strong, and true to bluegrass roots. What a breath of fresh air in the Country music field.  Such an excellent CD.  Shania and Faith should listen to this, see what a real singer is like (at 15 no less) and then quit the business. In 1987 Alison was only 15, and some of the songs on this CD are kind of &quot;honky-tonky&quot;.  In &quot;Song For Life&quot; the lyric begins &quot;I don't drink as much as I used to....&quot; and it's a little incongruous putting the words together with the 15 year-old voice.  Her vocal tone was a little twangy and nasal-sounding, almost strident as she belted out some of these tunes, and I wonder if she was influenced maybe a little by some of the Nashville Big-Hair bunch like Reba.Still.... if she had not appeared until today and suddenly this recording appeared, it would be at least as head-turning today as it was 15 years ago.  No other vocalist in the genre approaches this kind of material with this kind of instrumentation with THAT kind of voice.  Alison surrounded herself by superstars like Sam Bush and Jerry Douglas, so the supporting cast was top-notch.In her first recording she was both astonishingly new and talented, but also showed great promise of things to come.  In the recordings that followed she has unfailingly measured up to that promise. Even in her first record she began showing her taste for sorrowful mournful tunes of doomed love, even on uptempto tunes like &quot;Don't Follow Me&quot; and the title &quot;Too Late to Cry&quot;.  She also began demonstrating her talent for beautiful slow ballads like &quot;Gentle River&quot;.Required stuff for those who want the complete Alison Krauss collection, but I knock it down to 4 stars because the maturity of her voice and mastery of material would show up in full on later recordings. Allison Krauss has an amazing voice.  Her band is good too.  Easy listening and easy to hum or sing along. This CD showcases Alison Krauss's amazing voice in songs that show it to its best advantage.  The producers of her more recent CDs have chosen songs and arrangements that lack energy and cause her singing to be breathy.  In  1987, these folks hadn't gotten their hands on her, and she's in full voice  on the slower songs as well as the faster ones.Jerry Douglas, Sam Bush,  and Tony Trischka are the &quot;name&quot; musicians accompanying her; the  lesser-known musicians play just as well, though, and Alison's fiddling is  impeccable.This CD has it all - good songs (good in their own right and  good choices for Alison to sing), good picking, and good singing. Alison was just fifteen when she made her recording debut with this album but, even at that age, she was ready for it. She is both only a talented musician and a wonderful singer with a great voice, which has echoes of Dolly, Reba and Emmylou while not being too much like any of them. Her music has changed significantly through the years so fans of her more recent albums may not like her early work. My eclectic taste in music allows me to enjoy all her music though I generally prefer the early stuff.The songs are mostly obscure, the most widely known being Song for life, which is a classic from the pen of Rodney Crowell. Alison plays the fiddle on all tracks where one is used, but there are two instrumentals, both covers (Tony Trischka's Forgotten pictures and the traditional Dusty Miller) that demonstrate Alison's skills as a fiddler very clearly. The remaining songs are only originals, mostly from the pen of John Pennell.This may not be the best album that Alison ever recorded - though some think it is and I can understand why - but it is certainly among the best. It's not difficult to figure out why Alison has been so successful. If you are unfamiliar with Alison's early music, you should first try Now that I've found you - A collection. If you enjoy that, particularly the track Sleep on (taken from this album), give this a listen. I have every album she has made and I enjoy the progression through the years. This is a great blend of styles and music..tap your toes and enjoy just love Alison Krauss. good old blue grass.Bruoght back old memories of times goneby. what can i say it a good thing. Ok folks, anyone who is a fan of bluegrass and/of Alison has got ot have this CD it is her first and in my opinion her best one ever. You won't be dissapointed! I had this on a cassette for years and wore it out...lolI love this album! I've bought it in CD and now MP3...I still listen to it, almost every week, if not everyday! Excellent album.

Her voice is lovely, though not unique - it sounds a lot like Emmylou's, but that's no bad thing. Claire can (and does) sing a variety of songs, from ballads to more uptempo songs, all brilliantly.I've got all seven of Claire's CD's, including the two listed as Front Porch String Band. Don't overlook those - they are every bit as good as Claire's solo music, which sometimes features some of the FPSB musicians. I can't pick a favorite among them, but this one would certainly be a contender if I were forced to choose.Claire wrote or co-wrote five of these songs. None of the other songs are well-known but, like Claire's own, they are all very enjoyable. If you like bluegrass, it doesn't come any better than this.

95,214,B0000002O1,"With the watered-down pop-slick music that's labeled &quot;country&quot; these days, what a joy it is to hear The Del McCoury Band. The musicianship is absolutely astoundingly jaw-dropping good in its perfection, with raw emotion and soul pouring out of each song.Del's voice, with that &quot;high &amp; lonesome&quot; sometimes raspy sound, has a terrific range of feeling...listen to &quot;Smoking Gun&quot;, and another favorite, &quot;Blackjack County Chains&quot;, with its weeping fiddle and guitar work, and marvelous melody.Sadly, the booklet insert doesn't include the lyrics. As Robert Oermann says in it: &quot;Del is particularly noted for choosing dark, almost morbid lyrics and dramatic story songs&quot;...and the songs in this CD have a &quot;bite&quot; and a lot of humor nestled between the hard-luck and &quot;cold hard facts&quot; of life stories.This CD is true blue Americana art at its finest, and if you like bluegrass, it's a must to own. I find myself humming the tunes on this CD all the time.This is the CD that introduced me to Del McCoury, recently, even though Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia proclaimed a Del McCoury day, some years ago, for Del's enormous  contribution to bluegrass music.Unfortunately for me, a buddy of mine  has borrowed this CD from me and keeps &quot;forgetting&quot; return it.  He's not forgetting, he loves the CD as I do and is just too cheap to buy  one of his own. I purchased Cold Hard Facts because I am a HUGE Del Mccoury fan.  This is a good CD, but I personally have others that I think are outstanding.  If you like  Mccoury music, you will also like this one. ive been a del mccoury fan for a few years . . . and this is is best work. what a voice! and great lyrics and musicianship. del picks great tunes with a real story, usually grim or ironic, and sings it wich bluegrass purity.  buy it, you'll love it.gary e. Very pleased with the download.  So glad we can get mp3's from Amazon instead of waiting for the CD to come in the mail!  Great service! Hum (see above review), Hell!, I'm DANCIN'!! Can't wait to get home (I'm listening at work)and get my ol'man's Ovation out and pick along - well, I'll coerce HIM to pick along! Warm's up a cold Minnesota winter.  Not recommended for the faint of (hillbilly) heart. YEEHAWWW This is a ""pretty good"" collection of music .. I'm one of Del McCoury's biggest fans and there are albums that will become ""Must Have"" classics before this .. Good but, not my favorite. It would not be an exaggeration to say that all of Del McCoury's albums are good, but this one is truly great! This is real bluegrass. Now in his seventies, Del McCoury is one of the few surviving traditionalists from the Bill Monroe school of bluegrass featuring the trademark high lonesome vocal sound.  In fact, in the mid-Sixties, McCoury served a stint with the father of bluegrass music as guitar player and lead vocalist in Monroe's Bluegrass Boys.While McCoury takes a traditionalist's approach to bluegrass, his song selection certainly steps outside the box as shown by his covers of Robert Cray's &quot;Smoking Gun&quot; and Tom Petty's &quot;Love Is a Long Road.&quot;And you won't find a better collection of musicians in bluegrass music.  Del's band includes sons Rob (banjo) and Ronnie (possibly the best mandolin player around), Jason Carter (fiddle), Mike Bub (bass) and the best Dobro player on the planet, Jerry Douglas.  They all get a chance to shine on Ronnie's instrumental &quot;Baltimore Jonny.&quot;This is hard-driving bluegrass with standout tracks like &quot;Hard on My Heart&quot; and &quot;Snake in the House&quot; and will make a fine addition to your collection.

96,220,B0000002QZ,"This review is being used to describe several of Woody Guthrie's recordings. Although I have listened to most of his songs and recordings these represent those that best represent his life's poltical and musical work.My musical tastes were formed, as were many of those of the generation of 1968, by `Rock and Roll' music exemplified by the Rolling Stones and Beatles and by the blues revival, both Delta and Chicago style. However, those forms as much as they gave pleasure were only marginally political at best. In short, these were entertainers performing material that spoke to us. In the most general sense that is all one should expect of a performer.  Thus, for the most part that music need not be reviewed here. Those who thought that a new musical sensibility laid the foundations for a cultural or political revolution have long ago been proven wrong.That said, in the early 1960's there nevertheless was another form of musical sensibility that was directly tied to radical political expression- the folk revival. This entailed a search for roots and relevancy in musical expression. While not all forms of folk music lent themselves to radical politics it is hard to see the 1960's cultural rebellion without giving a nod to such figures as Dave Van Ronk, the early Bob Dylan, Utah Phillips, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie and others. Whatever entertainment value these performers provided they also spoke to and prodded our political development. They did have a message and an agenda and we responded as such. That these musicians' respective agendas proved inadequate and/or short-lived does not negate their affect on the times.As I have noted in my review of Dave Van Ronk's work when I first heard folk music in my youth I felt unsure about whether I liked it or not. As least against my strong feelings about the Rolling Stones and my favorite blues artist such as Howling Wolf and Elmore James. Then on some late night radio folk show here in Boston I heard Dave Van Ronk singing `Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies' and that was it. From that time to the present folk music has been a staple of my musical tastes. From there I expanded my play list of folk artists with a political message.Although I had probably heard Woody's `This Land is Your Land' at some earlier point I actually learned about his music secondhand from early Bob Dylan covers of his work.  While his influence has had its ebbs and flows since that time each succeeding generation  of folk singers still seems to be drawn to his simple, honest tunes about the outlaws, outcasts and the forgotten people that made this country, for good or evil what it is today.  Since Woody did not have a particularly good voice nor was he an exceptional guitar player the message delivered by his songs is his real legacy.Woody's relationship with the American Communist Party while no secret is not widely known. Even Bob Dylan, a worshipper of Woody's in his youth, was not aware of it. What is interesting is that the subjects of his songs fairly closely reflect the party line as it changed to reflect the winds blowing from Moscow. Woody's best work is reflected in the Popular Front style of ` This Land is Your Land' when the party developed its class collaborationist policy with the Rooseveltian Democratic Party and accordingly all liberals were good fellows and true. The Hitler-Stalin Pact was not good news for his style. Political differences between us aside, listen to his recordings and learn about hard times and struggle in an eraly period. A good set if you wish to listen to a person question Woody.Because of Arlo, 20 years ago I went to see a 1 man show of Woody Guthrie. The person that did the 1 man show did a great job. I say this because he made me want to know Woody's songs.This set was okay. I got to listen to Woody speak some of his thoughts.But for Woody music --- The Asch Recordings are excellent! This will knock the socks of any Woody Guthrie fans..Guaranteed!!  Woody himself is an American treasure;and any folk or traditional music lover will know that he was one of a kind and one of the best.Woody was born on June 14,1912.Many think he came from a poor background,but that was not the case.He was part of a large family and his father was quite well to do.His father had just built a large 16 room house .Shortly after, the house caught fire and burned to the ground.His father and a sister died in the fire.The mother never got over it and died later.The family was in ruins and the children were all put up  for adoption.After living with a couple of families;Woody ""hit the road"" in 1927 at the age of 17.He wandered around the Southwest and was in Texas when the Great Depression and the Dust Storms hit in 1934.He did a lot of odd jobs in the oil fields,farm laborer,etc;but developed a love of music which he applied to the hardships being experienced by people out of work,forced migration because of the Dust Storms and the Depression,travelled and lived the life of a hobo.His music was all about how the people srruggled to survive. In 1940,Woody was making a name for himself as a singer and songwriter of the music of the people,or Folk Music.Alan Lomax,was collecting Folk Music and working with Woody recorded his music.But these recordings are much more than a simple recording of his songs.There are about 3 hours on these 3 CD's but approximately half of the recordings consists of Alan and his wife Elizabeth interviewing Woody about his songs and his life on the road.From the discussions,it is apparent that Woody's reason for writing and singing these songs was not done for any commercial reason;but to make known to the country ,the problems that were being experienced throughout the land,and the need to change things.The technical quality of these recordings appear amateurish compared to today,but they are still very clear and this shortcoming only adds to the authenticity of Woody's music and what he was trying to do.Even if you already know much of Woody's music;you are in for a real treat if you have not heard these recordings.I have the the 4-Volume CD collection of ""ASHESmithonian Folkway Recordings"" which is also excellent (See My Review).It is a huge collection of 99 songs.;however only 2 of the songs on this Library of Congress are also on the ASCH collection.If you are a fan of Folk Music,and Woody Guthrie in particular,you don't want to miss this collection. As a historical document, indispensable.  Woody's  first recordings!  As a listening experience, sometimes a little tough going, sometimes even frustrating.  Poor micorphone placement compromises clarity of Woody's voice, both speech and singing. Sometimes a bad room echo obscures it even more, Woody doesn't always seem to be next to the microphone. Sound levels not adjusted when he's speaking as opposed to blowing harp and stumming away. Etc.These also are much looser performances than ""Dust Bowl Ballads"" (his seminal album, recorded a month after this Library Of Congress recording) or the amazing 1944-49 recordings for Mose Asch (the Asch Recordings box set)-Woody is mellow and laid back, frequently blows guitar chord changes to some of his best songs....no big deal! We still love him!  But the versions of most songs are better on ""Dust Bowl Ballads"" (exception: Talkin' Dust Bowl)  and especially the Moe Asch recordings (which is what I recommend starting out with).  It's great-fascinating-hearing long extended conversations with Woody Guthrie and Alan Lomax (even though it's not exactly loose conversation....it was intended to be broadcast as a radio series) It's conversational.....long and drawling.  It's beautiful. Woody  suddenly and unexpectedly describing his childhood tragedies is riveting.Three discs of loose version of song, followed by 5 minutes of conversation-sometimes it requires concentrated attention to really get the most out of.  Sometimes Alan himself joins in and sings with Woody.....it's that loose.If you've never gotten the Asch Recordings four disc set, that's the one I'd start with,  unbelievable.  All 4 discs are indispensable.  Woody with Cisco Houston is one of  musics great rewards, and he's on a lot of that set.  Add to that the equally indispensable Dust Bowl Ballads and you have the absolute essential Woody Guthrie.  After you've got those two under your belt, then I would pick up these Library of Congress recordings, I place it as number 3.A side note, Woody's harp playing is beautiful, I never see anyone mention that.Also, you can't program out the interviews So each track starts with a song and has up to 6 minutes of conversation.PS-I hope this doesn't sound like a bad review, because it's not!  It's an amazing documentary. It's one thing to hear Woody Guthrie perform his songs. His impromptu style (wherein he delays a few entries while he plays, seemingly because he's forgotten the words for a bit) belies his genius...or maybe even showcases it. Guthrie is one of a handful of musicians who can compose music--and perform it--on a moment's notice. If you're interested in this work, though, understand that the other aspect you get here is some detailed interviewing by folklorist Alan Lomax--which sets this recording apart. I myself stared at the speakers like radio listeners of the '20s and '30s, transfixed, like I was listening to stories told to me from a spiritual grandfather I never had known. His stories are alternately hilarious, wise, painful, and tragic--and utterly fascinating. The recording is not the best. The third CD in particular wavers due to an unevenly played vinyl or wax record, from which this set was recorded. However, the whole set does full justice to an American genius and an underappreciated musician. (Also recommended, if you enjoy these recordings: Bound for Glory, Guthrie's incredible autobiography.) This is a great CD as far as the music and Woody's comments about his life and his songs.  The interviewer, Alan Lomax, is difficult to hear, probably due to the placement of the microphone. I am glad that I bought the CD.","Pop,Folk,Traditional Folk",review used describe several woody guthries recordings although listened recordings represent best represent lifes poltical musical work musical tastes formed many generation rock roll exemplified rolling stones beatles blues revival delta chicago style however forms much gave pleasure marginally political best short entertainers performing material spoke us general sense one expect performer thus part need reviewed thought new musical sensibility laid foundations cultural political revolution long ago proven wrong said early nevertheless another form musical sensibility directly tied radical political expression folk revival thi review used describe woody guthries recordings listened recordings represent best represent lifes musical musical work work musical tastes formed generation rock roll exemplified rolling rolling stones stones beatles blues blues revival revival delta chicago chicago style style forms pleasure marginally political best short entertainers performing material spoke general sense expect need reviewed thought new musical sensibility laid foundations cultural political political revolution revolution long long ago proven wrong said early form musical sensibility directly tied radical political expression folk folk revival revival
97,221,B0000002S0,"Listening to The Carter Family on this album was like a trip back in time to an era when country music came from the country.  No fancy electric instruments here; no fancy backing tracks and synthesizers.  Just plain,  pure, down-to-earth country. The Carter Family sing about down home things,  like lost loves and lonliness, families and tragedies.  A P Carter's homely  voice (a little out of tune) blends with the sweet sounds of his wife and  sister-in-law in a combination that can only be described as  &quot;rustic&quot;.  Be warned, this is hard-core country - light years  away from what's called &quot;country&quot; today.  But if you want to hear  where Country came from - if you are interested in the beginings of country  music, and you want to travel back to a time where living was simple,  you'll do well to have a listen to this album - and you'll love it. This album features material from the Carters' second, third, and fourth Victor sessions, held in 1928 and 1929.  It is somewhat unpolished by comparison with later Carter sessions - particularly their Decca period of  1936 through 1938 - but it does contain some classic performances.  The  title song is well known, as is 'Foggy Mountain Top', but also noteworthy  are the railroad disaster ballad 'Engine 143', with its 30 second lead in  by Maybelle, and 'Forsaken Love', a duet by Sara and A.P. that was  originally issued as the 'A' side to the now legendary 'Wildwood Flower'.  Though the Carters tended to adapt and rearrange traditional songs and old  Victorian parlor ballads, this album contains at least one item that is a  definite A.P. Carter original. 'The Cyclone of Ryecove' centers on a  tornado that struck the tiny settlement of Ryecove, in Scott County,  Virginia, - just a few miles from A.P. and Sara's home in Maces Springs -  on May 2 1929. All in all, an interesting album that showcases the  emergence of a legendary Country group.  The performances are quite raw,  but they exhibit an almost innocent charm, whilst giving an insight into  the attitudes towards love, religion and homelife of an age long gone.  A  must for any dedicated Carter Family collector, and worthy of serious  consideration by any sincere student of the Country genre.","Classic Country,Country,Pop,Traditional Folk,Today's Country,World Music,Old-Time Country,Appalachian,North America,Folk",listening carter family like trip back time era country came country fancy electric instruments fancy backing synthesizers plain pure earth country carter family sing home things like lost loves lonliness families tragedies p carters homely voice little tune blends sweet sounds wife sister law combination described quot rustic quot warned hard core country light years away whats called quot country quot today want hear country came interested beginings country want travel back time living simple youll well listen youll love features material carters second third fourth victor sessions held somewhat unpolished comparison later carter sessions part listening carter family family trip time era country came country fancy electric electric instruments instruments fancy synthesizers plain pure earth country carter family family sing home things lost loves lonliness families tragedies homely voice tune blends sweet sounds wife sister law combination described rustic quot warned hard hard core core core country country light light years light years away years away whats called country quot today want hear country came interested country want travel time living simple listen love features material second fourth victor sessions held somewhat unpolished comparison later sessions
98,223,B0000002SC,"One of the gentlest and most appealing albums I have purchased in years. The combination of clever and humorous lyrical content with fine musical backing is very easy on the ears. Van Dyke Parks did a wonderful album in  the 70's called &quot;Discover America&quot;, where some of this material  was updated with &quot;Hollywood&quot; arrangements. It's great to be able  to hear the original source tracks. Calypso always educates you while you're dancing. Calypsonians inform, philosophize, speculate and entertain. They mount challenges and outright wars against each other (usually in a playful spirit). And it's all on this  recording. And the original giants of this seminal Trinidadian musical form  are all here: Lord Invader, Growling Tiger, King Radio, Lionel Belasco,  Caresser, Wilmouth Houdini and the very late Roaring Lion: musician,  scholar and author, who passed away this past year(1999). This CD is  Calypso madness! But madness you could put in the Smithsonian for all its  historical importance. In fact, the Smithsonian has committed a fair amount  of Calypso from this period to its archives. This is Calypso at a critical  stage, in that all its original cultural influences are right in your face.  Cyril Monrose and Lionel Belasco spent half their lives in Venezuela  playing the same music, so Trinidad's Spanish heritage is obviated. Greats  like Invader and Tiger draw heavily on the African kalinda songs (music  that accompanies an African style of martial arts, something like kapuera  in Brazil). Lion was the darling of the white creoles of Trinidad, always  dressed in suit and tie, his music shows various British and French  influences. My favorites on the recording are Baboolala by Lion about a  notorious pyromaniac, In the Dew and the Rain with it's irresistible tempo  and John Thomas (take your bundle and go) cuz that John Thomas is just bad  news! This music is from a time when the music of Latin America and the  Caribbean was just emerging from a more or less homogenous type into  distinct regional forms. This recording bears witness to those hip and  happening times. i am gonna tell you this, there is something about tracks like this that make me just forget that there is a modern life.  this album i listen to as sort of a time machine vibe.  i love the honest lyrics, the humor, and the crackly sound of the 78s.  what i could do without though is the instrumentals.  there is something about those violins that i do not particularly enjoy.  other than that, the album as a whole is quite a nice example of what true calypso sounds like.","Reggae,Calypso,Latin Music,World Music,Caribbean & Cuba,Trinidad",one gentlest appealing purchased years combination clever humorous lyrical content fine musical backing easy ears van dyke parks wonderful called quot discover america quot material updated quot hollywood quot arrangements great able hear original source calypso always educates youre dancing calypsonians inform philosophize speculate entertain mount challenges outright wars usually playful spirit recording original giants seminal trinidadian musical form lord invader growling tiger king radio lionel belasco caresser wilmouth houdini late roaring lion musician scholar author passed away past year cd calypso madness madness could put smithsonian historical importance fact smithsonian comm one appealing purchased years combination clever humorous lyrical content fine musical easy ears van dyke van dyke parks dyke parks wonderful called quot discover discover america america quot material updated hollywood quot arrangements great able hear original source calypso educates youre dancing calypsonians inform philosophize speculate entertain mount challenges outright wars usually playful spirit recording original giants seminal trinidadian musical musical form form lord invader invader growling growling tiger tiger king king radio radio lionel lionel belasco belasco caresser late roaring roaring lion lion musician scholar author passed passed away away past year cd calypso madness madness smithsonian historical importance fact smithsonian comm

100,239,B00000030W,"The songs on this CD were recorded in Fred McDowell's living room in Como, Mississippi two years prior to his ""discovery"" at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964. It's surprising that this recording was made by two college kids (and not intended for release by a label) and manages to sound so good. The clarity is that of a studio recording; this doesn't sound like a ""field recording"" by any means. Apparently Fred performed for hours during this recording for a room full of friends and neighbors, who are occasionally noticeable in the background but overall don't take away from the performance. The songs here are great too: an hour of Mississippi Fred McDowell and his acoustic slide guitar ripping through classics like ""Highway 61"", ""Good Morning Little Schoolgirl"", and a rousing ""Shake 'Em On Down"". If you like country blues or enjoy Delta blues players, you can't go wrong with this one. I love old Delta blues, but sometimes the poor sound quality of the early recordings puts me off. I just want to hear good music, not go on some sort of anthropological expedition, you know what I mean? This set of recordings, like the other reviewers say, was done with more modern equipment in the early 1960s, not the '30s or '40s.  And, although they were made in Fred's house, and were certainly mono, the quality is pleasantly high, especially the guitar. They remind of the ""house"" recordings of blues mandolinist Yank Rachell: clear with a real sense of immediacy.This disk is relatively inexpensive, and more than worth the money. If you enjoy Delta blues, soulful singing, and slide guitar, just buy it and enjoy. Fred McDowell is a legend in time. This CD is one of my greatest finds. The clarity and  background sounds make you feel that your right there. Its hard to believe one man could make much music and rythm. This is as real and as raw as it gets. I have some of his other CD's and this one is the best and I highly recommened it if you want to be impressed. Is there a better recording of acoustic guitar blues than this? If there is, please let me know in the comments, because this CD makes me feel like I'm in heaven.Fred must've had some great recording equipment in his living room because the sound is incredibly good. It sounds like he's sitting in the living room with me.At the same time, you can hear people talking in the background, and Fred coughs several times mid-take. Yet this lends to a raw and spontaneous ambiance to the music.There's a laugh-out-loud moment at the end of ""Shake 'Em On Down"" where Fred asks ""How'd you like that, buddy?"" to a friend. THAT was one of the most incredible slide guitar recordings ever! I had to play the track twice.A must-have for both blues and acoustic guitar fans. This is classic blues slide guitar.  Fred McDowell takes traditional country blues a step further, growing the roots of what would become rock and roll.  At first, the constant drone of his rhythms seemed monotonous, but the longer I listened to this CD, the more I appreciated it; using a cliche, it grew on me. Real country Blues that moves crisply forward with a rhythm that is indistinguishable from the music itself. Tight, succinct guitar playing. Slide guitar playing. The treble rings sharp and clear against the hollow  depth of wood. The vocal delivery, almost dry and terse, somehow couldn't  express more. You sense this music is coming from a very rich place. This  aint Chicago. This is real. I have a pile of early hill country blues recordings, and this is one of my faves! This is the real thing, complete with foot stomps on the floorboards, hoots and claps from the family in the living room, and Fred at his undiscovered best.  I cannot say enough about the depth and passion in this music, except that it does not grow old and reveals and comminicates again and again.  This is my favorite Fred McDowell recording; here is a glimpse of history most of us would never know, except indirectly. The blues is more than a musical genre; it is (was) for many people, what they were born into.  As much as I enjoy modern artists, with modern instruments, using modern techniques; I know that they, at best, are trying to copy a raw emotion.  This CD is that raw emotion; this is the blues as performed by someone born into the blues.  As quoted (on a CD title also) Fred will tell you ""I don't play no rock & roll"".  What Fred plays comes from the depths of his being and he sings and plays what he feels; not what he thinks you might like to hear.  So if you want to hear the blues, sung and played as it is felt; listen to this man. CD of terrific Blues Music Mississippi Fred Mcdowell.  His rhythms created the original rock and roll beat. This CD is very early and a good representation of his style. Reading the liner notes, it is commented about how Mississippi Fred was a point of entry for a lot people as their first foray into blues. I definitely see myself searching out for more of his and others blues, but it concerns me that anything else won't quite match or come close to this album. Listening closely through my headphonesGrado Prestige Series SR225i Headphonesyou can pick up on minor details and background noise-which is stated in the notes, that these things can be heard. What this fact says to me is just that more effort was put into the music itself, then making it sound a certain way. Overall it is a non-sterile sounding album. Highly recommend. This cd is is the best sounding,delta blues cd I have ever heard. Fred's playing is in top form &amp; this cd has most of his better known songs; A Must Have!!! I really like Fred; I listen to him a great deal, but. . . after all the hype, I expected this CD to be a world beater.  I was disappointed.The famed &#34;real, raw,&#34; and etc. eluded me.  I thought he sounded old and tired; it may have been the &#34;made at home&#34; format, but I did not like the CD. Fred McDowell's sound is organic and original. I find true soul in this music and I don't want to call it blues or put it in a genre because it is so unique. I have heard it called ""North Mississippi Style"" but then one thinks of Junior Kimbrough which is totally different. I think the best description was when he said ""I dont play no rock and roll y'all. I just play the straight natural blues"". I cant help but think when he said ""rock and roll"" he probably meant what most people call the Chicago Blues. Fred Mcdowell's music has reinvigorated my interest in folk music, particularly from the south. God Bless. R.I.P.

101,248,B00000034A,"This is an old CD by Marcia Ball.  It is enjoyable, and if you listen to her newer music, you can see the evolution.  I enjoy this album.  You can see that most of the band members have changed throughout the years.  We got to see Marcia Ball in person, and I've never seen anyone play piano like she does.  She enjoys performing which makes her music enjoyable for listeners. I was completely satisied with this tranaction. The product I recieved was as advertised. I arrived in a timely manner. Marcia Ball is one of the countless legend of rockers who have toured the Bars across American forever. She have made a living being a bar band.  The best thing about her concert is that at the end of the evening, as you walking to your car, about all you can say is ""wow, that was fun.""  This pretty much somes her up.  Her free style, top tapping, good time show, is captured here on this album. Starting with teh sone ""Never like this before"" and running to ""Un-Uh Baby"".  If you are not a fan of her music, then this is a great place to start. From the opening track, Never like this before (a cover of a sixties soul song), this album rocks. Marcia wrote two of the songs herself (Love's spell and That's enough of that stuff) and draws on a variety of sources for the other songs, including soul, R+B, blues and zydeco - the latter represented by the title track, originally written by Clifton Chenier.Yet the overall feel of the album is rock'n'roll update for 1985 (when this album was recorded). Comparisons with Jerry Lee Lewis are understandable - Marcia plays the piano in a similar style to Jerry. Not much tinkling of the ivories here - they take a real pounding on some of the tracks.Although this is a very upbeat album, there are a few slower songs to vary the pace, and Marcia is well capable of singing those as well as the rockers.This is one of Marcia's earliest albums, but it still sounds fresh and exciting. Rock your blues away with this or any other album by Marcia, who is brilliant at what she does. Awesome nostalgic glimpse of a musician-in-waiting who has evolved into one of today's greatest entertainers. Well worth the trip down memory lane. I fell in love with this artist when I happened to see her on a PBS show some time ago. She is so much fun--full of energy and a style that demands one get out on the floor and dance.","Chicago Blues,Regional Blues,Pop,Texas Blues,Electric Blues,Modern Blues,New Orleans Blues,Blues,Piano Blues",old cd marcia ball enjoyable listen newer see evolution enjoy see band members changed throughout years got see marcia ball person ive never seen anyone play piano like enjoys performing makes enjoyable listeners completely satisied tranaction product recieved advertised arrived timely manner marcia ball one countless legend rockers toured bars across american forever made living bar band best thing concert end evening walking car say wow fun pretty much somes free style top tapping good time show captured starting teh sone never like running un uh baby fan great place sta old cd marcia marcia ball ball enjoyable listen newer see evolution enjoy see band members changed years got see marcia ball ball ball person person seen play piano enjoys performing enjoyable listeners completely product advertised arrived timely manner marcia ball ball countless legend rockers toured bars american forever living bar bar band band best concert end walking car say wow fun pretty pretty much free style tapping good good time time show captured starting teh sone running baby fan great place
102,250,B00000034K,"Loved Marcia Balls other worksbut this unexciting, but with a bitmore pizzaz than Roadside Attractions.She keeps falling into the trap ofpotboiling sounds and rhythms - thoughsome differences on this album I like Marcia Ball and love her music. I see her around town now and then and have gone to many of her local gigs.  However, eighteen bucks for 34 minutes of music is a nasty rip off.  Folks, that is worse than a cheaply mastered LP! Rounder (more like Bounder) records conveniently neglects to list a total time, or track times, on the exterior packaging so you have to open the package before you learn you've just been seriously gouged and it's too late to take it back then.  It's companies like Rounder that are driving the various sorts of music piracy. I've just sort of stumbled upon Marcia, but man, she has some dynamic energy to her music, but can also belt out a soft beautiful vocal. I've seen her live and she puts on one hell of a show. I highly recommend this CD if you want some great up tempo b;lues. Marcia Ball is just one Lady that Jamms and is so much fun to listen to.When I need to be in a up mood,Ohhhhh my goodness Marcia is the best to get me there..I do believe she received a Grammy for this album, if not this one it's been a recent one.She is New Orleans, She is Blues for anywhere in America or the World.I have most of her albums and listen to her often.Try doing the same,I am sure she will have you up and smiling,Cause she sure has fun doing what she is doing so well....Great, Great, is what I will say.I love the South and she sure brings those Southern Blues out.You keep going girl,You are fantastic.

There's nothing else quite like that here, but there is a nice mix of tempos. The mood of the album is generally upbeat.The power of love is her own song - of course, there have been many songs with this title - I've come across about ten totally different songs. The most famous was the one that was a huge hit all over Europe in the eighties for Jennifer Rush. It was a flop in America, but later became an American hit for Laura Branigan, then in the nineties it became a monster hit for Celine Dion. Marcia's song is not as dramatic, but it is still a great song.Mama's cooking explains in song why Marcia manages to avoid getting fat - she could eat plenty, but always burn off the excess by dancing the night away. The cover picture provides the proof.Lee Roy Parnell, who eventually achieved success as a country singer in the nineties, wrote two of the songs but he was unknown at the time this music was recorded. What's a girl to do and Red hot show that he could write great songs.Marcia's music should appeal to anybody who likes rock music with a touch of blues, particularly fans of Bonnie Raitt. I heard from Marcia on a Blues webcast.I bought 3 of her albums including her Live Down the Road. It was mainly based on a single review on the album page."" Great sax on the many solos"".. That sax man is awful. Bad notes, phrasing, and amature style. Gator rhythms was not what I expected either. Marcia is a terrific talent we saw in Bay St Louis some time back before the town was blown away. These Albums miss the mark. sorry. There's something haunting and envigorating about her style. Even though you can get lost in her vocals don't forget her piano playing, which is second to none. She's just a true musician. I had this CD years ago, then lost it.  Now I have it again and love it as much as always. This is the best of the cds put out by Marcia Ball and I recommend it highly.  The performances on other Ball cds is equally good, but the quality of the songwriting on this one sets it apart from the rest. (I  realize 4 stars around here amounts to damning with faint praise, but geez,  there ought to be some shades of gray between the ridiculous and the  sublime). Have you ever seen Marcia Ball?

103,251,B00000034U,"This Album followed the good &quot;Fame and Wealth&quot; and was followed by &quot;Therapy&quot;, the first of a long, unbroken string of incredible recordings. It's damn good. Damn, damn good. The productions are in-hand--no sloppy, overdone nonsense here--and the album almost has the kind of consistent &quot;shape and feel&quot; that the later ones would.It's easier to point out the one song that's sort of jarring and more &quot;old-school&quot; Loudon: The harsh &quot;Man's World&quot;. Loudon is so good at communicating contempt in his songs when he feels it, it can be uncomfortable to listen to.Otherwise, this is an upbeat album. &quot;A Hard Day On The Planet&quot;, for all its nihilism, is bursting with humorous energy. &quot;Synchronicity&quot; tackles the embarrassing and amusing social awkwardness that comes from discovering the girl you're hitting on is a lesbian. Other funny, upbeat songs on the album are the anthem to the solo-diners, &quot;I Eat Out&quot;, &quot;No&quot; (about the futility of resisting strong-minded women), &quot;The Acid Song&quot; (self-explanatory), &quot;Vampire Blues&quot; (also self-explanatory), the gentle, self-mocking &quot;Expatriate&quot;, and &quot;Back Nine&quot;, which applies a sort-of slave-labor mentality to golfing (something which should have been done a long time ago).This is a happy album, really. And as much as I love Loudon's new stuff, I would like to see him get (emotionally, as an artist) to a place where he could do something similar again.The less-than-happy songs are mostly standouts, too:&quot;Your Mother and I&quot; is a classic, and probably should be required listening for any child whose parents are divorcing.&quot;The Home Stretch&quot; is the other rough spot on the album. It's really a great song, but it's harsh, old-school Loudon, angry and uncomfortable.&quot;Overseas Call&quot; is a wonderful song of longing.&quot;Unhappy Anniversary&quot;, like &quot;Hard Day&quot;, for me, captures a lot of what's best about this album. It's not about a happy topic, but it's a happy tune. At this point Loudon is combining his highly-polished lyric-writing abilities with his facility for writing in a wide range of musical styles to create effects one just doesn't get from run-of-the-mill songwriters.A five-star review is not out of place here, and this probably ought to be at least 4 1/2 stars, but there's gotta be room at the top for the albums that come next. I tend to associate rock and roll with a particular style of thought, but when I try to come up with something deep, it is difficult to surpass the kind of humor exhibited in songs like Synchronicity, The Acid Song, and No. Subjectivity can be shared at levels that are so individual, people just sit in awe when they have the chance to listen. I like knowing a CD so well that I can look at the list of song titles and know what each song is like. Most of these songs are that real for me. MORE LOVE SONGS is one of the very best 80's Loudon Wainwrightalbums I think.  Great balance of witty songs like &quot;Synchronicity&quot; or &quot;No&quot; &amp; touching ones like &quot;Your Mother&amp; I&quot; or &quot;Unhappy Anniversary.&quot; Also 'bonus' of stellar help from a bunch of English folk musicians like Richard Thompson,John Kirkpatrick &amp; Danny Thompson.  Only the 'kvetchy' near-protest song &quot;Hard Day on the Planet&quot; doesn't quite measureup IMO.  He has other great ones, esp. in the '90's, but thisis really very good I think. From Woodstock as a Bob Dylan look-alike until now, the years haven't hurt him.  Live or on CD his haunting songs stay with us.  This one is among the most haunting.  But of course, I'm prejudiced.  I've sat in the audience of many of his performances in major US cities with a hundred other of his fans wondering why there weren't more (but glad there weren't for personal, selfish reasons).  His audiences comprise a surprising span of old fogies such as myself and young people who think they discovered him.Loudon's as good on this one as he gets (and that's good). As is usual with Loudon Wainwright (and, I suppose, many singer-songwriters), a couple songs are just fantastic (usually the funny ones in Wainwright's case) and worth buying the cd for, while the serious songs tend to be maudlin and uninteresting (musically or intellectually).  This cd is no exception.  I guess this is one reason people buy individual titles on the web. This was the first Loudon Wainwright album I heard, and it's still my favourite. The lyrics are bittersweet and often hilarious, the music is good if simple, and the bassline on the first track (Hard Day on the  Planet) is great.Other LWIII albums can get a bit noisy, and the lyrics  a little too self-obsessed, but this one strikes a good balance. Very few  duff songs.","Singer-Songwriters,Contemporary Folk,Pop,Folk",followed good quot fame wealth quot followed quot therapy quot first long unbroken string incredible recordings damn good damn damn good productions hand sloppy overdone nonsense almost kind consistent quot shape feel quot later ones would easier point one thats sort jarring quot old school quot loudon harsh quot mans world quot loudon good communicating contempt feels uncomfortable listen otherwise upbeat quot hard day planet quot nihilism bursting humorous energy quot synchronicity quot tackles embarrassing amusing social awkwardness comes discovering girl youre hitting lesbian funny upbeat anthem solo diners quot eat quot quot quot futility resisting strong minde followed good quot fame wealth quot followed quot therapy quot long unbroken string incredible recordings damn good damn damn good productions hand sloppy overdone nonsense kind consistent quot shape feel quot later ones point sort jarring quot old old school school quot harsh quot mans world quot good communicating contempt feels uncomfortable listen upbeat quot hard day planet quot nihilism bursting humorous energy quot synchronicity quot tackles embarrassing amusing social awkwardness comes discovering girl youre hitting lesbian funny upbeat anthem solo diners eat quot quot quot futility resisting strong minde
104,255,B000000360,"Judging by the other reviews, this album provokes mixed reactions. Personally, I love it. The compositions are wonderful and original, particularly &quot;Mille Valles&quot; and &quot;Agadiramadan&quot;. And the other musicians are masterful, particularly Didier Malherbe's flute and sax, and Binet's fretless bass.I came to this one after buying some of the earlier albums. I didn't much like the Celtic stuff - perhaps because it seemed affected and unrealistic after years of listening to genuine Celtic artists - a bit like hearing a Japanese banjo player who has learned out of books. I did like Musiques and Solilai, though, particularly the tunes which foreshadowed Spices. but not bad.  This album heralds his move away from what he does best (IMHO) and that is arrange and play predominantly Celtic or Celtic influenced compositions.  If you are more interested in &quot;New Age&quot;  styled music, then this is for you, although I would argue that anything  from P.B. is far more rewarding than 99% of what is commonly labeled  &quot;New Age&quot;.  If, on the other hand your interests lean more toward  Celtic fingerstyle guitar, start with Solilai (perhaps his best), then go  to &quot;2&quot; and/or Early Pierre Bensusan (perhaps THESE are his  best?), and if you've found a new love continue on to Musiques and maybe Wu  Wei.  They are all worthy of purchase, but this order will serve you well,  again IMHO.  I would also HIGHLY recommend seeing him live as his shows are  so beautiful, and if you play guitar, so humbling.  Enjoy! I have nearly 500 CD's, made up primarily of acoustic guitar.  As a player and fan of acoustic guitar musicians, I have to say that this is one of the finest CD's I own! This is actually the 1988 debut album of Bensusan's jazz ensemble.  In addition to featuring Pierre Bensusan's notable guitar work, the group includes Emmanuel Binet (bass), Denis Benharrosh (percussion),  Didier Malherbe (sax), George Al Safi (violin), Frank Sitbon and Mico Nissim (piano &amp; keyboards), and Doatea Bensusan and Shandy Sinnamon (vocals).  Some, like Malherbe and Nissim are well known, especially in Europe, but all do solid work backing up Bensusan as well as displaying their individual skills.The range of styles is quite broad as well.  For the most part light jazz with a touch of swing is the standard (La Cour Interieure), but you will find dashes of caf&eacute; accordion, funk (Agadiramadan), Celtic (Shi Bhig Shi Mhor), and, just went you've relaxed, an reel or two (The Last Pint).  As is usually the case, Bensusan serves up an eclectic mix aimed at pleasing (and showing off) rather than representing a particular trend.Also as usual is Bensusan's strong, thoughtful play.  He has never been a guitarist to simplify a melody just to make it more digestible.  Instead he relies on his skill as a performance artist to build his popularity.  He shows, even on his early albums, the talent which later blossoms into the kind of playing that attracts a wide range of interests and avoids the extremes of shallowness or inaccessibility. Yuk.  Not because of Pierre Bensusan's efforts.  In fact i respect and understand his attempt to try something a bit different.  The problem is, I just dont like this kind of music.This is not solo guitar with some  vocals like his other albums,  this is fully produced, jazzy-mainstream new  agey music.  It would work well in an office or elevator setting.NOT the  heart felt solo guitar chops and vocal genius that his other recordings  capture.  If you get the pleasure of listening to any of his other albums,  you will think its an entirely different musician.  This is so different, i  have to say its Pierre Bensusan, &quot;NOT&quot;!I reccomend ANY  other album by Bensusan, besides this one.  Unless, of course, you enjoy  mild, new-agey, jazz instrumental albums...if thats the case then you may  like it. My first and favourite Pierre Bensusan CD.  Milles Vallees & Alimatou take you out of your (small ""m"") mind.  Agadiramadan & Les Voiles de Catalan are full on production and I daresay, romantic!  If you're a hardcore, wood only, solo guitar fan you may only enjoy a few of these tracks.  That was how I felt when I purchased Spices nineteen years ago...it grows on you however and one soon comes to see Pierre is his own genre.  Jaw dropping technique no matter how you look at it. This is maybe the most intense mellow fusion album ever made. A masterpiece yes, beyond any doubt but also both unique and uniquely diverse among the over 5000 albums I have in my archives. The CD has great sound quality and masterful production as on most of Bensusan's releases. And yes, there are rock influences and Bensusan has always had that influence, but it doesn't overpower anything and neither does the jazz influence or the spirit of Jaco in the basslines, it's truly a perfect blend of a myriad, maybe a thousand different influences from all directions. Every tune here is a great, adventurous, progressive composition despite the fact that it's accessible, always melodic and easy to listen to and a child can enjoy it. It's when you keep listening that you discover more and more and realize that not an ounce of compromise went into any of this accessibilty and you can literally play this album 10 times in a row from beginning to end and never get bored because it is also very complex and almost contains the whole world in it and nothing else is needed. Incredibly virtuosic and intricate playing from Bensusan and his gang of master European musicians . These are not jazz musicians per-se, they are the kind of musicians that fall between disciplines and are adept at playing any style, sort of like Bensusan himself. But Bensusan is the captain of this ship, the guy who shows all these other musicians how to achieve true transcendence and synergy. If this is 'elevator music' as one of the tone-deaf previous reviewers seems to so smugly declare, then it is on the same level of quality as Mozart whose music is also played in elevators and supermarkets as background. My introduction to Pierre was with this album and Solilai.  I found both to be refreshingly different, both from other music in my collection, and from each other.  I don't particularly care for track 7.  No particular reason, I just don't.  I would not categorize this as THE must-have Bensusan over the rest of his discography.  I wouldn't care to hear it in an office setting, either ... it's much too lively and varied.  It plays like a soundtrack, so put it on when you've 40 or so minutes to spare, and write a screenplay in your head, just for fun ...","Instrumental,Jazz Fusion,Jazz,Pop,New Age,World Music,Meditation",judging reviews provokes mixed reactions personally love compositions wonderful original particularly quot mille valles quot quot agadiramadan quot musicians masterful particularly didier malherbes flute sax binets fretless bass came one buying earlier didnt much like celtic stuff perhaps seemed affected unrealistic years listening genuine celtic artists bit like hearing japanese banjo player learned books like musiques solilai though particularly tunes foreshadowed spices bad heralds move away best imho arrange play predominantly celtic celtic influenced compositions interested quot new age quot styled although would argue anything p b far rewarding commonly labeled quot judging reviews provokes mixed mixed reactions reactions personally love compositions wonderful original particularly quot musicians masterful particularly didier malherbes malherbes flute sax binets fretless fretless bass bass came buying earlier celtic stuff seemed affected unrealistic years listening genuine celtic celtic artists artists bit hearing japanese banjo player learned books particularly tunes foreshadowed spices bad heralds away best arrange play predominantly celtic celtic influenced compositions interested quot new age quot styled argue far rewarding commonly labeled quot

106,258,B000000366,"From a very short piano-'demonstration'by Marcia Ball in a tv-documentary on the history of blues, I had hoped that she would be a blues-pianist, singing a little bit with her piano-performance.However, she turns out to be a singer, also playing the piano, but no solo's, so her playing the piano is 'drowned' by the other more dominant instruments.Stil a very nice CD though.The other 2 CD's which I bought were recorded in later years, and show that she is gradually 'leaving'the blues in favor of 'country'. I discovered Marcia Ball who was a piano player in New Orleans about 20 years ago.  I have enjoyed all her cds. I found this one by accident, but it turned out to be a great find.  I was in a used CD store and picked up a CD by Luther Allison. It had been repackaged and shrink wrapped.  When I popped it into the CD player, out came this very vibrant female voice singing a song that I would later find out is called Red Beans.  It caught my attention and in what seemed like no time at all, I was through the entire CD.  I played it twice more before I finally managed to find out who this was and print out a list of tracks.Every track is great and my favorite of the bunch is Fingernails.  Since then, I have gotten more Marcia Ball CDs (on purpose!!) and can't say anything negative about her. Marcia is a fine singer who writes many of her own songs, though she is never afraid to record covers where they are suitable. Her albums can be almost relentlessly upbeat, as with Hot tamale baby, but this is generally a much sadder album - more like one would expect from a blues singer.Marcia still demonstrates her Jerry Lee-ish piano playing here, on the opening Red beans, the third track Down the road and particularly on her cover of Joe Ely's Fingernails, but those are not typical of this particular album.More typical is the title track, in which Marcia painted her house blue after her man left for good, or St Gabriel, about being sent to prison and later being released with nowhere to go.This is a fine album that demonstrates Marcia's ability to sing a variety of different types of song. St. Gabriel should be the poster song for battered wives... and all the other songs are wonderful too.  Heard her songs at the House of Blues website ... and craved some more.  I shall buy this one here and also Gator too.  Recommend her for anyone who loves the Blues! thought I'd would from hearing her interview and excerpts at the House of Blues.  &quot;St. Gabriel&quot; still sings to me, but there is not one bad track on this CD, and will play them all over and over.  Not all CDs past that test.  Sometimes I'll buy a CD and only like one or two tracks.Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.","Chicago Blues,Regional Blues,Pop,Texas Blues,Electric Blues,Modern Blues,New Orleans Blues,Blues,Piano Blues",short piano demonstrationby marcia ball tv documentary history blues hoped would blues pianist singing little bit piano performance however turns singer also playing piano solos playing piano drowned dominant instruments stil nice cd though cds bought recorded later years show gradually leavingthe blues favor country discovered marcia ball piano player new orleans years ago enjoyed cds found one accident turned great find used cd store picked cd luther allison repackaged shrink wrapped popped cd player came vibrant female voice singing would later find called red beans caught attention seemed like time entire cd pl short piano marcia ball ball tv tv documentary documentary history blues hoped blues blues pianist pianist singing little bit bit piano performance turns singer playing piano piano solos solos playing piano drowned dominant instruments nice cd cds bought recorded later years show gradually blues favor country discovered marcia ball ball piano piano player player new orleans years years ago enjoyed cds found accident turned great find used cd store picked cd luther luther allison repackaged shrink wrapped popped cd cd player player came vibrant female voice singing later find called red red beans beans caught attention seemed time entire cd

She does great on these honky-tonk songs. Here's a gem from the Bakersfield Mob that still outshines just about everybody else 13 years later. This is Rosie Flores' solo LP debut, with 6 extra  tracks from the follow up that never was (for Warner, that is). Warner didn't know what to do with her in late 80's. Some things never change: The reissue is on Rounder.If you can buy the idea that country music could (can) be progressive, this is a great example. A mix of covers and originals, all of the tracks are great. ""Crying Over You"" is a great opener. ""Midnight To Moonlight"" is thoroughly grounded in her San Antonio roots, with great accordian work from David Hidalgo (Los Lobos). ""God May Forgive You  (But I Won't)"" absolutely aches.If you like traditional country (or) Mandy Barnett's second record, you definitely need to check this out.

110,264,B0000003EN,"I enjoy ""fiddle"" music, and this is one of the best selections I've heard in many years. Natalie MacMasters does a wonderful job of not only showing off her talents, but the selections chosen for this CD are fantastic. I had read this is one of her best CD's, and now I have experienced it all first-hand. Hats off to Natalie, and keep making great CD's for listening pleasure. Natalie MacMaster's music will lift your spirits any time, but don't miss a chance to see her perform onstage. She is a terrific entertainer as well as a masterful musician. The best music brings to mind images of times both happy and sad, and no one,absolutly NO ONE... can do this better than Natalie MacMaster.  This CD is, as its title states, a compilation from two earlier releases and is  more traditional in scope than her more recent releases. The musical images  abound through every song here, the green fields of Ireland, the  mist-covered highlands of Scotland and of course, Natalies' home,the island  of Cape Breton, which can be justly proud of the music of its most famous  daughter(and also truly one of its best good-will ambassadors.)These tunes  reflect Natalie's roots and her pride in them is in every note played. Do  not miss any of this talented lady's music...... The same energy that she exibited as a teenager dancing/clogging and fiddle playing she brings with her to this album. Originally from Cape Breton Newfoundland, she wraps contemporary instruments such as a Base, acoustic guitar, piano, Sax(?) around her sizzling fiddle playing and tradition cadences.I believe this album, or (Fit as A Fiddle) even brings vocals into the mix.If you haven't seen her in Concert do. She shure can dance, and boy the snake skin pants don't hurt none either! Natalie MacMaster's first is arguably her best work.  Every &#34;tune&#34; is full of energy and great, great fiddling.

111,265,B0000003FT,"My fifth wife and our youngster really find this double disc set a special treat on our travels.  Chad gets a kick out of our gleeful singing and even makes animal sounds to go along with the cute lyrics to these fun songs.  I am particularly taken with song four from disc one, but am a tad alarmed by the trio (songs 17, 18, and 19) of tunes on disc two.  'Swapping' really got me into some hot water with wife number four.  Nevertheless, these are fun folk songs and excellent for those long cross country trips in the beat up Volkswagon Van!! My two nephews love these CDs, they listen to them all the time!  The songs are very cute and there's a nice rhythm to the songs which I think little kids are drawn to. I picked up this CD when I met Peggy Seeger a number of years ago. I was doing research on her mother Ruth Seeger at the time. Little did I know that ten years later my own daughter would love these songs. She dances and sings to them. Her favorite are ""Mr. Rabbit"", ""Raccoon and Possum"", ""Snake Baked a Hoecake"", ""Little Rooster"", and... Okay, she loves almost all of them. LOLI highly recommend this CD. Ruth Crawford Seeger wrote a book with the same title as this album that the book inspired. Ruth died in her early fifties, but she would be proud of this album, which was recorded by some of her children and grandchildren. While a variety of instruments are used throughout the album, there are a maximum of four on any one track, and usually fewer.This is a fun album that children (and maybe adults) can sing along to, or make animal noises if they prefer. The most recognizable song here is probably Stewball, the song revived most famously by Peter Paul and Mary. The booklet notes are interesting, albeit a little political in places; this is a Seeger album, so no surprise there.When I originally bought this album, I wondered if it was mainly for adults reminiscing about their childhood, or whether modern children still enjoy these old song. I was reassured by other reviews that modern children do still enjoy these songs just as much as earlier generations, but those adults who want to take themselves back in time can also enjoy this album.","Classic Country,Contemporary Folk,Country,Children's Music,Pop,Traditional Folk,Old-Time Country,Folk",fifth wife youngster really find double disc set special treat travels chad gets kick gleeful singing even makes animal sounds go along cute lyrics fun particularly taken four disc one tad alarmed trio tunes disc two swapping really got hot water wife number four nevertheless fun folk excellent long cross country trips beat volkswagon van two nephews love cds listen time cute theres nice rhythm think little kids drawn picked cd met peggy seeger number years ago research mother ruth seeger time little know ten years later daughter would love dances sings favorite mr rabbit raccoon possum snake baked hoecake little rooster fifth wife youngster really find double double disc disc set special treat travels chad kick gleeful singing animal sounds go along cute lyrics fun particularly disc disc one tad alarmed trio tunes disc swapping really got hot hot water water wife number number four fun folk excellent long cross cross country country trips beat nephews love cds listen time cute nice rhythm think little kids kids drawn picked cd met peggy peggy seeger seeger number years years ago research mother ruth seeger seeger time know years years later later daughter love dances sings favorite mr mr rabbit rabbit raccoon possum snake baked hoecake rooster

The Stray Cats bring a kinda rockabilly to the national airwaves. But for the reefer chuggin, beer swillin roadhouse sound, Austin turned to the Le Roi brothers. Rythm on a Les Paul Jr, lead on a Tele, these cats weren't no posers, man they threw it through the wall. Drummers, listen up- Mike Buck is the King. Glorious 4 piece music. Bob Dylan, ask Charlie Sexton about these guys.... Looky here, chump-change, I dig the LeRois the most, to say the least! Always have, ever since I saw 'em @ Club Lingerie in Hollywood back in '83. After moving to Tucson, I caught 'em there a number of times & we became fast friends. Kindred spirits in the passion-ation of all things ""American Roots"". They've been carryin' that torch for decades, bless 'em. ""Check This Action"" is a bold statement of dungeree bop'n'roll w/ goofer dust sprinkled on it. Git it now, Ace while they're still available. In fact, buy 'em by the sack & spread a little joy during this ""Kool Yule"". Shout outs to Mike Buck & the whole gang. Kozmic Cheerz, Kidd Squidd My first brush with the LeRois was when I picked up their &quot;Forget About The Danger...&quot; EP, which blew me away back in '84. I then immediately searched out Check This Action, which had been released the previous year on the local Jungle Records label. Rounder records subsequently released the 13-song collection on CD in 1994, and I have both versions...This is a great rock &amp; roll record, featuring some excellent guitar and vocal work by both Steve Doerr and Don Leady (who later went on to form the Tail Gators, a wonderful swamp-rock outfit)...&quot;Are You With Me Baby (Say Yeah),&quot; &quot;Chicken and Honey,&quot; &quot;Steady With Betty, &quot;Rockin' Daddy&quot; and &quot;Eternally Blue&quot; are all endlessly listenable (although I prefer the EP version of &quot;Eternally&quot;); and Leady apparently enjoyed doing &quot;Til It's Too Late&quot; on this album so much that he later recorded it with the Tail Gators as well (and why not?--it's a great song!). I once saw the LeRois and the Blasters in concert together; though in all honesty the Blasters may be the best live outfit there is, the Brothers weren't far behind. Highly recommended. This is definitive LeRoi brothers and the action doesn't get any better than this.All the fantastic cuts from the original album are here plus a rough take of ""Eternally Blue"" that previews it's more refined version which appears on their follow-up EP.  I recommend that you ""Check this Action"" !! This is a very good rock and roll record, but ""jbesanko"" is right, ""Forget About the Danger..."" is the high water mark for the LeRoi's.  They really made a big noise on that one - ""Pretty Little Lights of Town"" and ""Eternally Blue"".  Great stuff.  I had ""Forget About.."" on cassette back in the 1980s, and I cannot find it anywhere now.  I assume it is out of print.

114,274,B0000003LD,"I was walking through a record store one fine day and when this album was just out and froze in my tracks. I turned to the store owner and said ""excuse me, are they playing the Hokey Pokey?""The store owner said ""Yep. Thats Brave Combo!""I immediately said ""I'd be stupid not to buy this!""What I got was an album full of classic group dance songs. From the Hokey Pokey to the Chicken Dance to the Hustle.

In their search for artistic differentiation the band has thrown in quite a few twists that, while they sound interesting, make it a bit hard to dance to.  That's not cool for an album titled &quot;Group Dance Epidemic.&quot;Still, it's a great kid's album and highly recommended. If you want a band that stays in one style and groove, forget it! A person could get stylistic whiplash off of this CD. The jump from Mana Vu to The Jeffrey comes to mind. The thing is though it is all played with real joy and passion, something most recordings are devoid of these days.

Have some FUN! The least favourite of the three albums I have (Kiss of Fire; No, No, No Cha Cha Cha; and this one). It's jaunty, but just doesn't have the punch of the others. Brave Combo never ceases to amaze me. Even though I have had this CD for a number of years, I have recently been listening to it routinely because it always puts me in a better mood. If you think that the world's greatest modern polka band would be a drag, think again. This CD is full of Brave Combo's best work, and crosses many musical boundaries in the process. My personal favorites are ""O Holy Night Cha Cha Cha,"" which is exactly what you would believe it to be given the title, ""Habanera Rock,"" an up-tempo re-rendering of a Latin classic, ""Gigi,"" a wonderful and peculiar show tune (and I am someone who generally detests musicals), the African influenced ""Skokiaan,"" ""Sixteen Tons"" done as an upbeat quasi-polka (certain to startle anyone familiar with the original), and my very favorite of all, the Doors classic ""People Are Strange,"" a truth which will be more evident than ever after hearing this version, which is not at all what Jim Morrison had in mind.Some of these are live and some are studio recordings, but the musicianship is first rate throughout. The band emphasizes unusual treatments of well known titles, intermixed with pleasantly surprising originals. Think of Brave Combo as Weird Al for intellectuals, or perhaps as Lawrence Welk for metalheads, although no categorization can really do them justice. This is the best CD to use as an introduction, but I warn you, this music is very addictive.","Alternative Rock,Europe,Indie Rock,Classical,Eastern Europe,Indie & Lo-Fi,Polka,Polkas,Ballets & Dances,Pop,World Music,Rock,American Alternative",blast intelligent deep thoughtful dissertation simple earnest command buy cd everyone always asks listening playing great kick pants fun least favourite three kiss fire cha cha cha one jaunty doesnt punch others brave combo never ceases amaze even though cd number years recently listening routinely always puts better mood think worlds greatest modern polka band would drag think cd full brave combos best work crosses many musical boundaries process personal favorites holy night cha cha cha exactly would believe given title habanera rock tempo rendering latin classic gigi wonderful peculiar show tune someone generally detests musicals blast intelligent deep thoughtful dissertation simple earnest command buy cd asks listening playing great kick pants fun favourite kiss fire cha cha cha cha cha cha jaunty punch brave brave combo combo ceases amaze cd number years recently listening routinely better mood think worlds worlds greatest greatest modern polka band drag think cd full brave brave combos combos best best work work crosses musical boundaries process personal favorites holy holy night night cha cha cha cha cha cha exactly believe title habanera rock tempo rendering latin classic gigi wonderful peculiar show show tune tune generally detests musicals

While the new guy is good and Sugar Ray was great I don't know why people forget or don't mention the great sound Roomful had when Greg Piccolo was at the vocal mic.  He's also a brilliant songwriter listen to the unbelievable r&b tune What Happened To The Sugar... the clever He Knows The Rules (I swear she told me she was 21!) and the tight and funky Whiplash.  That's just a few of the gems on this disc.  There's a great Kim Wilson (from the Fab T Birds) cameo as well on The Last Time.  Just an excellent Roomful album!  If you can order this one get it.

118,283,B0000003PA,"I shall add my voice to Mr. Welding's.I'd thought that this was a tribute recording- and was very pleased to come across it and see it is original. The first two tracks are not particularly inspiring, especially if you are familiar with the lovely genius of his various recordings of Steamboat Gwine Round De Bend. But I thought to myself: just relax and enjoy this as itself, instead of demanding that this music be something else.However, I needn't have developed any ""forgiving"" attitude, since the rest of this recording is well worth our abiding interest.And there are certainly passages of serious syncopation, folks!A wide variety of music, sounds and styles.I have recently (after hearing Mr. Fahey's collection Yes, Jesus Loves Me! several times) enjoyed Fahey's deconstruction of straightforward time signatures. No doubt some of the hymns have this feature, with elongated measures such as In Christ There Is No East Or West presented.But here he brings this concept to several pieces. I get a kick out of not knowing what might come next, as he runs several pieces through completely unexpected chord and mood changes. An interesting recording that nobody should hesitate to purchase, and I believe lovers of Fahey will welcome. It isn't slick, but it's good. Fahey explained this disaster by saying that he had a virus when it was recorded and during the playback. It's a very poor album, full of bum notes and uninspiring playing. There's plenty of potentially good material, but it's really an object lesson against recording things when you're ill. His producer should have called on him to re-record it when he was better. It's too late now, of course. John was quite ill when he made this record, and it shows. There's no inspiration, and no syncopation. Everything is tired, flat, listless, dull. You'll never find a more apt title on anyone's album than &quot;Minutes Seem Like Hours, the Hours Seem Like Days&quot;. So this is for completists only. As the album title itself says &quot;I Remember 'Blind Joe Death'&quot; - now THAT was a great album! it's fairly disingenuous to say that john fahey shouldn't have recorded this because he was sick.  furthermore, to say fahey himself wrote this album off isn't entirely relevant, since he didn't look back to his early takoma lp's for inspiration later in life, particularly when he was recording his 'red cross' and 'womblife' records.  to say this isn't as good as the earlier 'blind joe death' is to misunderstand the essence of fahey's musical evolution.  at this stage in his life, he was fighting off the oft-misunderstood (yet nevertheless debilitating) epstein-barr virus.  perhaps some reviewers would rather he did not record this album, but it is a window on the artist during a particularly rough period in his life. [it's like saying ""maybe richard and linda thompson shouldn't have recorded that album while their relationship disintegrated around them.""]  yes, the pace is slower, the tone is darker, but uninspired?  hardly.","Classic Country,Contemporary Folk,Country,Pop,Traditional Folk,Today's Country,Traditional Blues,Blues,Folk",shall add voice mr weldings id thought tribute recording pleased come across see original first two particularly inspiring especially familiar lovely genius various recordings steamboat gwine round de bend thought relax enjoy instead demanding something else however neednt developed forgiving attitude since rest recording well worth abiding interest certainly passages serious syncopation folks wide variety sounds styles recently hearing mr faheys collection yes jesus loves several times enjoyed faheys deconstruction straightforward time signatures doubt hymns feature elongated measures christ east west presented brings concept several pieces get kick knowi shall add voice mr weldings id thought tribute recording pleased come come across see original particularly inspiring especially familiar lovely genius recordings steamboat round bend thought relax enjoy instead demanding developed forgiving attitude rest recording worth abiding interest certainly passages syncopation folks wide variety sounds styles recently hearing mr faheys collection loves times enjoyed faheys deconstruction straightforward time time signatures signatures doubt hymns feature elongated measures east east west presented brings concept pieces kick
119,284,B0000003PW,"There ain't nothing like Texas blues.  The song goes that if you want to play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band.  That's not true.  If you want to  play in Texas, you have to play music that people can dance to.  Cowboys, oil workers, Latinos or black folks, people in Texas like to dance and they expect performers to play good music that they can dance to.Louisiana born grammy winner Johnny Clyde Copeland learned this while growing up in Houston, and like many other Texas bluesmen (Mr. Collins, T-Bone, SRV) his music has this influence.  In the old videos of his performances people in the crowd can be seen tapping their toes, swaying to the music, clapping hands or outright dancing.And like so many blues guitarists, he got better and better as he grew older and matured.  This CD is a pretty good representation of Copeland's later work, when he was at his best.  There is a lot of foot tapping music and plenty of good guitar work and solos from the talented guitar player Copeland.

Blessed with one of the more evocative voices in Country Music today, hers is a voice that sings of the simpler things in life and makes us realize  that these are the things that matter the most.

121,287,B0000003TG,"Iris DeMent's &quot;Infamous Angel&quot; softens her Dixie Chicks-like twang with sentimental, yet non-apologetic, skill.  With lyrics originating somewhere between heart, mind and soul, she composes confident ballads such as &quot;Let the Mystery Be,&quot;-- she doesn't dawdle with the question of God's existence.  Instead, she is comparable to Colette,the French novelist, whose wanderings led her to her personal interpretations of life's meanings.  Like Colette, DeMent believes in lusty romance, as evidenced in &quot;Hotter Than Mojave in My Heart.&quot;  Gospel rhythms predominate &quot;Higher Ground,&quot; and family bonds are themes in the title track and in &quot;Mama's Opry,&quot; in which EmmyLou Harris shares poignant vocals.  &quot;After You've Gone&quot; is a tribute to someone now departed, which cleverly follows &quot;Sweet Forgiveness,&quot;  a haunting song in both melody and lyrics. This is an album that will appeal to listeners who like the adventure of seeking, accepting and returning to one's roots.  &quot;Infamous Angel&quot; as a complete work symbolizes the country balladeer who finds truth lies right back at home. Frankly, and I admit this publicly for the first time in this space, I love Ms. Iris Dement. Not personally, of course, but through her voice, her lyrics and her musical presence. This `confession' may seem rather startling coming from a reviewer who is as likely in this space to go on and on about Bolsheviks, `Che', Leon Trotsky, high communist theory and the like.  And that is especially so given Ms. Dement's seemingly simple quasi- religious themes and commitment to paying homage to her rural background in song. All such discrepancies though go out the window here. Why?Well, for one, this old radical got a lump in his throat the first time he heard ""These Hills"". Okay, that happens sometimes-once- but why did he have the same reaction on the fifth and twelfth hearings? Explain that. I can easily enough. If, on the very, very remotest chance, there is a heaven then I know one of the choir members. Enough said. By the way give a listen to ""Sweet Forgiveness"" and ""After You've Gone"" (with that great line about knowing every line in her lover's face). Then you too will be in love with Ms. Iris Dement. Iris, here is my proposal. If you get tired of fishing the U.P., or wherever, with Mr. Greg Brown or get bored with his endless twaddle about old Iowa farms or the contents of Granma's root cellar just whistle. Better yet just yodel like you did when I first heard you on that ""Jimmie Rodgers Going Home"" song on the ""Driftless"" CD. Iris Dement has an interesting voice but to me the twang seems a bit exaggerated, almost a caricature of an Appalachian accent.  It probably passes well enough in the places where she holds concerts and they don't know any better.But what turned me off the most is her harsh criticism of Christianity and clearly hard left politics.  If you are a Christian and enjoy listening to someone scoffing at your beliefs then this might be your music.  If you are a communist or socialist then this is definitely your music - songs that Trotsky would love.I'm disappointed really.  I wanted to like Iris Dement after listening to Our Town but I just couldn't stomach all the progressive drivel in her music. Was a Christmas present and receiver loved it! There was one song the recipient was after - &#34;0ur Town&#34;, but thoroughly enjoys the entire album and is trying to get everyone to listen to it. Every time I listen to this album (and I've been listening for 8 years now) I am astounded by the way Iris writes.  In the crowd I hang out with, Iris DeMent is grouped with Elvis, Aretha, Emmylou, and Hank- you don't have to say the last name, everyone just knows them and acknowledges that they're among the greatest preformers ever.  I would tell you which songs on this album are among the best ever written, but every song Iris writes is among the best ever written.  No gathering of our friends would be complete without a song by Iris, and no music collection would be complete without Infamous Angel. MY HUSBAND HAS OTHER TAPES BY IRIS DEMENT ALSO PURCHASED ON AMAZON.COM, HE LOVES THIS TYPE OF MUSIC AND WHEN HE IS SEARCHING FOR JUST THE RIGHT PLACE TO GO TO BUY, HE COMES TO AMAZON.COM, THE PRODUCTS ARE ALWAYS JUST WHAT HE WANTED, THANKS AMAZON! Iris  DeMent will alway's be Rose Gentry (Pretty Saro/ Song Catcher) which drew my interest into her CDs She has a clear pleasant voice and writes many of her own song's which I enjoy, her mother (Higher Ground) is just great. I have four of her CDs and plan on collecting all.  Her songs are very HONEST. Them that know don't need to be told, the rest can go to YouTube and decide if Iris is to their taste. Personally I love this CD. Infamous Angel is another powerful body of work by a very talented artist.Dement uses her head to speak from her heart.  She sings about her life, the peculiarities of relationships, daily life. Her voice is defiant, joyful and plaintive, never very far from her Appalachian roots.  I saw her in concert about 18 years ago, and have been hooked ever since. When I first got this CD about a decade ago I treated it as a bit of a guilty pleasure.  A short time later, Iris Dement performed in a church in Berkeley, and I came up ticketless when the show sold out within 24 hours.  Then I understood the universal appeal of Iris Dement.  She has a simply unique voice, absolutely without artifice, that's somewhat reminiscent of the high lonesome sound of Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Hank Williams, or Kitty Wells. She's a wonderful songwriter whose songs speak of the human condition: love, death, redemption, foregiveness, family. ""Let the Mystery Be"" has sweet lyrics and an infectious melody, but the subject is no less serious than the meaning of life itself.  ""Our Town"", a nostalgic glimpse of the past, acknowledges that ""nothing good ever lasts"".  ""After You're Gone"", which she wrote when her father was very ill, can move anyone to tears who has lost a loved one.  The title track, ""Infamous Angel"", deals with home; where you're always welcome to return, even if you have strayed.  I've listened to this CD hundreds of times in the past 10 years and still love it.  No longer a guilty pleasure, I recommend Iris Dement to everyone. I have to admit up-front to being a devoted Iris DeMent fan. I first saw  her at the now defunct Folkways Coffee House in Peterborough, New Hampshire  in the early 1990s, and she performed most of the songs in this album. From  the opening number of ""Let The Mystery Be"", with Iris advising us that  she's happy not to wonder or worry about what God""s plan for her is, one  almost immediately recognizes the wondrous gift He has given us with Iris  DeMent. This album is an evocative, ethereal, and memorable excursion into  the existential dilemmas of contemporary life, and is a treasure for anyone  who loves the unique of country and folk music that Iris DeMent bridges so  artfully. All of her music here is original and special, and over the last  decade she has matured from her beginnings to become a most singular and  precious folk treasure. Here she mixes her deep natural religiosity with an  awesome practicality in her verses, as in the opening cut &quot;Let The  Mystery Be"" to ""These Hills"", in which she waxes sentimentally about her  love for the hill country she calls home. From ""Sweet Forgiveness"", a  touching ballad, to the title cut of ""Infamous Angel"", Iris manages to  wring honest, beautiful and special qualities from each of her  compositions. Indeed, this whole song cycle is terrific, and I only hope  she continues to produce such special and original music for all of us who  love her music and her sweet gentle vision of a life well lived and well  loved. Enjoy Iris is an Icon of country music.  Her voice is powerful.  Her lyrics tormented and true.  This is country.  Not cross over.  Not want to be rock.  Country.  No sense evaluating each and every song, since they all are forceful reminders of what country meant at one time.  A good purchase for any collection. Absolutely wonderful collection of folk/country music - sung by one of the masters of the genre.  A good representation of some of her best pieces. ....iris dement has such an unusual voice which keeps me listening from beginning to end...many others have been very expressive of her material, and all good replies.... Her crystal clear voice with lyrics that are spiritual in nature combine to create a great CD. It's old time country music.  It's one of my favorites... anyone who wants to hear music country music with just an edge of  gospel will love this cd pure voice and the instruments are amazing Love this CD!  It's got some of her best songs on it.  Her voice is so strong and rich and she tells true stories in her music. I've owned a copy of this album for years. I just needed to replace my old copy. I love it. This is definitely an album that any country music lover should have in their collection.  Be prepared, however, for something a bit unusual.  There is a raw honesty to the way that Iris DeMent sings that's a million  miles away from Nashville. But it's that lack of polish - and the subject  matter of hometown life and family - that gives it all so much charm.The songs are great - particularly the title track, as well as &quot;Let  the Mystery Be&quot; and &quot;Hotter than Mojave&quot;.I've seen Iris  in concert in the UK and her vocal performance live is just as good as on  CD.  She tends to be a little shy and retiring on stage though.I agree  with one or two of the other reviewers that subsequent albums haven't been  quite as hot. Don't let that put you off this one though. iris dement is one of those sparkly diamonds who sits at the side for no explainable reason of those who keep the candle of plain americana glowing. you might, along with millions of others, know her name as well as emmylou harris, but you don't.  other singers and songwriters do  --  one of those backstage tests of quality that outweigh commercial success.  plus, she has a distinctly pleasant voice and style.  so content yourself with the kind of music you're glad someone invited you in to hear in the living room or on the back porch.  this is her first of many studio collections, timeless and infectious, and one of the titles, &#34;let the mystery be,&#34; probably sums it up.as an aside, her works are available in the full cd-autorip-cloud-mp3 array that amazon has put up that makes life easier for this codger with a one-speed keyboard and first-gear thumbs. Terrific CD- not as good as My Life but close. Our Town and Let the Mystery Be are two of her best songs. And I like that she ended a gospel hymn sung by her mother. This is a great album...wonderful band, great singer, authentic songs ...very 'real' music. We will look for her music again. If you are looking for honest, unpretensious writing look no further. You  won't find any Ooh! Ooh Baby! fluff or any faux- romantic gimmicks in this  work. I consider myself a pretty tough guy but I get a lump in my throat  everytime I listen. I'm more of a classical music listener, but this voice and these songs let me enjoy American folk music without any apologies.  This is an excellent album performed by an angel, as far as I can tell.  You can't go wrong with any of these selections.  Loved it. I've recently purchased this  C.D. and I think it's great.Iris' voice is so  sweet and carefree on songs such as Infamous Angel and Hotter Than Mojave that you can't help but sing along.And on songs like Mamas Opry and Our Town it will almost bring a tear to your eye.I listen to it all of the time.I never get tired of it.I highly recommend this C. D. While Truth and Beauty needn't co-occur, when they do, the result is exhilirating. So, then, Iris DeMent's memorial pieces arouse one's tenderest rural American feelings, pivot them on the sacrifice of rural America to Free Trade (cf. ""Our Town""), and finally fuse them into righteous, Christian outrage at the cynical Republican profiteers (Bush/Cheney in ""Wasteland of the Free"").  Admittedly, I allude to songs beyond ""Infamous Angel.""  But, till an anthology appears, you can't have it all in one place. i just stumbled on to this album and it was love at first. real folk music of the highest caliber can't believe its been around for fifteen years and i never heard any of it miss DeMent writes and sings the  stuff and almost every tracks excellent i love all types of music as long as their tastefully done and this definitely fits the criteria The songs on this CD are very enjoyable to listen to.  The clarity of DeMent's voice is remarkable and the music is very good.  Many of the songs are nostaligic and cause my eyes to tear-up as I listen to them.  Listeners should concentrate on the words and music as the CD plays to fully appreciate the quality and messages of the songs. No doubt Iris Dement has an interesting sound.  And no doubt she can tell a story in song that can keep your interest.  However, I don't need to be preached to on every track.  Seems as though every song is about death and/or dying and/or going to a better place.  After awhile, enough is enough, and you just want to hear something that isn't inspirational.  But it never comes.  And the last track, Higher Ground, is more of an homage to her late mother, with Iris lost in the ""choir"".  I wish she hadn't bothered.  Iris has a better voice than her mother.While I would listen to the CD again, I would have to be in a special mood.  Sometimes it hurts to be hit over the head with the same ideas over and over again. Our Town, Momma's Opery and Higher Ground, sung by her mother, are awsome songs. Iris has an unforgetable voice that is so different it will bring a smile to your face. This is a voice that is unpolished and refreshing. Like many Listeners, I heard Iris Dement the first time when ""Our Town"" was played during the Series Finale of ""Northern Exposure"" and loved the song. Her simple, folky lyrics and warm sentiments reflect her upbringing in the Great Plains  and the song resonates with an innocence that is refreshing. But there is also more excellent material on ""Infamous Angel,"" with ""These Hills,"" being my favorite of her songs. The sincerity of this song evokes a black and white photograph of a longing memory and the final verse can move you to tears. Since I lived in the hills of Eastern Oklahoma for a time, where Iris was inspired to write this song, makes it all the more special to me. ""Sweet Forgiveness"" follows the same pattern . Not a bad song on the CD. When I first got this CD about a decade ago I treated it as a bit of a guilty pleasure. A short time later, Iris Dement performed in a church in Berkeley, and I came up ticketless when the show sold out within 24 hours. Then I understood the universal appeal of Iris Dement. She has a simply unique voice, absolutely without artifice, that's somewhat reminiscent of the high lonesome sound of Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Hank Williams, or Kitty Wells. She's a wonderful songwriter whose songs speak of the human condition: love, death, redemption, foregiveness, family. ""Let the Mystery Be"" has sweet lyrics and an infectious melody, but the subject is no less serious than the meaning of life itself. ""Our Town"", a nostalgic glimpse of the past, acknowledges that ""nothing good ever lasts"". ""After You're Gone"", which she wrote when her father was very ill, can move anyone to tears who has lost a loved one. The title track, ""Infamous Angel"", deals with home; where you're always welcome to return, even if you have strayed. I've listened to this CD hundreds of times in the past 10 years and still love it. No longer a guilty pleasure, I recommend Iris Dement to everyone. I was so happy to see this classic album come out on vinyl.  Iris does a trememdous job with lyrics and phrasingin her unique way.  Having her mom join for a track was a creative idea. Had the great pleasure of hearing Iris Dement live last nite in a concert in a small club here in Bloomington, IN. Her sweet twangy voice coupled with her honest (joltingly at times) lyrics, her calm, and at times very funny stage presence, made for one great evening. If you get the chance to see her perform live near you, get there, now. You won't regret it. Opening for her was Jason Wilbur, a lead guitarist for John Prine, and a talented singer/musician in his own right. A truly magical evening. This CD is wonderful for many reasons, all stated here by others quite succinctly. You spend more then this every week at Starbucks-buy this CD and learn for yourself why her reviews are all so good. Iris DeMent is a wonderful and refreshing folk singer. Her song &#34;Our Town&#34; is absolutely an emotional wonder. I really enjoyed this album. I heard it at a friend's house and immediately thought I would like to own a copy. Iris Dement has a distinct and unusual vocal style and the whole album is very mellow and enjoyable. Here is one  Rare  Treasure...........a very special performer, and songwriter ... Refreshing beyond description ...............She reaches right into your soul .......... both in personal performances and carried right into her recorded music !!! There are not enough stars to award Iris DeMent's work. The other Amazon reviews will testify to this. Her's is the truest and most lovely American voice extant. Lovely. Buy everything by her available.I wish she'd do ""The Last Thing on My Mind,"" ""Funny How Time Slips Away,"" ""Today I Started Loving You Again,""  as well as any number of traditional gospel songs. This music reminds me of all the generations of women and girls in the big kitchen at the dairy farm where I worked summers as a kid. They'd all be in there with fans running and steam coming out of huge pans boiling noodles and potatoes and greens, pans frying chicken and pork chops, cutting up stuff out of the garden, getting ready for the big dinner, which, of course, is  the noon meal. We'd come in all sweaty and ""worsh up"" before everybody'd sit down for a prayer and this enormous meal that, at that time and place with all the folks together, was the only kind of affluence and conspicuous consumption that mattered and that anybody needed. Iris sings it. as I listen to this music, I can almost picture Iris on the porch of an old shack in the south with barefeet, an old skirt and snuggled up to her guitar, oblivious to the world around her. i love this artist. have not had any of her stuff before but have listened to her on radio. love iris Iris DeMent has put together a sparkling treasure chest of songs that evoke times and places and best sentiments of mountain community. Imagine Carol King, Joni Mitchell and Carley Simon without the annoying added  layers studio glitz that spoil their vocals and bury their lyric message.  Every time you play this deceptively subtle CD you get something more out  of it. We pass our days with things to do and places to go - this is our lot in life. This is life. But now and then you make a 'wrong&quot; turn on a street and pass a shop from which you barely hear something that seems  familiar and are drawn towards its source. You walk into the middle of  &quot;Let The Mystery Be&quot; as Iris' CD is playing from speakers on the  wall. It is not a record shop, but a poutpourri little store. &quot;Who is  that singing,&quot; you ask the lady with the beautiful long silver hair  behind the counter. &quot;Thats Iris Dement,&quot; she says. I say, &quot;I  never heard of her,&quot;. The lady says, &quot;Then today is your lucky  day&quot;. She points to a chair by the counter and says, &quot;Have a seat  and listen to this; you are about to take a journey.&quot; I do as she says  while she turns to the cd player and forwards to &quot;Our Town&quot;.The song finishes and the lady with the long beautiful silver hair looks  at my expression and says, &quot;You don't have to say a word -  you have  just become DeMented,&quot; she says with a smile as she writes down Iris'  name and the title of the CD &quot;Infamous Angel&quot; on a notepad and  hands me the slip of paper. She says, &quot;I think most music stores carry  her cds.&quot; You don't sell cds at all,&quot; I ask in disappointment.  &quot;Sorry, but no, I don't. If I stocked this one, though, I'd probably  be out of stock most of the time, anyway.&quot; I buy some candles out of  politeness, thank her for allowing me to listen to the music and race to a  place and within less than an hour I own &quot;Infamous Angel&quot;. Now,  were it a tape or a record, it would have long since lost its essense from  repititous play, but Iris Dement's songs are what cd technology were  designed for - you can not stop yourself from overplaying this album, nor  would you want to!  Iris DeMent's songs and voice fill longings I didn't  even know existed in my heart! Should you buy this CD?..Good God yes!  and  don't even bother looking at the sticker price..and then share it with  anyone you can! what trad  country sound should be.  Have not tended to listen to what I thought was a play-out genre, But had a nostalgic ride into the retro sound only Iris could produce. After hearing her on NPR and a movie sound track was a little disappointed in these songs, Iris's voice was find I just din't conect with these tunes, I belive her mother sings on the last song. We became familiar with Iris DeMent after hearing her perform on &#34;A Prairie HOme Companion.&#34;  We bought her newest album, &#34;Sing the Delta&#34; and loved it.  This album is equally good and easy to listen to.  Her voice is unique, her piano playing excellent, and the songs tell wonderful stories.  We love it! Infamous Angel will take your heart, mind and soul on a journey that you will want to repeat over and over again.Family, love, faith are so colorfully lyriced, with melodies, that allow you to drift off into a land  of reality, that you did not know existed.  Once you make this visit, you  want to return over and over again.I have purchased 3 copies of this CD  in the last 8 years. Actually wore out one copy.  The others I lent out and  I can not take the copy away from a friend.  So, I just order a few  more.Order two copies, one for you and one that you can lent to a  friend!A must CD for anyone that is serious about what real music is all  about! Iris Dement is one of the best voices I have ever listened too, so glad I have Amazon to be able to find things that you wouldn't find just anywhere, great condition  when received, excellent quality. FABULOUS LYRICS, MELODIES AND VOCALS. LOVE IT!  THE LYRICS ARE STORIES OF HER LIFE EX;PERIENCE AND REALLY INTERESTING.  NEED I SAY ANYMORE? I've had the cassette for ages but could not find it after a move.  It has a few of my DeMent favorites that just mellow me out when I hear them.  Just what I needed. I had all my Iris DeMent music on tape and when I ordered it on CD I got automatic MP3 downloads to my computer and Kindle. Love it! Iris Dement is a song writer of the quality of John Denver, butwrites credibly about a wider range of subjects including life, love, family, growing older, and the most innocent song about the joys of sex you'll ever hear. Her melodies and poems are catchy, singable and never filled with self-pity or hatred.Those who like drum machine rhythms and screaming will be turned off, but lots of others will become addicted. Never heard of Iris till she did the John Prine special on PBS. Her voice was like a songbird from heaven when he called her up to sing. Pure, clear honest voice. Then I bought this album and was floored. Not only is she a fine singer, she is a dynamite songwriter. You can tell that she has worked on her craft of writing, wordsmithing. She touches us all. Her voice carries us to different places. In a nutshell --she is John Prine in Maybelle Carter clothes. THis young lady is great.  A wonderfully refreshing voice, and a story to tell.  She is a breath of fresh air. Iris' voice does not have the polish of Alison Krauss but while Alison will gather national awards (which she deserves), Iris will sing to you in your living room.  Lovely and down to earth. Iris DeMent has one of the most beautiful country voices I've ever heard.  The songs on this CD are sweet, simple and sound like they could have been written fifty years ago.I bought this CD after hearing &quot;Our Town&quot; played as the final song on the television series Northern Exposure.  If you enjoyed that series you will love this CD.  It will make you feel like you're sitting in the Brick with Maggie, listening to Chris on KBHR, waiting for Holling to bring you a beer. Iris DeMent's songs are pure, personal reflections of her humble upbringings presented in an easy listening style with some of the best string music backups I've heard, especially the Dobro (including Jerry Douglas on ""Infamous Angel"")! Her voice is unique, like Dolly, Burl Ives, Rod Stewart, etc., being distinctive and easily recognized. As John Prine attests: ""Iris has a voice I like a whole lot, like one you've heard before-but not really.""The last song on this album is sung by Iris' mother, Flora Mae DeMent, as a salute to her musical inspiration to her children.  I love it! I first heard &quot;our town&quot; at the end of an episode of Northern Exposure and couldn't figure out who was singing or title of the song. I searched for months and finally thought of the net.....long story short I  discovered Iris Dement, what a great CD, I just love Our Town, she sings  how I wish to remember my town in N.Dak...... First heard &#34;My town&#34; during the last show of &#34;Northern Exposure.&#34;  Have enjoyed this recording.  Wish she would come to the Phoenix area so I could see and hear her in person.  No suck luck, yet.  I enjoy this CD very much. Iris Dement has a wonderful voice, but on this CD she does a lot of songs that don't suit her voice at all.  Our Town is a great song, as are a few of the others, but overall if I'd heard the CD before buying it I probably wouldn't have. For those unfamiliar with Iris DeMent, she is a traditional country singer with the kind of twangy voice you either love or hate, but very distinctive.Iris sings about the things country singers are expected to sing about - the family, relationships, the countryside and religion. She has her own unique style and sound, but at times she reminds me of a young Dolly Parton.When country albums are released in the UK, they usually go out of print after a couple of years at the most. This one is still in print (at full price) in both the UK and the USA more than ten years after initial release, proving that there is still a steady demand for this high-quality album.If you like traditional country at it's best, with no compromises to commercialism, this is for you. You won't find a better traditional country album. I first heard Iris DeMent on British television on the ""Transatlantic Sessions"" and was overwhelmed by the unaffected lyrical beauty of her performance.  Emmylou Harris was also featured on those sessions and she joins Iris on a track of this CD.  All three of Iris's solo albums are worth having but this, her first, is undoubtedly her best.  If you like Joni Mitchell, Buffy Sainte-Marie and other female singer/songwriters in the folk/country/protest tradition, then you really must hear Iris DeMent, for she is the greatest of them all.  The first track on this album, ""Let the Mystery Be"", deserves classic status and the CD is worth buying just for that song.  I could have done without the final track, which is Iris's mother in a performance that I would have thought only a daughter could enjoy (although I note some other reviewers liked it).  Still, that leaves 10 tracks of great songs from this unique and very special voice. Fell in love with her music, lyrics and that great vocalization years ago. I lent INFAMOUS ANGEL out sometime ago and it was passed around and never returned so just had to have my own CD. Still lose myself in her music!! Like many Iris Dement fans, I first heard her on the final episode of Northern Exposure.  &quot;Our Town&quot; - What a great song.  What a great singer.  Ms. Dement has a lot of soul, and it comes forward in almost every song.  I was touched by her inclusion of her mother's recording &quot;Mother's Opry&quot; even though it was a little off-key.  Iris Dement is truly an angel with a talent rooted in a deep spiritual understanding. She may consider herself primarily a songwriter, but Iris' caught-out-of-time vocals are the central attraction here.  Both in delivery and accent, she recreates a lost era in country music, before the rock-n-roll influence.  No drums here.  If you're looking for a ""sounds like..."" comparison, the best I can do is Nanci Griffith or Loretta Lynn: uniquely and endearingly twangy.The songs themselves are a mixed bag.  Three or four are memorable, which is about what a decent album shoots for.  Her signature rural decay song ""Our Town"" is here.  The opener ""Let The Mystery Be"" declares her agnosticism toward religion, but most of the other songs drip with southern Baptist values, most notably the closer ""Higher Ground"" on which Iris yields lead vocals to her mother.  Overall, this is the sort of album that helps to complete any well-rounded music collection. This a great record and remains, IMHO, her best, as is the case for most musicians, I find. This one is highly recommended. ""INFAMOUS ANGEL"" is an album unlike most others you have unless you are a fan of blue grass, folk music, or old style country music. This is not a bad thing. I like ""INFAMOUS ANGEL"". It is very different from that to which I usually listen. It is a great change of pace and very enjoyable. I find that excellance of all kinds can be appreciated by anyone no matter what their tastes. ""INFAMOUS ANGEL"" falls into this category. It is excellant.The song that makes ""INFAMOUS ANGEL"" famous is ""OUR TOWN"" which was featured in the series finallee of the tv show ""NORTHERN EXPOSURE"". The album is worth the price just to get this one song. All the others are a bonus. Iris Dement's first LP (CD) is like .....when I was a boy, a young teenager, I sat in the back seat of a dirty white Dodge station wagon with an older step -sister that I hardly knew + an arguing my mother and a step-father drinking driving while we traveled 500+ miles from CA to OR to see his ex-wife and my mother's best friend.Iris sings like that. This album was recorded quite a while ago, but for some reason I just found it.  It's very good.It's a treat to hear Emmy Lou Harris do backup for Iris Dement in Mama's Opry, which is a sentimental song about Iris' mother.  The REAL professionals, like Emmy Lou Harris, don't have to show off -- they know how to showcase the lead singer.  And then in the next song Iris Dement sings backup for mom herself in a similarly professional manner.  Her mom is not the same caliber singer, of course, but she is sincere and the whole thing is both heartwarming and ... truly professional. Simply the best... what a voice and the instrumentation is wonderful.  More of her in my future and that's for sure Every so often I hear a CD that makes me sit back in awe - and listening to 'Infamous Angel' was one of those occasions. Iris Dement has a voice that is so Country but so unlike the usual and  her songwriting is brilliantly simple but astute. Her music is a mix of folk, bluegrass, gospel & honkytonk and here she's backed by a top band that includes Emmylou Harris, Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, Al Perkins, Roy Huskey Jr. & Jim Rooney. Standout tracks: 'Let The Mystery Be', 'These Hills', 'Hotter Than Mojave..', 'Our Town', 'Mama's Opry', and the wonderful title track.Iris Dement's 'Infamous Angel' is Essential Country. I purchased this for my wife, who quite enjoys it.  Her favorite is the first song Let The Mystery Be.  Mine is Our Town, which I first heard at the end of the last episode of Northern Exposure.  You can find a couple of Iris DeMent's performances of the song on the internet, and the Northern Exposure scene. If you love the religious and blue grass tones, you will love this CD.  Iris DeMent gives a wonderful, melodic walk through life's experiences.  I loved this CD so much, which was recommended by a family member, I listened to nothing else for days~enjoy! I can't believe it took so long for me to discover Iris Dement. I heard her over the credits of True Grit by the Coen brothers. I ordered three of her four CDs and in my opinion this is the best! If you enjoy slower songs with an old-time country feel then this CD is for you. A wonderful singer.  Beautiful voice and meaningful thoughts.  Iris has been around for years, and I only heard of her recently. This is one of those albums you will most likely want to play over and over again.  My favorite on it is ""OUR TOWN"", which is so beautiful as well as a bit humorous at the same time.  It is a very mellow album and the poetry is amazing.  After I got this album, I decided I would like to hear more of Iris Dement.  She will become a legend of true country music.  If you like Nanci Griffith and Emmy Lou Harris, you will very likely like Iris Dement. Iris Dement has an unusual voice that is easy to listen to.  This CD was used, but flawless.  The songs are original and catchy.  Her mother even sings a song, but I'm not sure she needed to be on there.  I would have liked the CD better without her. I first heard this lady while driving through the high desert in the Four Corners ... our driver put this cassette in and asked me if I'd ever heard of Iris Dement.  When I said that I hadn't, he smiled a sort of Cheshire  Cat grin and turned up the volume. Some how I was whisked back to the  little town where I grew up, where there were church socials on most  weekends, folk music was still pretty popular, and &quot;country  music&quot; was nothing like what's now called &quot;Country and  Western&quot;.  As we drove through the mountains my eyes filled up time  and time agin, each time threatening to spill tears down my face, spoiling  my carefully cultivated macho image.  With the first song (&quot;Let the  Mystery Be&quot;) I was a goner.  Her songs reminded me of how much I used  to love listening to John Prine, and all the other folks who play  that  old-time undoctored music.  She also appears in several cuts of John  Prine's &quot;In Spite of Ourselves&quot; CD, and the sound of the two of  them in duet makes me love her music even more. I, too, first heard Iris DeMent on public radio.  The effect was such that I had to buy one of her albums, so I started with the first.  How wonderful!  However, the following two albums just don't do it for me and  I'm not quite sure why; perhaps because the first one is more  &quot;countrified&quot;?  Nevertheless, Infamous Angel should be purchased  and enjoyed by all. Infamous Angel is one of her best.  Let the Mystery Be is one of my most favorite songs Iris Dement has ever recorded.  My husband's favorite is Our Town. This is simply magnificent.  If you don't get this, you need to check yourself.  What a voice, what a vision... what a CD.  It's real country music, but then again, maybe it's not.  It's just great music that sounds like old country, but then again like nothing you've heard before.  It's brain-visual, if you know what I mean.  I'm the Big O and I gotta go. I discovered Iris Dement's first recording much as I did John Prine's over 30 years ago, while spending a Saturday afternoon in a music store. And, like Prine's first album, Dement's Infamous Angel seems almost beyond criticism.Her melodies and her voice seem so utterly timeless, carved and whittled from the stone and the forests of the deep South. Her lyrics cut to the bone, with  images and motifs that are both achingly sincere and incandescently universal. To choose one song from this set is, again, like choosing one song from Prine's first--almost impossible. And yet ""Our Town"" speaks to me in a way that only a handful of songs, a handful of poems, a handful of novels have done in my 60 years. Every image is utterly recognizable, sometimes joyfylly so, sometimes devastatingly so.It is her town. It is her life. And yet we know that life. We know the spinning of the years. The moments of rich possibility, the moments of final passing. We know the eternal truth of the sun sinking down in our homes, in our lives, in our town.Iris Dement is truly an American treasure. There is nothing airbrushed or new-Nashville about her or her music. She is joltingly real. Her music stuns and shapes the heart. Iris Dement IS the heart. Why not a bit of hyperbole?  This lady deserves it as much as anybody else!  And in our demented, depraved, Brittany dominated trash heap of a culture, I'm for just about any non-violent tactic available to get people to wake up and rediscover something they may have forgotten, called life.iris dement has a funny voice for the plastic america in which it finds itself.  it's got twang and lilt and other visitations from another planet, and it hasn't been sterilized of its humanity.  it seems to sing only songs which seem to resound with truth, with authenticity.is this voice a gift from a simpler age?  a visitation from a higher power?  how did it get past the conformity police of our dark age?perhaps it's best not to ask questions.  just to raise thanks for the restorative power of what we've been given. I bought this CD for the song &quot;Our Town.&quot;  While I love that song, and I also like &quot;Let the Mystery Be&quot;, this CD reminds me of the type of singing they used to do on HeeHaw.  Warbly, twangy and overly sentimental.  Not my cup of tea at all. A fabulous album about love, life, roots and changing relationships.  Regular stuff, I guess, but delivered in a fresh, unique manner.  Reminiscent of early Nanci Griffith so let's hope she doesn't spoil her  career by doing too many albums, too often.","Classic Country,Contemporary Folk,Americana,Country,Pop,Traditional Folk,Neotraditional,Outlaw Country,Singer-Songwriters,Folk",iris dements quot infamous angel quot softens dixie chicks like twang sentimental yet non apologetic skill lyrics originating somewhere heart mind soul composes confident ballads quot let mystery quot doesnt dawdle question gods existence instead comparable colette french novelist whose wanderings led personal interpretations lifes meanings like colette dement believes lusty romance evidenced quot hotter mojave heart quot gospel rhythms predominate quot higher ground quot family bonds themes title quot mamas opry quot emmylou harris shares poignant vocals quot youve gone quot tribute someone departed cleverly follows quot sweet forgiveness quot haunting melody lyrics appeal listeners like adventure seeking accepting returning ones roots quot infamous iris iris dements dements quot infamous infamous angel angel quot softens dixie chicks chicks twang sentimental apologetic skill lyrics originating heart mind soul composes confident ballads let mystery quot dawdle question gods existence instead comparable colette french novelist led personal interpretations lifes meanings colette dement believes lusty romance evidenced quot heart quot gospel rhythms predominate quot higher ground quot family family bonds bonds themes title quot mamas quot emmylou harris shares poignant vocals tribute departed cleverly follows quot sweet sweet forgiveness forgiveness quot haunting haunting melody melody lyrics appeal listeners adventure seeking accepting returning ones roots infamous

I drove to the nearest CD emporium and  was shortly home listenung to the entire album.  Got on the net and found I  could obtain three of her earlier works on CD from Canada.  Picked up  &quot;Lullaby Berceuse&quot;.  Subsequently saw her three consecutive  nights in Vancouver, B.C..  Unbelievable.  At the concert picked up her  fist album which was only available on cassette. I am not Connie, so, must  admit my words are not adequate to convey her magic. I was lucky enough to hear Connie Kaldor sing &quot;I Love That Dog&quot; on a Saturday morning Canadian radio station broadcast (short wave).  From that moment, I became a devoted fan, and not just because I love my dogs.  My husband purchased this CD for me for Christmas, and it is playing even as I write this review.  As a regular visitor to Edmonton, Alberta, I can't believe I've missed her music all this time.  I won't make that mistake again.

124,298,B0000003XL,"Chanting Dread was my first Big Youth album and is still my favorite. I can assure you that you've never heard anything like this before- Yout has the Best way of delivering a melody over the rhythms of the Arcangels Band.What is important is that Yout will make you feel like dancing, but he'll also deliver the Prophecy that speaks to your soul.  Listen to the Power in Yout's voice in 'Dread Inna Babylon'.Easily alternating between playful laughing and chanting roots, Yout is imaginative and inspiring.Expect this broaden your idea of what reggae music is, because it's coming from one of the Originals and it is by no means a Bob Marley album.  (That's okay isn't it?)Try 'Some Great Big youth' or 'dreadlocks dread' if you enjoy the style of this album, and the 'Live at Sunplash' if you prefer strict Prophecy.  PEACE. Big Youth is unique in the world of reggae. He is very spiritual and his vocals are as the title would suggest...chanting. Not in the sense that you'd expect to hear in Hindu or Gregorian chants, but in a spoken flow.

In particular I still listen to ""Red Hot"" an instrumental track that uses a melody and horn arrangement I've heard in other reggae music.  Simply a great theme.

127,304,B000000405,"I bought this LP some years back and has filled our home with its feel over and over again. A collection of singles we can never get tired of.Unlike her brother Alton, Hortense had a short singing career. Apparently, she married and, unfortunately to the music world, retired to the home life. On this CD we can enjoy her tone and cadence, which, for whoever that hasn't experienced it, should. Pure complete magic! This CD, to the best of my knowledge, was never a proper LP. Rather, it is a collection of singles. They are either duets or solo performances, from sometime in the mid to late-60's, the peak of the rock steady period (which  was basically Jamaican interpretations of the Detroit and Memphis R&amp;B  scenes).To the unacquainted: Alton, at this stage in his career, was  the Jamaican Marvin Gaye and on these performances espescially, the subtle  nuances (use of breath sounds, vibrato, etc.) of his voice are without  fault. He gives the impression that he can bend and shape a tone at will.  Now, on the other hand, Hortense displays an Astrud Gilberto-esque  innocence. It's as though she's singing, not as a professional but, as a  result of having actually lived the tribulations behind these love songs.Amazing productiuon and engineering. Tactful and subtle musicianship.  And other than the altered &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot; (a racy little tune  that, as the metaphors reveal themselves, makes one wonder how it actually  recieved airplay), none of the songs have been remixed or dubbed over.  These are classic rock steady performences that rival America's best and  most soulful moments. I've got over a thousand records and this ranks among  my favorites. If you've got friends that can't get past the (horribly  misinterpreted) hippie stigma of reggae, this is the record that will win  them over! Alton just died at the age of 74. I once told a friend, a big fan of Bob Marley but also Motown and American R&B;, that Alton Ellis is the greatest soul singer of all time. He was incredulous. But he hadn't ever heard him before.First of all, Sam Cooke died at 32 (I would give him second place), Otis Redding at 27, and Marvin Gaye in his early 30s. Smokey Robinson I would put in the running too.Alton not only had more years to improve his body of work than his short-lived American competition, he also, like Bob Marley, matured and wrote some of his greatest songs later in life.Unfortunately he never reached the international heights of recognition he deserved. Probably he is best known for Sean Paul's version of his ""I'm Still in Love with You"".Alton was no Rude Boy, slacker or dance hall poseur. Like Bob Marley, his songs consistently exalt human rights and dignity. His love songs though really excel.It is his HEART that sets him apart. FEELING. Along with Gregory Isaacs and Bob Marley, he is the greatest vocalist Jamaica has ever produced. That is saying a lot, because the little island of Jamaica has produced many great singers, most of whom remain very obscure. More than any other nation per capita by a factor of 100s.Alton has produced some great vinyl albums with songs that have never made it to CD. This is true of at least a half dozen other great reggae albums by other singers. Alton's Silver Jubilee albums for example have great versions and songs not on any CD. Also, there is no CD with his version - the greatest of all - of the banned song ""Fat Girl"".His sister Hortense arguably is the greatest female singer produced by Jamaica. Other contenders are Judy Mowatt and Phyllis Dillon. I would add The Lovejoys. She is understated and best when she sings Alton's songs, as well as a few other great Studio One songs found only on compendium albums and this one. I can't add much to the excellent review given by the prior writers (kudos  for that review- excellent!!! I'm glad there are other Ellis fans out  there), so I will only add what I can to help strengthen their  review.This collection was not a proper lp at any point, though it  should have been. The songs are first rate examples of Ellis' rocksteady  power. &quot;Willow Tree&quot; was a hit for him in late '66, and  &quot;People Make the World Go Round&quot; was also a minor hit;  so my  guess would be that these songs were recorded around the late summer to  fall of '66 (remember, technology was basic then- many lps were recorded  live in the studio, as overdubbing was not yet common, especially in  Jamaica- until King Tubby and Scratch got their paws on such  machinery).As for &quot;Breakfast In Bed,&quot; it is no worse than the  Heptones' banned clasic &quot;Fattie Fattie&quot; though the point is well  taken as to how it got radio play..who knows when it comes to  censorship?As always, Ellis showcases his soulful voice to great effect  on this collection, and his powers were rarely sharper. This lp, along with  any others that showcase his Studio One output (&quot;Sunday Coming,&quot;  &quot;Sings Rock and Soul&quot;) come very highly recommended. Delicious.","Alternative Rock,Reggae,Pop,Rocksteady,Ska,World Music,Caribbean & Cuba",bought lp years back filled home feel collection singles never get tired unlike brother alton hortense short singing career apparently married unfortunately world retired home life cd enjoy tone cadence whoever hasnt experienced pure complete magic cd best knowledge never proper lp rather collection singles either duets solo performances sometime mid late peak rock steady period basically jamaican interpretations detroit memphis r amp b scenes unacquainted alton stage career jamaican marvin gaye performances espescially subtle nuances use breath sounds vibrato etc voice without fault gives impression bend shape tone hand hortense bought lp years filled home feel collection singles tired brother short singing career apparently married unfortunately world retired home life cd enjoy tone cadence experienced pure complete magic cd best knowledge proper lp collection singles duets solo performances mid late peak rock rock steady steady period basically jamaican interpretations detroit amp scenes unacquainted alton stage career jamaican marvin gaye gaye performances subtle nuances breath breath sounds sounds vibrato voice fault impression bend shape tone hand
128,306,B000000422,"Very good album with good music I would have to say this is the perfect place to start if you are just starting to get into Alton Ellis or Rocksteady.  Ellis has one of the most expressive voices I've ever heard and it really comes out on these recordings.  I was going to list some of the highlights of this album, but I can't think of a song I wouldn't recommend.  Everything on this album, from the originals to the covers, is amazing. Not much to say except this is a gorgeously sweet, rhythmic album. Cream  in your coffee, water clear as gine. I can go for weeks playing it every  day. What a joy it is to see this album. I pulled it out last evening and gave  it the 100th or so once over and was still smiling ear to ear before,  during, and after, the listen.Ellis is the crooner par excellence in the  rocksteady game, and this collection proves it and then some. His  relationship with the legendary Duke Reid allowed Ellis carte blanche to do  what he did best-not only write brilliant original tunes, but also take  popular soul or R&amp;B tunes from the era and making them so much reggae  and his iwn that they superceded the term &quot;cover tune.&quot;And  what tunes this lp has. Many cover tunes grace this lp, and after a few  listens, one begins to appreciate Ellis' gift for making them his own. In  many cases, including on Chuck Jackson's &quot;Willow Tree,&quot; the  Delfonics' clasic &quot;La La Means I Love You,&quot; Junior Walker's  &quot;What Does It Take,&quot; and Blood Sweat and Tear's anthem &quot;You  Make Me So Very Happy,&quot; Ellis' renditions are so amazing that you  almost forget that he didn't pen those tunes.And the tunes he DID pen on  this compilation are no less amazing. &quot;Why Birds Follow Spring&quot;  is a gorgeous showcase for Ellis, as his voice fills the room, soaring over  the equally great backing vocals. Other great originals include the  understated &quot;If I Could Rule This World,&quot; &quot;Cry Tough,&quot;  Ellis' reply to the Rude Boy movement (led by the Wailers) that he so  disliked, &quot;Can't Stand It,&quot; which U-Roy would make a hit in the  late 70's, and Ellis' socially aware masterpiece, the touching &quot;Black  Man,White Man&quot; (also known as &quot;Black Man's Pride&quot;)This  compilation is a perfect look into the mind and inner workings of the Duke  Reid era Ellis, who's voice insipred the likes of Gregory Isaacs and Dennis  Brown, among many. The voice is amazing, as is the cd. A must have.","Alternative Rock,Reggae,Jamaica,Pop,Rocksteady,Ska,World Music,Caribbean & Cuba",good good would say perfect place start starting get alton ellis rocksteady ellis one expressive voices ive ever heard really comes recordings going list highlights cant think wouldnt recommend everything originals covers amazing much say except gorgeously sweet rhythmic cream coffee water clear gine go weeks playing every day joy see pulled last evening gave th still smiling ear ear listen ellis crooner par excellence rocksteady game collection proves relationship legendary duke reid allowed ellis carte blanche best write brilliant original tunes also take popular good good good good say perfect place start starting rocksteady expressive voices heard really comes recordings list highlights think recommend originals covers amazing say gorgeously sweet rhythmic cream coffee water clear weeks playing day joy see pulled smiling ear ear listen crooner par excellence rocksteady game collection proves relationship legendary duke duke reid reid allowed carte carte blanche blanche best write brilliant original tunes popular

130,309,B00000042W,"Great cd. If you are looking for a GOOD classic reggae music,this is the one. Every track in this cd is superb,you should add it to your archive. Clearly one of the best efforts by the Heptones. A WONDERFUL disk packed with some of the best classic reggae ever recorded. Notable tunes include Stick Man, I Shall Be Released and the beautiful Nine Pounds of Steel. A  must for Heptones fans or lovers of classic reggae. Just they don't make  em' like this anymore... Sweet stuff. Great CD - Is this the group that sang Sea of Love for the Movie,Sea of Love, with Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin?  I need to know. Thanks. More than any other vocal trio, the Heptones are the benchmark against  which all other vocal trios in Jamaica were, and still are, measured, and  their legenday sessions at Coxsone Dodd's Studio One are among the finest  examples of rocksteady that you will ever find.The trio, consisting of  lead vocalist/writer Leroy Sibbles, Barry Llewellyn, and Earl Morgan, came  into their own with the rise of the rocksteady movement in the mid 60's,  and with their move from the Caltone label (which released one of the most  unusual recordings of both the Heptones and all of Jamaican music, the  bizarre &quot;Gun Men Coming to Town,&quot; the trio's interpretation of  the &quot;William Tell Overture&quot;) to the famed Studio One, the band  hit their collective stride and never looked back.This cd is a treasure  trove for any fan of the Heptones for a few reasons:1). The music is top  rate- no fluff or filler on this cd. The collection beautifully showcases  Leroy Sibbles' delicate and pure tenor voice, as well as his gifted  songwriting talents.2). The choice of songs is great- the covers of the  pop chestnut &quot;Sea of Love,&quot; Curtis Mayfield's classic  &quot;Choice of Colors,&quot; Nina Simone's &quot;Young, Gifted, and  Black,&quot; Phil Spector's &quot;You've Lost That Loving Feeling,&quot;  and even Bob Dylan's &quot;I Shall Be Released,&quot; highlight the trio's  wonderful sense of harmonies and how that could take any tune and with  their signature style, make it their own. Not to be overlooked are the  original tunes, including &quot;Ting a Ling,&quot; and &quot;Love Me With  All of Your Heart,&quot; both of which are classics.3). Those voices.  Sibble's beautiful tenor is mostly showcased on the lp, but Llewellyn is  featured on &quot;Stick Man,&quot; and &quot;Nine Pounds of Steel.&quot;  Morgan is the harmony man par excellence. Put em together and you have melt  in your mouth vocal perfection.My only complaint is that the cd isn't a  double cd, which would allow many of the trio's other big hits, such as  &quot;Pretty Looks,&quot; &quot;I Hold the Handle,&quot; &quot;Equal  Rights,&quot; and &quot;Party Time,&quot; to be included. I also wish more  of Llewellyn's compositions could have been used- again I mention his  &quot;Pretty Looks.&quot;Despite those petty gripes, this collection is  beautifully done, showcasing rocksteady's foremost group. A group that  stands the test of time beautifully, the Heptones are to die for. Essential Heptones.Essential Rocksteady.This CD started my love affair with Rocksteady . . . the music of the gods.  If more people listened to reggae, there would be less war.","Reggae,World Music,Pop,Rocksteady",great cd looking good classic reggae one every cd superb add archive clearly one best efforts heptones wonderful disk packed best classic reggae ever recorded notable tunes include stick man shall released beautiful nine pounds steel must heptones fans lovers classic reggae dont make em like anymore sweet stuff great cd group sang sea love movie sea love al pacino ellen barkin need know thanks vocal trio heptones benchmark vocal trios jamaica still measured legenday sessions coxsone dodds studio one among finest examples rocksteady ever find trio consisting lead vocalist writer leroy sibbles barry llewellyn earl morgan came rise rocksteady movem great cd looking good classic reggae cd superb add archive clearly best best efforts efforts heptones wonderful disk disk packed packed best classic reggae recorded notable tunes include stick stick man man released beautiful pounds steel heptones fans lovers classic reggae dont em anymore sweet sweet stuff stuff great cd group sang sea love movie sea love al al pacino pacino ellen ellen barkin know thanks vocal trio heptones vocal trios jamaica measured sessions coxsone dodds studio studio one examples find trio lead lead vocalist vocalist writer leroy sibbles barry barry llewellyn earl came rise rocksteady
131,310,B00000042X,"Fun and relaxing music. Enjoy listening to it while driving. The only minus is that some if the songs sound like Rap which I don't care for. But otherwise very satisfying. The Melodians were a leading group during the rock steady era (about 1965-8), specializing in love songs delivered with sweet harmonies.  This compilation was put together with much love and care by Heartbeat Records' irreplacable Chris Wilson, who arranged for digital remastering from the original master tapes.  Those who used to collect the original Jamaican 45s will be pleased with the improved sound. The selection is A-1.  Definitely the Soul of Jamaica. This collection nicely encompasses most of the Melodians' best tracks,  allowing the trio to showcase nicelt their signature harmonies and vocal  stylings.For all the great tracks it offers, like &quot;Swing and  Dine,&quot; &quot;Little Nut Tree,&quot; and &quot;You Don't Need Me,&quot;  there are several crucial tracks missing from this compilation that would  make it the perfect compilation. Included in those missing are the great  tracks &quot;I Caught You,&quot; &quot;Sweet Sensation,&quot; and the rasta  based &quot;Rivers of Babylon.&quot;For what it is missing, what the cd  offers are first rate hits, and I agree with the other reviewer- it was  carefully put together, and the re-mastering on it was wonderfully done.

134,314,B000000459,"First off, don't even think of buying this album before owning the original, the Abyssinians are a vocal group, the songs are great, hear them in their entirety. The dub mixing on this album is not credited to anyone, this is not a vintage dub album, these are modern dubs of vintage songs. The mixing is boring, predictable, and formulaic.  Not creative at all, these mixes just leave you wanting the originals.  The vocals are never echoed off into the distance; they play for a few bars and then just stop.  Dub is not about turning instruments on and off; it is about weilding the instruments like swords, slicing through the sound and flowing through your head. A good dub will create new rhythms by using different combinations of the existing tracks to create something more than the sum of its parts.  This album is just the original album, lacking different instruments at different parts.  Completely predictable, the mixer of this album seems to just be following the 'rules of dub': play vocals for two bars, stop, play bass and drums for two bars, use reverb, stop, enter guitar for measure, stop, repeat.  Dissapointing. And &quot;declaration of dub&quot;'s only version of the great song &quot;declaration of rights&quot; is not even from the original recording; new electronic-sounding instruments and NO vocals are the dub of the song.  Weak. This is the disc that did it for me. One day, two years ago, I was high and listening to this album, and I had a realization.Something like &quot;Reggae's not about who can do what, or how fast they can solo.  It's  about channeling something deeper&quot;Since then my life has changed.  This CD, especially &quot;Thunderstorm Dub&quot; - is profound. It would be strongly advised to listen to the original &quot;Satta  Massagana&quot; recordings before hearing these dub remakes to better bask  in all of the beauty the Abyssinians have to offer, especially those  beautiful voices and harmonies......BUT even if you don't, you can not  help but be amazed by what this album has to offer. You still have the  music pretty much intact, and tasty pieces of the roots reggae vocals that  made Abyssinians songs what they were, on there to whet your appetite for  more of this great trio.For me, however, as much as I love dub albums,  the Abyssinians are best heard in their full vocal glory, and dub, by  definition, will only give you small glimpses into what was really going on  in any session, song, etc. Enjoy this album for the dub it offers- its  straight forward and has great moments on it- but also get the original  &quot;Satta Massagana&quot; lp to fully understand the Abyssinians  experience.","Reggae,Dub,World Music,Pop",first dont even think buying owning original abyssinians vocal group great hear entirety dub mixing credited anyone vintage dub modern dubs vintage mixing boring predictable formulaic creative mixes leave wanting originals vocals never echoed distance play bars stop dub turning instruments weilding instruments like swords slicing sound flowing head good dub create new rhythms using different combinations existing create something sum parts original lacking different instruments different parts completely predictable mixer seems following rules dub play vocals two bars stop play b think buying original abyssinians vocal vocal group group great hear entirety dub mixing credited vintage dub modern dubs vintage mixing boring predictable formulaic creative mixes leave wanting originals vocals echoed distance play bars stop dub turning instruments instruments swords slicing sound flowing head good dub create new rhythms different combinations existing create sum parts original lacking different instruments different parts completely predictable mixer seems following rules dub play vocals bars stop play
135,315,B00000045F,"Everyone likes what they like; but comparing the musicians on this Skatalites CD to those of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones is shocking. To state that the Bosstones are the source for insight or enjoyment for SKA flips reality on its head. It's self explanatory. Foundation Ska! The Skatalites have so many different elements and layers to their groove. There is something for everyone in their music. Love it. The title fits. This was the birth of reggae with Jamaica's Jazz and R&B; supergroup the Skatalites in the 1960s. Hear them back up Bob Marley dn the Wailer's first record ""Smmer Down"" and you will do just the opposite. Enjoy ""Exodis,"" Cool Smoke,"" and their lovely rendition of ""I Should Have Known Better"" (aka Independent Anniversary Ska).But the real bonus here is the late great genius Don Drummond's wailing trombone in ""Eastern Standard Time."" Why more people in the uSA aren't familiar with this is a mystery. But in either case, this is one of those happy Cds that is recommended listening after a hard day. The Skatalites are one of the most fantastic ska bands ever, they practically started ska. The two discs contain the amazing feel of the Skatalites. Def recommend for anyone into old time ska :] wait mighty mighty bosstones are such a terrible band! The skatalites if anything are the main source of influence for many &quot;ska&quot; bands today, due to the fact that the skatalites are pioneers of ska. They were one of the bands that started the whole revolution of ska.. I don't know enough about the history of the Skatalites to say if this is the best or most complete collection of their music that's available, but on its own merits this 2-CD set packs a ska-riffic punch! It's hard to think of a band that so excelled in playing such engaging, upbeat, fun, and joyful music, and yet remains relatively unknown to the listening masses.If this stuff doesn't make me shimmy and shake, it's time for the old folks home! On the surface, this might sound like light, disposable party music, but listen closer and it's obvious that the guys in this band are incredibly talented musicians. Guitars, horns, keyboards all weaving an intricate, but danceable, music tapestry. On those merits, I'm comfortable calling this &#34;Jamaican Jazz&#34;, but nevertheless &#34;Ska&#34; is the foundation and Ska it remains. These two discs are slendid examples of a great, influential band. I agree with Skibz here.  The Bosstones, RBF, LTJ, FIF (ok, enough acronyms), et al. are not traditional ska - they are their own thing.  There's connections and influences, but stepping up onto your pedestal and proclaiming that the heathens listening to these lowly recent bands should listen to 'real' ska does not make any sense.  If someone likes ska-punk, they might absolutely hate traditional ska, and your admonitions will do nothing to change that.  They'll just be given one more reason not to at least try to like it.  If someone disdainfully reproached you for your musical interests, would that really inspire you to look into that person's musical interests?Of course, the reviewer comparing them to the Bosstones was most likely just trying to stir up crap, and has succeeded.  There's more than a few people doing that on here.  Don't take every review as if the person was perfectly serious: I think there is great humor in such facetious posts, as long as you are able to see it for what it is.Now for another realization.  Some of the first few bands I got into were Less Than Jake and Reel Big Fish.  The Bosstones were, and still are, one of my favorite bands.  They are exceptional at what they do.  I *also* like more traditional ska, but I've had enough with the naming of names, and trying to one-up everyone by being more 'pure' in their selection.  I don't feel it's any more 'real' - it's a totally different style, for a totally different mood.Anyway.  The Skatalites are great.  Goodnight./steps down from own pedestal I'm not here to dis any of the other ska movements history has witnessed.  I've got a soft spot in my heart for Third Wave; I started out with the English two-tone stuff.  But you can't beat what the Skatalites put out.  This music is amazing; it'll get your toes tapping or your feet stomping or whatever body part it is you normally use to express your appreciation of good music.There are some awesome tracks here, although my personal favorites are Dick Tracy and Addis Ababa.  The title ""Foundation Ska"" is fitting.  This is the music that made all subsequent ska acts (for better or worse!) possible. This is one of my favorite skatalites CD collections. I love &#34;old rocking chair&#34; and this is the best music to clean you house to. Period. I caught a whiff of this great music late at night on the left side of the dial where the public sponsored stations all hang out in a small, little huddle trying to remain fiercely independent. Most of these stations play incredible music of all types and this was one of the records the midnight DJ spun....Oh, man...this is great stuff. I've always liked ska music, mostly English Beat and General Public, but that music almost sounds contrived compared to the ""real thing""...This music has a jumpy, happy beat...I mean, if you can make the song ""Exodus"" into something you want to dance to, you're onto something.I have very eclectic tastes ranging from the conventional to the obscure. To me, music has the obligation to move the soul. If the soul is happy then the feet will be happy and if the feet are happy the hips will be happy until pretty soon your happy soul will unite with your happy body and you have what we call dancing and as Nietzche said in one of his essays, ""I can only believe in a God that dances...""Well, God does dance, friends, so let the spirit/the soul within you come out to play and buy this fantastic collection. It's a little pricey for something that's over 40 years old, but it still beats a lot of the stuff that's currently ""out there"". Anyone looking for this album knows what they want, and this has it. The Skatalites are probably *the* definition of original ska. Luckily this collection can still be had used; maybe someday it will go back &#34;in print.&#34; Poor imitation of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Huh?!?The Skatalites *started* ska.You didn't think it came from the US did you?This album was recorded in 60's Jamaica, you can't expect crystal clear sound. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones aren't fit to lick the stage these guys played on. Third wave 'ska' is almost all garbage.There are four kinds of ska:1. Traditional aka 'first wave' (60's Jamaica) (ex. Skatalites, Desmond Dekker, Toots &amp; The Maytals).2. Rocksteady (late 60's Jamaican music with a tempo between the Skatalites and reggae) (ex. Phylis Dillon, Alton Ellis, Ken Booth, The Gaylads, The Paragons, Jackie Mittoo and Tommy McCook after the Skatalites broke up).3. 'Two-Tone' aka 'second wave' (early 80's British ska revival) (ex. English Beat, Bad Manners, Madness, The Specials, Selector),4. Neo-trad (90's traditional style) (ex. Jazz Jamaica, The Slackers, Hepcat, The Toasters, Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra)No Doubt is pop, only famous because their singer's a hot chick. The Bosstones are even worse, basically Green Day with a horn section. The Skatalites not only invented the music we call ska, but without them I dare say Jamaican music would have never escalated to the level that it has become. Without the Skatalites there would be no reggae section in the record store. Without the Skatalites the world may have never herd of a man named Bob Marley. The Skatalites were the house band for Studio One in the sixties (the greatest legacy in the history of Jamaican music...one of the greatest in the history of modern music). Without Mr. Dodd, Mr. Alphonso, Mr. Drummond, Mr. McCook and the rest, modern music as we know it would be completely different.Listen to this cd and what you will here is the foundation. Exceptionally talented musicians creating some of the most exciting and innovative sounds that the world has ever known. If you are a Jazz lover and have never herd the Skatalites before, get ready to experience Jazz Jamaican style.This is the true definition of Ska Music. I am appauled by what many people try to pass of as Ska...not naming any names. This is what REAL Ska sounds like.This music is GUARANTEED to lift your spirits and make you shake your booty. If it doesn't then you might want to check your pulse. Keith raises an interesting point about whether Don Drummond would have been good enough to get into a top-line Jazz Band of the time. I don't think there can be any doubt, though he may well have felt more at home musically in Europe rather than the heavily bebop American scene. His blowing on Eastern Standard Time, in particular, is just sublime.How on earth can you compare the lads from the Alpha Boys School with a college thrash band? Im going to make this brief the skatalites rock plain and simple and are at times similar to Joe strummers works, what more can you say? If your looking for the Skatalites then you know what to expect...buy this!  If you've stumbled accross this album because your interested in the roots of various musical gendres then you have found this one for a reason...buy it!  I also HIGHLY recomend checking out Mike Youngs other reviews, very entertaining.Of particular note are Mr. Youngs reviews of -The movie Showtime, quote: ""DeNiro's best movie""The Fleet Adult Enema Twin Pack, quote: ""The two pack is an idea whose time has come.""The movie Air Bud, quote: ""Disturbingly relevant in today's post 9/11 climate""  (He's down with Air Bud 1 and 3 but not 2)The Skatalites Ball of Fire album, quote: ""Ska, which was primarily invented by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Operation Ivy has gotten so big that they're now going back and calling earlier bands, like the Skatalites, ""Ska"" as well."" (read the whole review and try not to make a HUH?!?!?! face)I urge you to take time out to peruse all of Mr. Youngs reviews, nuggets of wisdom in each and every one of them. Creation, expansion and deceasement of ska, served by the original group who started it all down there in Jamaica...a must have. This is a great retrospect of the skatalites back in the late 50s/60s. The booklet is very informative and the music on these 2 discs is quality music. If you consider yourself a rudie, add this to your list of ska bibles. Big ups to the Skatalites! This is an excellent collection of songs. Can't really find a single poor track on either CD. These guys somehow combine a mastery of their craft with the primeval feeling of true ska. If I was to subdivide the many flavors of ska even further, I'd say this was ""Big Band Ska"" - a category the Skatalites own. While I'm generally not too keen on instrumentals, this album is way too good to pass up - and with 32 songs is also a bargain.  Can't imagine a lover of ANY type of ska not enjoying this...  4.5 stars.","Alternative Rock,Reggae,Pop,Rocksteady,Ska,World Music,Jamaican Ska",everyone likes like comparing musicians skatalites cd mighty mighty bosstones shocking state bosstones source insight enjoyment ska flips reality head self explanatory foundation ska skatalites many different elements layers groove something everyone love title fits birth reggae jamaicas jazz r b supergroup skatalites hear back bob marley dn wailers first record smmer opposite enjoy exodis cool smoke lovely rendition known better aka independent anniversary ska real bonus late great genius drummonds wailing trombone eastern standard time people usa arent familiar mystery either case one happy cds recommended listening hard day skatalite likes comparing musicians skatalites cd mighty mighty mighty bosstones mighty mighty bosstones bosstones shocking state bosstones source source insight insight enjoyment ska flips reality head self self explanatory explanatory foundation ska skatalites different elements layers groove love title fits birth reggae jamaicas jazz supergroup skatalites hear dn wailers record opposite enjoy cool smoke lovely rendition known better independent anniversary ska real bonus late great genius wailing trombone eastern eastern standard time standard standard time time people familiar mystery case happy cds recommended listening hard hard day day
136,316,B00000045J,"Probably not as widely acknowledged for his talents as some of reggae bigger names, his impact on the Reggae-pop, Ska & Rocksteady genres is still incalculable.  A celebrated Keyboard Virtuoso.  A founding member of the influential ""Skatalites"" Ska/Rocksteady crew, his solo career was one of a prolific songwriter, who as well as proving the lyrical content for a lot of his productions, was deftly able to completely realise them, with a soothing and carefree upbeats arrangements that looked to the more amiable side of reggae, and arguably possessed a virtuosity with his instrument, that marked him out as a legendary keyboardist.Here we have a 2 Disk compilation of the vast majority of Jackie Mitto's material comprising of some 31 tracks, that date back as far as his time with the 'Skatalites', and it really is a masterclass in (largely) instrumental reggae-pop, that not only adds the more fondly remembered/recognised tracks (""Black Organ, Ghetto Organ, Black out, Mission Impossible, Summer Breeze, Hot Tamale, Drum Song""...etc), there is enough careful consideration to include tracks that although may not have been the one that immediately spring to mind as the very first choices when compiling his work, are arguably deserving of their inclusion here.  At what a selection it is....whether its the funky groove of ""Hot Milk"" or the freewheeling jazz style of ""Drum Song"", or indeed the impossibly catchy bouncy rocksteady of ""Black mans pride"" (my favourite track), his ability of craft meticulously detailed tracks with a myriad of atmospheres, and shifting moods, was what earmarked him as a considerable talenet.  And seeing as Jackie was able to seamlessly reference and incorporate elements of various other styles in his music, you'll find that tracks touch upon, Jazz, Soul, Funk R&B;, soundtracks, traces of Delta blues, energetic reggae, organic flowing instrumentals, earthy compositions, and even a hint of psychedelic pieces, are all thrown into the equation, and all are beautifully performed and arranged, and all perfectly illustrate Mittoo's uncanny ear for melody and rhythm, with a musical flair and level of arranger skills, that are literally second to none.  Both discs represent a perfect (and comprehensive) overview of Jackie collection of work. (And considering how many tracks he had a hand in, a complete summary would be near impossible).  But what impresses with this compilation is that its one of those rare compilations that will probably appeal to both existing fans and newcomers. For the existing fans, you get extensive notes on Jackie's work, and material that covers a fair few of his albums (possibly even a couple that fans won't have in their collections), and for newcomers....they get an brilliant 2 disk package, of the majority of Jackie's most celebrated work (admittedly there are a couple of glaring omissions), in one nice tidy package, that will either (A) Satisfy their curiosity.....or (B) intice them to consider picking up a couple a studio albums.  Whichever way you look at it this is easily one of the best ways to get yourself acquainted with one of reggae most charismatic characters. The late Jackie Mittoo is a huge figure in Jamaican music history. He is highly respected as an arranger, songwriter and great keyboard player.At a memorial concert in Brixton a decade ago, I saw thousands of people turn up to pay their respects to the legend. The music of the former Skatalites keyboardist will appeal to all music lovers, young or old. You do not have to like Reggae to appreciate Jackie Mittoo as his music is so much more. Warm, funky, sensitive, urgent, amusing...this music is all this at once! The recordings come from Mittoos peak in the 60s and 70s at Coxson Dodd's Studio One. It encompasses elements of Ska, Reggae, soul, Funk, Rocksteady, Boogie, Organ Jazz, Nyabinghi, and Pop. Music does not come any better than this. Jackie Mittoo should be spoken of in the same breath as Jimmy Smith, Brother Jack McDuff, Booker T and all the other greats of Hammond organ. If you only buy one CD this year, make sure it is this one!!! Throughout the 60's and 70's Jackie Mittoo was making funky music with the best of them.  I can't even begin to imagine how many of today's artists were partially inspired by Mittoo.  From a solo artist to the keyboardist of the famous Skatalites,  Jackie left us with a load of incredible music to enjoy.This album has some of Jackie's most incredible collection of songs.  &quot;Hot Tamale&quot; is an incredible reggae song.  &quot;Black Organ&quot; has some of the thickest reggae grooves I've heard to date.  You can't help but smile and nod your head when you listen to this work because it's just so good and so mellow.  It's perfect summertime music.  It will take the pain away in an instant.In the late 60's and early 70's, Jamaica was making some incredible music that was extremely far ahead of its time.  With labels such as Universal Sound and Studio One, we are lucky to have many of these artists and albums re-released today.Although this is a great collection, I just picked up a compilation today from Jackie Mittoo on Universal Sound that just has impeccable sound quality.  I would suggest searching for that one first.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't want to take anything away from this cd, either.  Either would be great if you are looking to hear some of the best reggae ever.Do yourself a favor.  Get anything by Jackie Mittoo.  If you're not really into reggae, this may just be the introduction you've been waiting for.  I highly suggest listening to this essential reggae.","Reggae,Jamaica,Tributes,Pop,Rocksteady,World Music,Caribbean & Cuba",probably widely acknowledged talents reggae bigger names impact reggae pop ska rocksteady genres still incalculable celebrated keyboard virtuoso founding member influential skatalites ska rocksteady crew solo career one prolific songwriter well proving lyrical content lot productions deftly able completely realise soothing carefree upbeats arrangements looked amiable side reggae arguably possessed virtuosity instrument marked legendary keyboardist disk compilation vast majority jackie mittos material comprising date back far time skatalites really masterclass largely instrumental reggae pop adds fondly remembered recognised black organ ghetto organ black mission impossible summer breeze hot tamale drum etc probably widely acknowledged talents bigger names impact reggae pop pop ska rocksteady genres incalculable celebrated keyboard virtuoso founding founding member member influential skatalites crew solo career prolific songwriter proving lyrical content lot productions deftly able completely realise soothing carefree upbeats arrangements looked amiable side reggae arguably possessed virtuosity instrument marked legendary keyboardist disk compilation vast majority jackie material comprising date far time skatalites really largely instrumental reggae reggae pop pop adds fondly recognised black organ ghetto organ black mission mission impossible impossible summer breeze hot hot tamale drum

140,322,B00000048F,"'Housefire' was originally released in 1985 but went fairly unnoticed and quickly went out of print, until Bullseye Records re-released it onto CD, and we can thank then for that.  It is a fine showcase for Byther Smith's talent, and while it may not be as solid as some of his other albums, it is very fine none-the-less.  All but one song is an original, a stinging cover of Detroit Junior's ""Money Tree"" which opens the CD.  The rest are all Smiity's own, and showcase his very intense style.  With song titles like ""The Man Want's me Dead"", you know he means business.  Even the instrumental ""Knockdown"" has a powerful driving force to it that grab's your attention quickly.  ""Live on and Sing the Blues"" is one of the most powerful slow blues I have heard in a while and you believe Smitty that he has lived the blues life when you hear him.""Housefire"" may not be as good as the recently re-released 'Hold That Train', but it is still a fine album of blues that any fan of Byther Smith's must have. Byther Smith has recorded several gorgeous albums (avaiblable on Delmark and Bullseye records); among them, HouseFire might be the best one : producers took their time to choose the best musicians, to rehearsal several days - which is rare for blues records -, and to improve the sound and the arrangement of each song. So the gutwrenching singing, the splendid guitar playing, the terrific lyrics of Byther Smith could reach a level close to the best Westside Chicago blues ever recorded - Otis Rush for Cobra, Buddy Guy for Vanguard.Listen to the tragical ""Live on and sing the blues"", the paranoiac ""Man wants me dead"", the angry ""Martha dear"", the desperate and funny ""Wait and see"". And the instrumental ""Knockdown"" could have been played by Magic Sam on his Delmark albums.

141,324,B0000004AN,"For fans of electric Chicago Blues played by white guys who are Blues-Rockers, this is probably a great album. However, for people like me, who love the old Blues from the 1920s and '30s, and the classics from Chess Records, this album is a pure snoozefest. When I was fifteen years old, I would have loved the endless solo-ing on this album. These days, I'm looking for what I look for in the great Country Blues records of yesteryear: story-telling, meaning, emotive vocals, and, sure, expressive guitar playing. If you're a huge fan of Stevie Ray Vaughan and think he is Jesus Christ, then buy this album. Personally, this record put me to sleep. This is an exceptional live blues album. The songs are a good mix between boogie woogie and slow blues. Although I like Ronnie Earl's guitar playing and he is truly a master, I like his guitar playing better as part of the song versus the centerpiece of the song. Therefore I liked the songs with Jimmy Rogers singing better.Call it my age, but hard driving, loud electric guitar blues is just not for me. Give me a great soulful blues singer, like Jimmy Rogers, backed up with an acoustic or slide guitar any day.Jimmy Rogers is one of the all time great bluesmen and in this album he is backed up by a great guitarist - Ronnie Earl, harmonica player - Sugar Ray, and keyboardist - Dave Maxwell.This is a great album, worthy of six stars. I'm a big Blues fan. I'm partial to the old Blues, but I can appreciate good new Blues as well, as found in this record by JIMMY ROGERS and RONNIE EARL. There are no words to define the category of this record. The big class of JIMMY, one of the greats, shines all along, but above all there is RONNIE EARL's extraordinary guitar. I had the opportunity to see RONNIE live in BARCELONA in 1998. He played themes from his LP ""Colour Of Love"" and I was very impressed.Now while writing these lines I'm listening to the wonderful song that opens the record ""Okie Dokie Stomp"" (of which the extraordinary Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown has several magnificent versions in some of his LPs). But when you listen to ""Blues in D-Natural"" or ""Same old Blues""  you realize how important this the record is: just incredible. This live recording in Germany in honor of Chicago Blues has plenty of feeling, containing classics like ""Got My Mojo Working"" and ""Shake Your Money Maker"", from the time when Jimmy Rogers played as a bandmate of the great Muddy Waters, and songs composed by Jimmy as ""Rock this House"" and the delightful ""Gold Tailed Bird"" (what a big work by Ronnie Earl's strong guitar). Both Sugar Ray Norcia on harmonica and Dave Maxwell on piano provide outstanding contributions. In short: a great Chicago blues album, great guitar playing and as always Jimmy's great voice. 5 Stars! Highly recommended. In the pursuit of my passion for the Blues I sought out this CD due to hearing the cut ""Blues in D-Natural"". It is a riveting track that stuck in my mind long after I heard it. It was attributed to Ronnie Earl and the Broadcasters, but fortunately Amazon led me to find the Jimmy Rodgers title and overall disc. This is a live recording in Germany that is a celebration and restrospective of Chicago Blues in both sound and feel. Containing classics like ""Got My Mojo Working"" and ""Shake Your Money Maker"", based upon Jimmiy Rodgers time as a bandmate of the great Muddy Waters, this is a living tribute to an influential blues player. Jimmy leads the show but allows the respective players plenty of time in the spotlight to show their expertise. It is apparent that everyone is having a good time and the intimacy of the players comes through. I felt good listening to this offering and return to it often. In addition to Ronnie Earl's strong guitar work, both Sugar Ray Norcia on harmonica and Dave Maxwell on piano provide outstanding contributions. In summary this is a fun and spontaneous effort that is sure to please. ""Okie Dokie Stomp"" is reason enough to get this but you also get a ""High Quality""  live recording of the Fabulous Jimmy Rogers. this is a real gem. If you love blues you need this in your collection.  The price here on amazon is Great too !","Electric Blues,Blues,Regional Blues,Pop,Chicago Blues",fans electric chicago blues played white guys blues rockers probably great however people like love old blues classics chess records pure snoozefest fifteen years old would loved endless solo ing days im looking look great country blues records yesteryear story telling meaning emotive vocals sure expressive guitar playing youre huge fan stevie ray vaughan think jesus christ buy personally record put sleep exceptional live blues good mix boogie woogie slow blues although like ronnie earls guitar playing truly master like guitar playing better part versus centerpiece therefore liked jimmy rogers singing better call age hard driving loud electric guitar blues fans electric chicago chicago blues blues played white guys blues rockers probably great people love old blues classics chess chess records records pure snoozefest years old loved endless solo days looking look great country country blues blues records story story telling telling meaning emotive vocals sure expressive guitar playing youre huge fan stevie stevie ray stevie ray vaughan ray vaughan think jesus jesus christ buy personally record sleep exceptional live blues good mix boogie boogie woogie slow blues ronnie ronnie earls earls guitar playing truly master guitar playing better centerpiece liked jimmy singing better call age hard driving loud electric electric guitar guitar blues

143,330,B0000004E0,"It's all here.  All the songs the Zombies ever recorded, well about 99% of them anyway.  In all honesty Zombie Heaven is the greatest sounding Zombies collection ever put out.  And all the songs are in their original mono or stereo mixes.If you are a Zombies fan this is an indispensable addition to your collection. Perfect for feeding a Zombies jones.  Making an air-tight case for the Zombies, with signature minor key changes and gossamer harmonies, as one of the best bands of the 60's.  And Odessey & Oracle as a worthy peer of Pet Sounds, Forever Changes, the Doors eponymous debut, and Piper at the Gates of Dawn.The St Alban's schoolboys made music that manages haunting, wistful, and joyous all in the same breathy vocals of Colin Blunstone and in Rod Argent and Chris White's tunes and arrangments.  Any band that can rehab Little Anthony & the Imperials merits automatic elevation into the pantheon.Though this is heresy to Zombie fans, I'd still recommend tracking down the Odessey & Oracle anniversary set for the stereo mixes.And if you can't get enough Zombies (and indeed who can?) check out Big Beat's companion piece: Into the Afterlife. Everyone else has already praised the Zombies to the high heavens (as they should) but I was just browsing around and was stunned to see the 17.98 price.  For over 100 tracks of some of the finest 60's pop ever?  I bought mine around ten years ago, and it was at least $70, and money well spent.  Don't hesitate; buy this thing now. Mostly dismissed in their own time as rudimentary beatsers, the Zombies were actually far more inventive than their three hits bely, as Zombie Heaven proves beyond all doubt.  There were few more capable popsmiths in  their time than Rod Argent or Chris White, and no vocalist could match the  sweetly chilling atmosphere conjured by Colin Blunstone's frosty pipes.  Their fully-rendered melodicism surpassing that of even the Beatles (John  Lennon wanted to produce them, by the way), they are rivalled only by Brian  Wilson's contemporaneous work with the Beach Boys, and as with that group,  digging deeper than the most obvious hits in the Zombies' catalogue can  only be rewarding.  Zombies Heaven collects all the group's single and LP  tracks in one place, including the entirety of their 1968 pet sounds Odessy  and Oracle, BBC sessions, plus dozens of cuts only rumored to exist  previously.  Few groups warrant the fanatical kind of devotion exemplified  here, and were it anybody else this would be excessive, but the Zombies  were simply too good, and the ridiculous proliferation of box sets devoted  to undeserving two-hit schleps is almost justified by the sheer quality of  this collection, if only it means that there is more to come from such  woefully overlooked acts whose master tapes are currently languishing in  record company vaults. Bought this box set after seeing this incredible band live last year(which is a can't miss show) and had very high expectations for the set that were all unexpectedly surpassed. Bottom line is, this is some of the most inventive, infectious, brilliant music I have had the pleasure of listening to. The box set is so precise and well put together that it takes you on a ride like no other. In my humble opinion their 64-65 material rivals not only the beatles and the beach boys in its progressively experimental musical landscapes but surpasses some of their peers tracks from that time period. Seamless interweaving of gorgeous pop melodies with jazz chord structures and strange but utterly fascinating tempo/time changes. This is the kind of music when you first hear it it blows your mind and is so magical gets you high naturally which the best art often can do. I never listen to music over and over but with this set its absolutely addicting music that you hear something new each time you listen to it. Lyrically incredible as well with clever, poignant often brutally honest lyrics about love and relationships that mask the romantic fears and despair of the songwriters with inspirational upbeat music that pack quite a punch in their polar opposites to stunning effect. Just try and count the bands who attempted this music and just could not hold a candle to the zombies. If you are here because of their 3 massive US hits and were curious to hear more, feel confident that you will forget about those undoubted masterpieces as soon as you hear the quality of the rest of their work. I could go on and on about possibly one of the most underrated bands in musical history but do yourself a favor and buy this box set. You won't regret it I can guarantee that and you will open yourself up to a world of incredible music that you didn't know existed and probably kicking yourself like me you didn't discover it years ago! This is truly Zombie Heaven and it's contains everything they did as a group before breaking up in the early 70's. There are some fantastic stories in the book that comes with this 4 CD set. They reformed the band in early 2000's and have been touring since then. I've been lucky enough to see them twice recently! If you are a fan of The Zombies you need this collection! First of all, as of this writing, there are 33 other reviews on this release and every single one is 5 stars.  How often do you see that?  I'm going to be the 34th, because this set is THE DEAL.Fantastic music, fits within the time period it came from AND also sounds modern enough to be enjoyed today.  Far ahead of their time and gone too soon, The Zombies deserve far more appreciation than their minor amount of chart success so long ago.  Buy this with confidence and enjoy! Like so many people my age, I only knew the Zombies' three signature hits.  Odessey & Oracle was merely a recommendation to me based on my musical preferences, but when I sampled it, I knew there was something very special about this short-lived British 60s group.  I will tell you one thing right now:  I love 60s Brit bands, but where the Dave Clark Five seemed like so much excessive Beatles wannabe confetti, and the Hollies could go from awesome to repellent in 0.5 seconds, the Zombies were indeed underrated, overly talented, and nothing short of brilliant.This compilation features 4 discs, all worth listening to in their own right.  In order to avoid a long review, I will say that this is the best 75 bucks I've ever spent on a box set, and I have several! From their earliest tracks to their last, the group consistently showed excellent taste in material, be it written by others or Chris White and Rod Argent, stellar vocal harmonies, and a penchant for constantly reinventing themselves.  Amazing that, based on how silly they could often look in press photos, their music is often downright sexy, ""Time of the Season"" not withstanding.Fave tracks are far too many to mention, but I will recommend just about everything because it is all tasteful and superbly done.  In fact, I mess with this anthology so much, I've begun looking into purchasing individual discs to save wear and tear on this one.  Exceptional in every way, not just another 60s British beat band, the group offered a more genuine version of blue-eyed soul infused with jazz and classical influences, lovely Brit dialect harmonies, and superior musicianship.  Quality, not quantity, would definitely be the way to sum up their short 60s career and, yes, Colin Blunstone's voice and looks are all too appealing!  Purchase Zombie Heaven; I guarantee you won't be sorry. Growing up listening to my dad's collection of Beatles, Rolling Stones, and early Bee Gees (before the falsetto phase), I'd say I've had a pretty good foundation to base my musical inspiration from early on. When I saw this collection of the Zombies released, I had to get it for me... uh, I mean, for my dad! ;) Up 'til now, the most treasured album (LP) that my father has is a mint, mid-60's release of the Zombies best hits (cannot recall the title though, but it has the never-seen-again group shot in a purple hue). I never thought that that Zombies collection would ever be surpassed in its importance and content, until this release came out (for ex: ""The Way I Feel Inside"" done other than in mono, fully-plugged, in rehearsal?? One of my favorite songs ever in a version other than the commercially-recognised, semi-acappella, done by the original group in their hey-day - I've never thought it existed!)... to describe this collection in one word: MASTERPIECE!!! This is a great collection of the bands entire career. It has all of their first album &quot;Begin Here&quot; plus all of their singles A &amp; B sides. It also has their 60's classic &quot;Odessey &amp; Oracle&quot; plus  live bbc appearences and rare radio interviews. This set also includes  demos and previously unrealeased songs that are classics like &quot;Call of  the Night&quot; and &quot;Out of the Day&quot;. It gives a rockin' and  blues kind of feel on the first disc with songs like &quot;Sticks and  Stones&quot; and &quot;Just out of Reach&quot;. This set carries the bands  major hits &quot;She's Not There&quot; &quot;Tell Her No&quot; and their  last big hit that occured in 1969 &quot;Time of the Season&quot;. The  booklet that comes with this magical set of songs is great. It contains  tons of photos and what they did on certain dates in certain years. Rod,  Colin, Paul, Chris, and Hugh all speak of what was happening in their lives  while they were in The Zombies. Great collection so buy it!!!! A must have for all Zombies fans.  Includes just about everything the Zombies ever recorded.  Probably the most underrated band of the 60's.  Of particular interest are the rare unreleased recordings and alternate takes. When I was in High School(in the late 70's) I inherited 'Odessey(sic)and Oracle' from my older sister. I immediately fell under the spell of the gorgeous and often haunting melodies therein. Somehow the magic pierced  through the many clicks, pops,and massive thumps of a much played album.  When I tried to obtain a fresh copy of the Zombies 'Odessey and Oracle', it  was out of print. However the selections were contained in Time of the  Zombies compilation. But unfortunately that album was also unavailable. It  seemed that all Zombies' material was lost and forgotten forever. It just  couldn't survive the Disco and Heavy Metal music of the 1970's.  And  through the next 15 years, it seemed that finding Zombies recordings was  like a quest for the Holy Grail or the Philosopher's Stone. Then in 1987  Rhino released Odessey and Oracle in Compact disc and vinyl form (I  purchased both)and See For Miles records released &quot;The Zombies Singles  A's and B's&quot;. I was thrilled, but there was more of their music to  search out. So I bought many import collections (with seemingly endless  repeats of 'She's Not There' and 'Tell Her No' among others). I even bought  a Japanese import of 'Odessey and Oracle' just to get the 6 or 7 bonus  tracks.  So here we are with &quot;Zombie Heaven&quot;.This box set saves  people in the new mellineum alot of time and money trying to find all of  the Zombies material with excellent sound quality. It even provides a  booklet that is a thorough chronology of the groups history.  My  favourites are the spooky 'I Remember When I Loved Her&quot; (which  contains the neatest organ solo this side of Procol Harum's 'Shine On  Brightly'),  the shimmering 'Beechwood Park', the lofty rendition of  'Summertime' and the psychedelic 'Hung Up On a Dream'.My favourite rarities  are 'A Rose For Emily' (with cello and flute) and the their rendition of  Dusty Springfield's (whom I felt Colin had a vocal kindredship to) 'The  Look Of Love'.  &quot;Zombie Heaven&quot; is a long overdo testament to  the Zombies' place in the rock upper echelon.Many thanks to Art Palao for  doing such a fine job and to The Zombies for creating such fine music (and  cooperating with Art). I got this for someone as a gift but he said it was pretty good. It has a lot of songs that are never heard these days but were popular back in the day. I got way more than I expected. I was afraid I was just re-purchasing a bunch of stuff I already had.The original mono mixes on the first CD were a revelation. I may have had a couple of singles way back when, but everything else I'd ever heard was the stereo re-mixes and did not know there was a difference until now. I did not know that was what I was getting until I played it.There are tons of other rarities & unreleased tracks on the other 3 CD's. The booklet was more like a book. It's a great history of the band & the songs in the set.I don't know why I waited so long to buy this. The Zombies are love. Next, buy this set.  The more articulate listeners  above have told you about the craftsmanship and simply outstanding music of the world's most  stunning group.After the Zombies recorded their last album, they  disbanded.  Why?  Their music was simply too advanced for their time.  Now  its 1999 and the listening public have caught up with them -- shimmering  harmonies, incredible melodies, unreal musicianship, and the singular  vocals of Colin Blunstone.  These guys had the courage to step out.  This  collection starts with the early stuff; blues and jazz influenced,  surprisingly effective soul music... songs that will stay with you. All the  hits are there, but this time from first generation masters.  The timeline  concludes with their famous Odessy and Oracle.  The box also includes one  of the most complete, detailed, and exhaustive booklets ever, with forward  by Tom Petty.  If you get this set and never buy another album, you'll have  no regrets.  It just doesn't get any better. Crank it up. The Zombies' first album, with ""She's Not There"" and ""Tell Her No"" was excellent.  ""Odessey and Oracle"" was even better, but it's only in retrospect that I realize how superior it was to almost anything else that was released during that period.  And listening to it now, it's clear that it has held up well over the decades, not sounding dated at all.  And the closer you listen the more you realize that these guys were really GOOD!The Zombie Heaven box set delivers another BIG surprise.  When they broke up, they still had enough unreleased material recorded to make up another album nearly as good as Odessey and Oracle.  (These songs comprise ""The Lost Album"" in this collection).  The Zombies left stuff behind that was better than nearly anything that other bands were selling. ""She Loves the Way They Love Her"", ""Imagine the Swan"", ""Girl Help Me"", ""I Could Spend the Day"" and ""Smokey Day"" rank with the best work the group ever produced, and if not for the release of this set, would have been all but forgotten.  Likewise, ""If It Don't Work Out"", ""Don't Cry For Me"", ""Walking in the Sun"" and ""I'll Call You Mine"".  These are first-rate tunes!  The harmony is so good at times that it will make you weep!  (She Loves the Way They Love Her). Colin Blunstone is, in fact, one of the great vocalists in pop music history, with an instantly recognizable voice.Any fans of the band, ""Argent"" will love this collection, too.  This collection is the ""missing link"" between A(rgent) and Z(ombies), since this was the transition period when keyboard wizard Rod Argent was forming ""Argent"", and he and bassist Chris White were solidifying their song-writing partnership.  A few of the ""Lost Tunes"" like ""Imagine the Swan"" are more ""Argent"" tunes than Zombies, especially with Rod singing lead.Although their early lyrics were nowhere nearly as sophisticated as their music, by the time ""Odessey and Oracle"" was released, they had bridged this gap. Tunes like ""A Rose For Emily"", ""Brief Candles"" and ""Care of Cell 44"" tell wonderful stories without resorting to cliches.Disc one, ""Begin Here and Singles"" includes songs from their first album and all of the ""A-side"" and ""B-side"" of their singles released on 45's.  I use the quotes because their ""B-sides"" were as good as the ""A-sides"", not just throw-away seconds.  Good tune after good tune.  A few, like ""Road Runner"" are dated, but the rest hold up amazingly well after 35 years or so, especially ""Whenever You're Ready"", ""Leave Me Be"", and ""Indication"".  This was/is still really good music!Don't let yourself miss out on the pleasure of this collection.  It's worth every cent, because you'll discover many wonderful tunes that you may have never heard before, that you will find yourself humming at odd times, and you'll realize...""Hey, I really LIKE that song!"" The ZombiesZombie Heaven (4 CD box with 66 page `tall-boy' book)Between the Product Description found on this page, as well as a few excellent customer reviews, there is little reason to add anything to what has already been said, except to add my own voice to the praise that this 4 CD set deserves.  The Zombies hold an undeniably important place in the history of 1960s Rock and Roll and this comprehensive set reveals the excellence of their songs far beyond the few classic hits they had produced.  This is a Five Star release. You know , I paid well over $50 for this when it came out .....I still don't regret it , but at less than a Jackson , you'd better snatch this up ! A lovingly assembled and performed package bulging with unreleased tracks and the like.  B_U_Y  I_T  N_O_W !!! After reading several of the reviews and after hearing the box set, I am wondering why this group is not in the RRHOF.  Is it another political reason? I received this box set as a gift from my wife.  I wish I had bought this sooner. This collection demonstrated just how good The Zombies were.  I hope to catch them on tour sometime.  Great collection. A boxed set from a bunch of guys who only had 3 or 4 hit records at best? What could be on it? PUUULLLENTY. And is it any good? YOU BETCHA! 119 numbers from a 4 year period. These guys were PROLIFIC and just about the most hard lucked band of the Briish Invasion. Trouble with their work permits kept them from capitalizing on their fame here, when they hit right out of the box with SHE'S NOT THERE. Bad luck, bad management, trouble with unions did not stop these guys from plugging away. This set is like finding a treasure trove of GOOD British Invasion records you never heard before. Rave-ups, eerie introspective numbers (way before they were in vogue), and just plain wonderful pop songs permeate this fantastic sounding 4 disc set. That's info for the uninitiated. For those in the know, there's mono and rare stereo versions, overdubbed and pre-overdubbed versions, studio chatter and rehearsals, live at the BBC recordings, a massive 65 page booklet that goes through the band's history and track by track breakdown and commentary from the guys, a ton of photos, and just about everything this group ever recorded. Very,very few clunkers. Despite two timeless #1 hits (at the begining and end of their career) the Zombies need to be re-evaluated as one the top groups of the British Invasion. And this set is the proof. Possibly one of the most underrated British invasion groups from the 1960s.The group was actually a little more successful in the U.S. than the U.K.They sounded every bit as smart as they probably were, never making it a secret they were british singers with those accents of theirs that sounded so right. Even when doing a R&B; type song.This boxset is the answer to anything you wanted to hear from them.Unreleased songs, as well as demos, radio spots, and of course the great ""Odessy and Oracle"" album.Yes, it goes way beyond any greatest hits CD, but, for a good reason, on this you get everything, hearing all of what this underrated group does is important to Zombies fans. You've heard the hits already, now hear the left behind morsels and the hits too.What a great boxset, with a booklet that tells you just about everything. If you can afford it, buy it. I received my order promptly. I gave it as a Christmas gift and my son was very happy with the purchase. The Zombies are on par with the Beatles, The Who, the Kinks, and better the overrated Rolling Stones. These guys wrote more complex music than anyone outside of Brian Wilson. The melodies are positively shimmering. Buy this box. It has everything they ever recorded and all of it is worthwhile. Why did I put off buying this gem for so long?  I'll tell you.  The price.  I always loved the Zombies, Argent, Colin's solo works, and I still have the vinyl recordings.  When I first saw this, my super-ego kicked in, and for a while my id was in deep pain.  Why is it so expensive?  Well, I found out the answer.  It's worth it.  Imagine clean sound, great stereo mixes where available, unearthed BBC recordings, brilliant liner notes.  This is the real deal.  Plus you realize that this was a band for the ages.  Worth every penny.  Come on, you're worth it, too. Mono is a disease, it squeezes the life out of music but that's they way they recorded it.  The band is great and the music top notch, but frankly I will have to also search for stereo versions of these songs wether they are remixed or not. I don't know what the hell they were thinking back then. It was 1964 (onward)  and by that date few were recording in that flat format. Oh well. If you want it all in mono then it's all here. And that's better than nothing. I do love this band though as they were awesome in spite of the mono recordings. The Zombies were one of the most talented British bands of the 1960's. You could say that this band had it all: Two prolific songwriters, two outstanding singers and four great musicians.This 4 CD box contains all their released material ( singles, EP's, albums etc. ) + a vast amount of rarities; demos, outtakes, alternate takes and live recordings.Most of their original output is well-known, and the majority of it is simply outstanding.They only released two albums in their time. Their first. ""Begin Here"" is an uneven mixture of rhythm'n blues standards and Zombies originals.Their covers of songs like ""I Got My Mojo"" and ""Roadrunner"" I have always thought their weakest output. Their vocals simply do not fit the r&b; style. But apart from these few exceptions, all their released material is first class.Unfortunately their success in the singles charts was short-lived; even though they released great singles throughout their career. They experienced an unexpected come-back in 1969 with ""Time of the Season"", but this was at a time, when they had practically split-up.Their second ( and last released ) album ""Odessey and Oracle"" is considered a rock-classic - which is very well-deserved.A third album was planned for release, to cash in on the success of ""Time of the Season"", but this album called ""R.I.P"" was unfortunately never released. All tracks from this abandoned album are also included on ""Zombie Heaven"".Try to programme your CD player and hear how it would have sounded. Personally I think it comes very close to the high level of ""Odessey and Oracle""CD 1 contains their first album and early singles.CD 2 contains ""Odessey and Oracle"" and ""R.I.P"" + a few alternate version.CD 3 is the rarities CD featuring Previously unreleased demos and various rare recordings.CD 4 is all BBC live recordings, showcasing the Zombies as a terrific live-band.The 64 pages booklet ( high-quality paper and print ) is sheer pleasure. The book simply has it all: Foreword by Tom Petty, biography, extensive discography, notes to all tracks, plenty of photos, reproductions of single-covers etc.This CD box is simply highly recommendable. The zombies are so the british invasion leader's !! their songs are all classic swininging, hipped,rocking ,60's groovy rock pop music with hints of r and b !!  coilin blunstone's voice is so sexy very english smokey cool !! rod argents soulful keyboard playing gets down to the groove. I'ts a shame the zombies didn't stick around for higher success . they are truly classic british 60's invasion! i classify them next to the beatles and rolling stones . such a shame they broke up so soon, our lost !!!! Buy zombies heaven and relive the ultimate british invasion . CHEERS ! When you like me were introduced to The Zombies by the dvd Live at Bloomsbury theatre and Andorra and I want to fly are in your all time Zombies top 10, you will be dissapointed to not find them on this magnificent compilation of Zombies hits called Heaven.Andorra and i want to fly are songs written later than the periode covered by Heaven. So be sure to not only buy Heaven but also a copy of their concert in Bloomsbury. That way you really have it all ! The Zombies for me are one of the most underrated bands in the history of music. They should have been right up there with all the big names, but due to hard luck i guess and maybe their name (?) they were not. They will be performing in The Netherlands and i will be there !  I am sure it's gonna be one of the best concerts i have ever seen with Colin Blunstone (magnificent voice) and keyboardwizard Rod Argent and the other guys on stage. Multiple box sets for the Zombies in fact more than The Who - this is the one box set to get.  Second one to get Original stereo Zombies. Very underrated band. Pretty much everything they recorded on here. The live tracks especially are a nice treat. And I love that keyboard sound! The Zombies were the ultimate white R&B; group from England.  Guys like Tom Petty grew up idolizing these guys and the reasons are easy to see on this box set.  You get everything the guys did in the studio and a ton of BBC recordings on the 4th disc.I am not that crazy about the 3rd disc - out takes and alternate takes - it's the music on discs 1, 2, and 4 that make this a pleasurable listening experience. The stereo mix and mastering of all these tracks are fantastic! This is one of the better remastered CD's out there if you're like me, and suddenly get the urge to own about ten best of packages of artists from the British Invasion.  How can it be that a group that only has about three Top 40 singles, have such a wonderful collection of material that never really charted?  What went wrong with The Zombies?  I put these guys right up there with the Early to Mid-era Beatles.  Of course you get their main three hits singles:She's Not There (#2) 1964Tell Her No (#6) 1964Time of the Season (#3) 1969But, this four CD collection has so many other fabulous songs, including my favorites ""I Remember When I Loved Her"" and ""Imagine The Swan.""  The entire ""Odessey and Oracle"" album is here including some alternate takes and remixes, and the fourth CD is some material recorded on the BBC radio show where the DJ discusses with the guys about their music and even their intentions of breaking up.If you have to have only a single disc collection of the best of The Zombies, I'm sure it's out there.  But, this is the collection to have.  Look at all the 5 star ratings!  What does that tell you?!Anyway, if you're like me, you can't just have one CD of an artist from the British Invasion. I just went nuts one day and ordered about 10 or 15 collections from various British Invasion artists, which included:Gerry and the PacemakersBilly J. Kramer and the DakotasHerman's HermitsThe AnimalsThe WhoChad and JeremyPeter and GordonThe HolliesThem (featuring Van Morrison)The SearchersThe Dave Clark FiveThe KinksThe Rolling StonesBee GeesPetula ClarkDusty SpringfieldOf course, I already had all The Beatles that I need, so having that and all these CD's shuffling in my CD Carousel make for hours of British Invasion bliss.About 20 years ago, Rhino Records had a 9 CD collection of the The British Invasion which included many one-hit-wonders and cool obscurities. If you are one to have that collection, I am certain that you are the envy of many. I was too stupid to realize that I should have kept it. The zombies have not been neglected on CD but if you are a true fan this is the only collection you should consider.  It contains virtually everything the group recorded for both DECCA and CBS.  The sound quality is superb, although I was initially disappointed that the DECCA material was  not in stereo, having stereo mixes on other CDS.  However, after reading  the excellent booklet notes by Alec Palao, I accept that mono is the way  these tracks should be heard. (the Decca material has since been issued in wonderful stereo on a 2CD collection & is also essential for fans).  Listening to songs like ""what more can  I do"" and ""summertime"" convinces me that the Zombies were  one of the 60's best groups. ""I remember when I loved her"" sounds  like it was recorded in a graveyard at midnight,with ethereal organ and  tambourine which sends chills up my spine. There are so many great tracks,  including many unreleased until now, that it is amazing that the group had  so few hits.The booklet is the best I have seen in a box set and should  be a model for other compilers. All CBS tracks are stereo.  Don't hesitate,  buy it and you will be in ZOMBIE HEAVEN. Alright-let's agree on this-THE ZOMBIES, along with THE HOLLIES, were two of the best pop-rock groups to come out of England.  Yes, I know, there's THE BEATLES-and they're pretty unbeatable in the pop-rock arena.  But what I'm saying is, get past THE BEATLES-it's THE HOLLIES and THE ZOMBIES all the way.  And like THE HOLLIES, I own the first couple of ZOMBIES albums, along with a set of their 'A"" and 'B' Singles collection, and some live BBC stuff-that's it.In the review I wrote on THE HOLLIES (""Clarke, Hicks & Nash""), I said ""Some of us (including me) may have been missing the boat here.""  Well, I have to admit it's also happened with THE ZOMBIES.  Other bands of the period have released good things (THE SEARCHERS come to mind) but THE ZOMBIES were consistently good-sometimes brilliant.  They had the songs, those great vocals, and that certain way of putting their songs across.And the way to hear them is in this box set.  It contains almost everything they did-it's only missing a very few stray songs that no one can find-maybe someday.  But for now and the foreseeable future, this is the set to hear.  Subtle and great.  Pick this up sooner rather than later-and while you're at it-pick up THE HOLLIES set mentioned above.  A perfect one-two punch of British pop-rock greatness.  It's never too late to catch the boat. The Zombies where one of the most under rated British groups of the 60's. They had a jazz tinged style that was different to most beat groups of the day, founded on Colin Blunstone's magical voice and Rod Argent's keyboards. Zombie Heaven is a marvellous collection that does the Zombies' legacy justice. This awesome box set is by far the easiest (and probably cheapest, as long as you have the money to drop all at once) way to get all of the Zombies' released material--and then some!  You really have to hand it to Big Beat--the Zombies' catalogue (particularly the singles) has been repackaged & re-released time and time again almost since their breakup...but with Zombie Heaven, Big Beat delivers the Zombies' entire works on four CD's, all of which are filled nearly to the brim (a standard CD holds 80 minutes of sound, and all four programs here are in excess of 70).  That's not all you get, however.  Also included is an invaluable 68-page book with information on every track and a comprehensive history of the group, told mostly by the Zombies themselves.Disc 1 - Begin Here and SinglesAs the title suggests, this disc includes the Zombies' debut album, Begin Here, and most of their A- & B-sides that did not appear on any album (the remainder are on disc 2).  Begin Here has been described as a ""typical"" album of its time, and while that's somewhat true, I believe there's more to it than that.  The album does contain a couple lukewarm covers, but those are outweighed by such gems as ""I Can't Make Up My Mind,"" their jazzy rendition of ""Summertime,"" ""I Remember When I Loved Her,"" and ""I Don't Want To Know,"" which has a 12-string guitar intro with a sound that a certain folk-rock band would popularize a year later.  As for the singles, there isn't a weak one in the bunch, though only two of them (""She's Not There"" & ""Tell Her No"") were successful, which calls into question what the public was instead listening to at the time (well, okay, the Beatles)...even George Harrison said at the time that he couldn't understand why the Zombies weren't being more successful.Disc 2 - Odessey & Oracle and The Lost AlbumThis is the best of the four discs because it contains the magical Odessey & Oracle album.  It also has the tracks intended for the aborted R.I.P. project--six songs recorded in the late 60's and 5 more great ones which the Zombies recorded earlier in their career but never released (plus ""I'll Call You Mine""), done up with overdubbed strings & vocals.  And if you don't care for the overdubbed versions, Zombie Heaven gives you the freedom of choice and you can listen to the originals on disc 3!Disc 3 - In The Studio / Rare & UnissuedThe third disc is a bit of a hodgepodge.  The songs range from ones that had been officially released in formats such as EP's but are extremely hard to find to demos of songs that went (regretfully) unreleased.  There are also full-band demos of songs which were later released, which hurts the disc a little because these demos usually aren't too incredibly different from the finished versions, just understandably rawer and less slick.  It's too bad there weren't original home demos of these songs in their infant state available--that would have been more interesting.Disc 4 - Live On The BBCGood ""live"" stuff.  If you've ever heard a ""BBC"" album by any other artist, you know what you're getting here.  Standout tracks include previously unreleased covers of ""The Look Of Love"" & ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" as well as an extended version of ""What More Can I Do"" and an organ-dominated ""She's Not There.""  The disc ends with an interview where Rod & Chris talk about their future plans in music.Again, this is the ultimate release for Zombies fans.  The one & only drawback:  there isn't more! I will gladly make this the 42nd five star review! Everything about this box set is first rate. The first thing I did when I opened the package was to read the 64 page booklet inside. The quality of the booklet, the research, and the writing provides the context needed to understand the Zombie story. After that I listened to all four discs. The quality of the mastering is first rate throughout. Overall, if you only know the Zombies by their three singles, take the leap and buy this box set. You will not be disappointed. Instead, you will be enlightened at how broad their talents were, how convincing they were at both R&B; and Pop, and how the Oddessey & Oracle material was way beyond their time.Not everyone will get this connection, but as I was reading and listening, I was reminded of the Big Star story.#1 Record / Radio CityCertainly the Zombies enjoyed much greater success than Big Star, but both bands were extremely talented next to their peers and ahead of their time. My biggest surprise with the Zombies was how well they covered Soul and R&B; material in their early days -- not something you would imagine with just three big pop singles to their name. Many fans of The Zombies may find it hard to believe that this influential and respected band best known for ""She's Not There"", ""Tell Her No"" and ""Time of the Seasons"" only recorded two full albums and a number of singles before breaking up. ""Zombie Heaven"" assembled by Alec Palao (who lives not too far from my neck of the woods) is a exhaustive collection of the band's two album releases, singles, their legendary ""lost"" album, BBC shows and demos in a deluxe boxed set with an essay, comments on the various songs by band members and excerpts from the band's history pulled from diary information lovingly assembled for this set.Palao working with Nick Robbins has remastered these tracks from the original master tapes and, in some instances, also providing true stereo mixes for some songs for the first time. This is an exceptional set. The sound is also pretty darn good for the set. One could quibble about some of the mastering choices but, on the whole, the albums included here ""Begin Here"" and ""Odyssey and Oracle"" both sound clearer than ever before.The booklet is presented on glossy paper and runs about 68 pages providing insight into the origin of each song from the respective composer. This is just about all the Zombies any fan would want.Highly recommended This box set is great!  The Zombies were one of the few groups, the Beatles and the Beach Boys were the others, who combined wonderful vocal harmonies with excellent songwriting.

This is quite simply the Greatest compilation album ever loosly slapped together with some masking tape and thumbtacks. Forget music trends!

147,337,B0000004FT,"I saw the Cows several times, but one show in particular stands out. It would have been around the time Cunning Stunts was current, or perhaps Peacetika. Shannon wore his usual cowboy hat during the entire show, which was what he pretty much always did. It was coated in enamel spray paint or laquer or something. After finishing the last song in a full set that was probably at least an hour long, he took the hat off to reveal that he'd had a donut sitting on top of his head for the entire performance. He took a bite out of the donut and threw it into the audience as hard as he could, hitting an unfortunate girl right in the face.This is generally regarded as the Cows' best album. Minneapolis' Cows will be looked upon as an outfit that treaded that fine line between brilliance and stupidity. Shannon &amp; Co. disbanded early this decade and if you've never had a chance to see them live, then you missed a great 90's punk band in all of their decadence. Cows are a confrontational, noisey, blusey punk outfit that commanded you to show off your best punk rock dance moves: from the sound of Shannon's frenetic screaming and his stuttering, damaged bugle bursts, to Thor's bluesy deconstructionist riffing; Kevin's impossibly low bass and Norm's galloping thud, Cunning Stunts MADE you move.  Heave Ho's staccato horn blasts coupled along with a menacing groove, Walks Alone's rockabilly, butt-kicking stomp, Down Below's distorted, down-picking squall...one word, Rocks.  A fine primer for these AmRep Heroes. Cows were a genuinely frightening live experience. The first time I saw them was on the tour for this album, in '92 or '93. They just exuded menace, real 1890s frontier nastiness. I mean, they were four guys with guitars in a rock club, not a very scary thing, but still. This is their best and in a weird way their poppiest record, though check out ""Effete and Impudent Snobs"" for a more disorderly garbagey take on the Cows experience. Shannon's trumpet is used to great effect and the moment when ""Heave Ho"" kicks in still makes me want to do David Lee Roth jump kicks around the room.","Alternative Rock,Progressive,Indie Rock,Indie & Lo-Fi,Pop,Rock,American Alternative,Progressive Rock",saw cows several times one show particular stands would around time cunning stunts current perhaps peacetika shannon wore usual cowboy hat entire show pretty much always coated enamel spray paint laquer something finishing last full set probably least hour long took hat reveal hed donut sitting top head entire performance took bite donut threw audience hard could hitting unfortunate girl right face generally regarded cows best minneapolis cows looked upon outfit treaded fine line brilliance stupidity shannon amp co disbanded early decade youve never chance see live missed great punk band decadence cows confrontational noisey blusey punk outfit co saw cows times show stands time cunning cunning stunts stunts current wore usual cowboy cowboy hat hat entire show pretty pretty much coated enamel spray spray paint paint finishing full set probably hour long hat reveal donut sitting head entire performance bite donut threw audience hard hitting unfortunate girl right face generally regarded cows best minneapolis cows looked looked upon outfit treaded fine line brilliance stupidity amp disbanded early decade chance see live missed great punk punk band band decadence cows confrontational noisey punk outfit

152,343,B0000004GW,"One of the wonderful Amphetamine Reptile Record's finest purveyors of sonic melee, The Cows play rock & roll the way it's meant to be played, loud and noisy. With amps cranked up past 11 and songs that threaten to dissolve into chaotic noise orgies at any second, The Cows blistering blend of perverse punk rock is the ideal equation of incompetence and brilliance. Their 7th installment in the war against conventional music, ""Orphan's Tragedy"" continues to carry the band's signature lack of style, but unlike many of their peers, i.e. The Jesus Lizard, Helmet, each ensuing Cows release shows a marked maturity over its predecessors and on Orphan's Tragedy, this growth is best represented by the album's incredible diversity. Able to cruise along at accelerated punk rock tempos or revel in the dirgy grind of metallic experimentalism, The Cows extract an immense amount of creative results from their never ceasing inundation of feedback. Eerie, Avant Garde crawls like ""Pickled Garbage Soup"" and ""Witch Hunt"" are as soothing as they are shocking and the rockabilly tinged ""I'm Both"" as well as the poppy ""Baby Love"" show that even within the confines of their fuzzed out warzone, The Cows still push the boundaries of noise rock far beyond the breaking point. The Cows can therefore not only churn out frenzied chord after chord, but most importantly, they can do it intelligently. Like all Cows albums, Orphan's Tragedy is another fascinating maelstrom of sloppy brilliance that should appeal to most noise rock and grunge fans alike (The Melvins, Mudhoney, The Jesus Lizard); So if you want to hear a CD that'll really make your ears bleed but still make sense when the album ends, Orphan's Tragedy is highly recommended.","Alternative Rock,Progressive,Indie Rock,Indie & Lo-Fi,Pop,Adult Alternative,Rock,American Alternative,Progressive Rock",one wonderful amphetamine reptile records finest purveyors sonic melee cows play rock roll way meant played loud noisy amps cranked past threaten dissolve chaotic noise orgies second cows blistering blend perverse punk rock ideal equation incompetence brilliance th installment war conventional orphans tragedy continues carry bands signature lack style unlike many peers e jesus lizard helmet ensuing cows release shows marked maturity predecessors orphans tragedy growth best represented incredible diversity able cruise along accelerated punk rock tempos revel dirgy grind metallic experimentalism cows extract immense amount creative results never ceasing inundation feedback eerie avant garde crawls like pickled garbage soup witch hunt soothing one wonderful amphetamine amphetamine reptile amphetamine reptile records reptile records purveyors sonic melee cows play rock roll roll way way meant played loud noisy amps cranked past threaten dissolve chaotic noise orgies second cows blistering blend perverse punk punk rock rock ideal equation incompetence brilliance installment war conventional orphans tragedy continues carry bands signature lack style peers jesus lizard helmet ensuing cows release shows marked maturity predecessors orphans tragedy growth best represented incredible diversity able cruise accelerated punk punk rock rock tempos revel dirgy grind metallic experimentalism cows extract immense creative results ceasing inundation feedback eerie avant garde crawls pickled garbage soup witch witch hunt hunt soothing
153,345,B0000004H6,"Posessing one of the most unique guitar sounds, one I have loved since I first heard his work with Chrome, Creed continues to release good sounding discs. Sadly, he is revealing his limitations as a writer, most of his recent works have sounded like rehashes of earlier stuff, making most of his output pretty interchangable. If you own one or two of his releases you are set, unless you are a completist.  By all means, check his stuff out folks, just don't expect a lot of variation or growth between releases. Stunning mid-'90's Helios Creed CD release, one of the better efforts he's ever put out. In my opinion, anyway. Like the way he carries on where Chrome had apparently left off. Tracks here that about had me screaming for more were ""Tele-Vision"", ""Dog Star"", the space rock-like ""First Encounter"" (possibly the best cut on the entire disc), ""Kurt Zombie"" and ""Next Encounter"". Best described as mutated industrial, with a good share of alternative weirdness thrown in. Line-up: Helios Creed - guitar, synthesizer & vocals, Chris McKay - bass and Paul Della Pelle - drums.

154,346,B0000004HC,"AS you can tell by scanning the other reviews of this band, Chokebore has a huge following in Europe. They've been relegated to the underground here in the States, not necessarily out of choice but mostly because their sound is uninviting and lacks the cliched mono-chorded hooks that permeate nearly every punk band doing covers of older tried-and-true classics.Exploring mostly off-key atmospheres layered in melancholy drones of angst, Chokebore spins songs the Pixies would make if the soundtrack engineer accidentally hit the 180-degree phase offset button. And that's a good thing.Stacking upon the negative aural nirvana is frontman Troy Bruno Balthazar's brooding voicebox, which infiltrates the ear canals with alternating marches of haze and delirium. This guy's a pessimist, but hope shows through when he lays down bombastic riffs and cuts with the Kroll brothers, who play bass and lead. Behind the drums is an ever-changing cast that compliment the fuzz and drone with simplistic clarity and consistency. Dale Crover won't be doing any Chokebore sidework anytime soon.I like turning the lights out and reminiscing about scorned women and effervescent relationships. For such occasions, the music is like anchovies on a Caesar salad: not pleasant to hear at first, but once you try it you find out it's not that bad.

155,348,B0000004HK,"After ""Get a Witness"" I was afraid they weren't going to come out with another album...thankfully they proved me wrong.

It is not overproduced like ""Get a Witness"" was (again, IMHO...when you're used to seeing a band live that many times, their first album is apt to be disappointing, not capturing their live energy on disc and the producer being a little over-production-happy, not knowing* their live work well enough).Guzzard is one of those bands where everyone has a symbiotic relationship, they are INCREDIBLE live, and more suited to smaller, personal venues, to replicate their intensity.

157,350,B0000004HZ,"There's nothin' like your first.  Once I heard them I was permanently hooked on punk rock.  I sought them out and saw them live about 5 times back in the day and another 3 or 4 times in the 90's.  This cd contains their 3 7""s (for the uninitiated, vinyl records sometimes called eps that were sometimes singles and other times had a number of songs as you could fit up to 14 minutes on one).  Those records they released are, in my opinion, and I'm a massive punk rock, uh, consumer/enjoyer/punk rock for 29 years, 3 of the finest ever made.  They crackle.  You get the great opportunity on amazon.com to actually listen to about 1/2 the records listed on the site and, fortunately, this is one of them.  Tell me if you've ever heard anything like this?  It's fresh, minamal, sharp and tight.  3 UCLA students who hit a maybe semi geek groove which is too narrowing, still, they weren't leather jacketed GBH fans type guys.  They remained true to who they were and continued to over the decades.  Funny thing is, in person they're rather low key.  But on stage they just tear it up.  Personally, Ack, Ack, Ack, Ack is the finest punk rock song of all time.  When I'm a Bug comes on or I hear them do it live that also just sets me off, punk rock explosion of tune and music and energy delivered with a certain joy and abandon.  The lst 11 songs are from the lst 3 7""s and they have a stripped down feel to them that I've simply never found anywhere else.  I'm always impressed when music still sounds great to me decades later.  I don't sit around and listen to the same musician(s) daily or weekly or monthly or even annually.  But in the ebb and flow of listening, they keep zinging me when I get back to them.  Thank goodness for this collection. It includes some live stuff that's not not up to the same crispness as their 7""s material but that and other unreleased studio songs are still welcome cuz you just don't run across a band like this every day, in fact, there's no one like them and any song I can get from them, I'm happy to hear it.  Great guys too.  Who could ask for more.  chrisbct@hotmail.com Boy, does this disc bring back memories! These guys, dorm-mates of mine at UCLA, got their start at a talent show on the fourth floor of Dykstra Hall in the fall of 1978. They followed my roommate, Fred Velez, who wore a Hawaiian shirt and straw hat and strummed ""Light My Fire"" a la Jose Feliciano. Thus inspired, the Urinals came on in Hawaiian shirts and straw hats, but they played fast and loud. John Jones had a threatening edge to his voice, Kjehl Johansen beat on his axe like he wanted to break it, and Kevin Barrett played a drum kit that looked as if it had once belonged to a 10-year-old boy.On Halloween, Vitus Matare of the band ""The Last"" caught their act at another dorm show and offered to record an EP for them. This session resulted in the first of three seven-inch records released in 1979 and 1980, which I still have and treasure and which you now can hear and appreciate on this collection. The sound was crude at the beginning, but the songs were perfect in their snarling, frenetic, two-minute-max minimalism. My favorite track from the first four-song release is ""Dead Flowers,"" clearly influenced by surf music, while ""Last Days of Man on Earth"" on the flip side is a protest song and has nothing to do with apocalyptic science fiction.The second EP was a huge leap ahead both in audio quality and songwriting. It features four classics: a bad acid trip into a ""Black Hole"" and another protest on ""I'm White and Middle Class."" Side B is even better: the hilarious ""I'm a Bug,"" which brings to mind Jonathan Richman, and what may be the Urinals' most-requested and most-covered song, ""Ack Ack Ack Ack."" The third record has ""Sex"" on the A side, a great single, but I like the other side, ""Go Away Girl,"" even more. It starts with the gentlest of intros and suddenly breaks into one of the most unhinged vocals John has ever recorded.The band changed its name to 100 Flowers (thank you, Chairman Mao) and produced two more EPs and an LP between 1982 and 1984, including such fine songs as ""I Hate"" and ""She's a Drone,"" both of which are included on this CD. The studio recordings are rounded out by live gigs at two Los Angeles clubs in 1980 and 1981, wrapping up with a crazy cover of the Jetson's Theme (just to show the boys didn't take themselves too seriously). There are even a couple of ragged tracks I myself taped on a cassette recorder at Dykstra Hall in 1978: ""Don't Make Me Kill Again"" and ""You Piss Me Off.""The group took a long hiatus, but John and Kevin reformed the band under its original name in 1996 and continue ""struggling with their instruments"" today. Yet these early tracks have an anarchic rawness, a fierce vitality, and a quirky cleverness that's hard to beat. Bring on your favorite punk performances; the Urinals' work, well-respected among rock cognoscente, will stand proudly in their company.

This is not titd's heaviest release but it is one their best. This album contains some great music. Highlights: kai piranha, bugs death march, black iron prison, and ripped off. Three years ago I gave this album a bad review. At the time I was so hooked on ""Temple of the Morning Star"" and ""In the Eyes of God"" that I now admit I didn't give this CD enough of a chance. In the time since then, this album has grown on me more than any other TITD release.It is even less conventional than their other stuff (which is saying a lot), but that makes it even more special. It's not quite as heavy, but among metal it is totally unique. You won't find another album quite like this, as far as songwriting, odd instrumentation, and the sick feeling of internalized anger and hopelessness that Steve Austin conveys. These songs combine power, honest emotion, rage, deprevity, isolation and dementia like few things I've ever heard. Specifically: ""Marked"", ""Realization"", ""Black Iron Prison"", ""Mountain People"", and my personal highlight, the amazing ""Ripped Off"".I owe Steve an apology on this one.

159,354,B0000004IJ,"How best to describe this CD?  Liquid emotion.  What's so amazing about Chokebore is that every song is written in a way in which anybody can relate to.  The lyrics and music are full of such emotion that at times they make you feel as if the songs were written for you, about you.  The singer, Troy Balthazar, has the gift of making depression enjoyable.  This CD is great to listen to after going through a break-up or just having a bad day.  The sadness in the music allows the listener to empathize with the lyrics and yet be uplifted by them.  Beautiful music that allows itself to be taken in by you and leaves you wanting more.  Get this CD, you will not regret it. I can only agree with what previous two ppl said about this album.

161,356,B0000004IS,"I must say that I wanted very badly to like this band. The problem was, despite managing at least to like one song on the albun Spare Parts, I got the distinct Impression that this band was yet another young, spoiled white pretty boy/girl band who missed the mark they set for themselves by being derivative and unoriginal. Their Robo-act may initially appeal to New Wave, or Electronic Freaks, but ultimately, not the real ones like myself. The problem with this band is the same as many 90's bands, where talent, vision and imagination are entirely forgone for Looks and Hype alone. The Creative Fruit of which is always listless and dull... The Creators of this music did little to convince me they really were Space Age Machines. Instead, all I was shown was what I have seen before, a bunch of Yuppie Droids posing as Artists with no message, no purpose and no meaning other than the desire to be adored for a sleekness or a cuteness that quickly wears thin. I found myself wanting to listen to Kraftwerk afterwards, the real masters of this style of music, for Servotron left me feeling empty, aching and unsatisfied. They seem to be still taking lessons from Kraftwerk. In my opinion, they are poor students. This band seems more like a juvenille B52's, and one without a clue... WAIT! STOP! Do Not Exit! Unless you buy this CD. Servotron remixes with the club atmosphere in mind are here on this collection of audio mind control units designed to subvert the human race.

As usual songs about beer,sex,beer,women,beer all done with the 'Psychos great Aussie sense of humour. LEGENDS!!! Looks to be the band's sixth CD. Cosmic Psychos is an Australian band - best described as high-decibel powerful-charged rock & roll. Have barely ever heard of them until fairly recent. I won't lie - what partially drew my attention to this CD was the three vivacious woman on it's cover. Tracks here that I definitely enjoyed the most were the awesome ""Can't Keep A Good Man Down"", the ass-kicking (yet, familiar-sounding) ""Breathless"", the punk-like ""Creepin'"", the rocking ""Super Vixen"" (nice lyrics), ""Crow"" and ""Chainsaw"". Line-up: Peter Jones - guitar & vocals, Ross Knight - bass & vocals and Bill Walsh - drums & vocals. Recommended for fans of the Stooges, Chrome, MC 5, the Flamin' Groovies and maybe Wolfmother. Excellent high power rock once again from this Australian trio.  One of  the best bands around in my opinion and this album just reinforces that.  A  must have for anybody who is tired of the same old politically correct  stuff.

163,360,B0000004NF,"This album contains some of the phattest lyrics I have ever heard by Ghetto Mafia, it is also one of my favorites.  I always said that nobody could stop Ghetto Mafia's Blues Rap combination and my point is proven with  every album they bring out. Ghetto Mafia's third album, Straight From The Dec, is a display of Nino and Wicked's grind for nationwide success.  The album's spotlight, ""For The Good Times (Straight From The Dec)"", with a blues sample and the Mafia stop and go flow is an instant eye opener.  They also take a Jamican, Reggae-like approach with a heavy bassline on ""Who Wanna Test"".  Hearing the name 'Wicked' being yelled out almost works as a gimmick.  The duo tag team on a verse for the gangster funk ""I Can Feel It"" and could have been used throught the song.  Straight From The Dec starts off with and maintains it's high expectations from the opener ""In Da Paint"".  The Mafia talk about their hustling and struggles being in the 'trap' as done on ""Fool I Got Ya "" and many other subjects within this lp.  Their lyrics are direct and simple with a southern slang that are strong enough to keep your attention. I saw the video for the single &quot;For the good times&quot; and i liked it so i thought i would pick it up.This cd is great.Every song on here is tight and makes you want to play it over and over.This group might not be a  big name around the country but you cant beat this cd!

164,361,B0000004QI,"The first time I heard Kathy Tracoli, I instantly felt joy in my own soul as the words of each song spoke to me.  I listen to this CD over and over in my car and feel the presence of God right there with me!  She has become  my favorite Christian artist not only because of her music, but because her  love for Christ, through her music, is genuine and refreshing.  Her music  lifts my spirits and blesses me every time I hear her sing! This recording is a work that I can listen to several times a day without  getting tired of it.  I hear the music with my ears, but I feel it in my  hear as I'm reminded how true God is to us and how much he loves  us.Kathy Troccoli's devotional book &quot;My Life is in Your Hands&quot;  is also a tremenduous work.  Anyone who is having a hard time or just needs  to be reminded of the faithfulness of God needs to get this book. Whenever I hear Kathy Troccoli sing, I feel blessed -- not only does she sing her heart to God, but sometimes I feel she reaches him for me too. If you ever read her devotional, My Life Is In Your Hands, you can relate to a single woman longing to be close to the One who loves her most... and with the songs on this CD (as all her others) she reaches out to Him. Facing some tough times of my own, I especially relate to How Would I Know? and Help Me God. These songs really made me appreciate 'the battles' -- and the victory, and feeling His nearness through it all. I highly recommend this!! This is a must-have CD for your contemporary Christian music collection. If there is an album that I could call 'divinely inspired,' then this is one of them. It is truly uplifting, for those times when things get a little too much to bear. The music plays like scripture in song. As a Kathy Troccoli fan, she definitly know how to touch one heart and soul and with love and mercy, this album does not dissapoint. From the upbeat tempos of ""love one another"" and ""call out to me"" from the heartfelt songs of ""water into wine"" and a ""baby's prayer"", the songs in this album will definitly be pleasing to fans of all ages.","Pop & Contemporary,Adult Contemporary,Christian,Pop",first time heard kathy tracoli instantly felt joy soul words spoke listen cd car feel presence god right become favorite christian artist love christ genuine refreshing lifts spirits blesses every time hear sing recording work listen several times day without getting tired hear ears feel hear im reminded true god us much loves us kathy troccolis devotional book quot life hands quot also tremenduous work anyone hard time needs reminded faithfulness god needs get book whenever hear kathy troccoli sing feel blessed sing heart god sometimes feel reaches ever read first time time heard kathy instantly felt joy soul words spoke listen cd car feel presence god right favorite christian artist love christ genuine refreshing lifts spirits blesses time hear sing recording work listen times day tired hear ears feel hear im reminded true god loves devotional devotional book book quot life life hands hands quot work hard hard time time needs reminded faithfulness god needs book hear kathy kathy troccoli troccoli sing feel blessed sing heart god feel reaches read
165,362,B0000004QK,"Quite literally the most fun you'll have rocking out. Snarky humor and smoking guitar riffs abound here. Let's face it, it doesn't get better than that! Don't shy away from this album because it'll keep you smiling, and don't make that sound like it's some boy band pop crap. An album can still rock out like no other while still being fun and happy. ok... so i guess you'd call this band pop; but pop with an edge. It is pop but it's still heavy. Hard to explain if you haven't heard it, and that's why you need to. It is also creative, making the melodies intriguing so that it keeps your interest. It's 45 minutes of pure joy, so go check out the guitar heavy pop band that's sweeping the nations with their Sma-a-sh hits! don't shy away from this album simply because it has ""CHRISTIAN"" emblazoned on it's proverbial forehead. because this album is not really a ""christian"" album. sure, some elements of the band's belief's comeout here and there, but it's not a beat-you-over-the-head-sinner type feel it's more of a look-this-is-what-i'm-in-to-sweet-deal-let's-have-fun sort of thing.having said that, steer far away from any albums prior to this. they're worthless. Ian's a great lyricist...and whoever wrote the guitar parts really shines through with some creative stuff.  This one is a top notch album that challenges a Christian's comfort zone.&quot;La La Land&quot; anyone? All Star United's self-titled debut is just plain F-U-N. The album is a bit of a paradox, providing mature, guitar-centric, bubble-gum pop music that somehow comes off as a serious contender without any pretense of taking itself seriously, like the President giving a speech on world economics in his undroos or fine dining at the Queen's estate eating lobster and Cocoa Puffs.The use of the term ""pop"" music should be clarified so as to not be compared to the contrived plastic of boy bands or young girl icons usually associated with the term. In fact, while the album represents the debut of their incarnation as All Star United, the sum of the band members represents decades of experience.Outside of his two album solo career, Ian Eskelin on lead vocals has had guitar, keyboard, or other collaboration history with no less than 10 previous bands, including the well known Newsboys and Code of Ethics. Patrick, the guitarist, also shared axe duties for the well-known synth act The Echoing Green. Christian Crowe backed Ian up on drums during his solo career, and Gary rounds out the act on bass. While Ian wrote most of the tracks on the tail end of his solo career, their combined efforts has brought a success to a whole new level above anything seen by them individually. In the year of its release, the album produced many rankings in the top 5 and a couple number one hits.The band does an excellent job of poking fun at the industry it has so much experience with. `Smash Hit' takes a jab directly at the packaging of this whole Jesus thing, shemlessly referencing overpriced merchandise and image exploitation of Christianity. It even gets personal with my personal favorite, `La La Land', setting the stage from the start with reference to those with their Jesus bumper stickers in the hopes that it will somehow save them from that speeding ticket.The appeal of the album lies in the fact that this style of honest / sarcastic exposure is usually only found in more angst-ridden genres. The songs cover the spectrum of emotions and do touch on a serious side, from relationships with others to a relationship with God. It is kept light-hearted throughout the album, though, right down to Ian's aunt singing into a playschool recorder hidden on the end of the last track.You will be hard pressed to find a better pop-album on the market. Outstanding vocals, guitars, synth, and the occasional organ backdrop make for fun ride starting in La La Land and ending with a Lullaby.- Chad- The Edge On-Line I first saw ASU on tour in '96 I think, and from the first song I was captivated.  Never had I seen a better show from a Christian band.  Needless to say, as soon as it came out I bought this album, and now five years later, I still can't get enough of it.  I very highly reccommend it to anyone Christian or not who loves tounge-in-cheek pop music.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Rock & Alternative,Pop",quite literally fun youll rocking snarky humor smoking guitar riffs abound lets face doesnt get better dont shy away itll keep smiling dont make sound like boy band pop crap still rock like still fun happy ok guess youd call band pop pop edge pop still heavy hard explain havent heard thats need also creative making melodies intriguing keeps interest minutes pure joy go check guitar heavy pop band thats sweeping nations sma sh hits dont shy away simply christian emblazoned proverbial forehead really christian sure elements bands beliefs comeout beat head sinner type feel look im quite literally fun rocking snarky humor smoking guitar guitar riffs riffs abound lets face get better better shy away keep smiling make sound sound boy boy band band pop crap rock fun happy guess band pop pop pop pop edge pop heavy hard explain heard need creative melodies intriguing keeps interest minutes pure joy check guitar heavy heavy pop pop pop band band sweeping nations sh hits shy away simply christian emblazoned proverbial forehead really christian sure elements bands beliefs beat head sinner type feel look
166,364,B0000004QS,"It's different than most of their stuff.  It's harder and edgier, and I like it that way.  They're a great Christian group. I can agree with a lot of what has been said here.  This is a great album,  in fact it is the first album I purchased by a Christian band.  I have  been a huge 3D fan since.  However I don't think that secular music  contains evil,  per se.  Satan is only where you allow him to be.  I find  many of Creed's lyrics spiritually uplifting.  Granted they are not 100%  glorify God driven,  but it isn't fair for anyone to pass judgement on the  band or it's members.  God can use anyone at anytime to fulfill any  purpose.  The lyrics of a Creed song may just as well lead someone to Jesus  as easily as the lyrics of a Third Day song.I love this band (Third  Day),  and they're music,  more importantly I love the message that it  brings.  And from what I understand,  these guys walk the walk.  If you  ever get the chance I recommend catching a live 3D show.GOD Bless This was the last Third Day album I bought because I had heard it was ""hard rock"" and the least popular of their albums. On the first listen, I was unsure what I thought. However, it has quickly become my favorite Third Day album. It has two duds on it that get monotonous - ""I Deserve"", and ""My Hope is in You"". ""Who I Am"" is a gorgeous song until the chorus, which drives me crazy. And ""Gomer's Song"" is OK but not their best. But the rest of the album is incredible, hence a 5-star rating. I skip the ones I don't like and revel in the rest of it. Yes, it is harder rock that their other albums. They really rock in this one, but it's not just noise. It is very creative music with very thought-provoking words that stick with you. If Mac Powell's voice stirs you all up inside, then you've got to get this album, because he plays it to its limits in this one. It took me awhile to warm up to Third Day.  Even though I already owned this CD and the debut CD, it was not until I had burned holes in &quot;Time&quot; on my CD player that I really came to appreciate this band and their music.  In all honesty, I did not like this album or its sound for long time.  It took a couple of years, but now I love it!Die-hard Third Day fans already know that this CD departs greatly from the debut project by featuring a much edgier and darker rock sound.  My first exposure to this CD came from hearing &quot;Alien&quot; on the radio.  Later cuts that got airplay include &quot;Peace,&quot; &quot;You Make Me Mad,&quot; and &quot;Have Mercy.&quot;  Although not as popular with the radio exec's in my part of the USA, &quot;My Hope is You,&quot; &quot;Who I Am,&quot; and &quot;How's Your Head&quot; also deserve credit.  In fact, suffice it to say that all the songs on this CD stand strong on their own merits.When you plug this album into your CD player, just let it play through without skipping ahead to your favorite songs.  I hope you find yourself enjoying this 13 song effort as much as I do.  It is okay to listen through several times before deciding later how much you like it (that's what I did!).  Oh, wait a little while after &quot;Your Love Endures&quot; ends because a hidden track featuring a version of the chorus from &quot;Who I Am&quot; finishes the CD. I hate to disagree with the majority but this is not a good CD.I consider myself a fan of Third Day but I was woefully disappointed with Conspiracy.  I find the music to be terribly forced and contrived (the guitar intro to Peace sounds like a highschool band's throw-away riff) and the lyrics are neither profound nor memorable (some, such as those in You Make Me Mad, are downright embarassing).  I can appreciate that artists like to grow and cover new ground but this CD was a step backward. The few high points for me are I Deserve, Who I Am, Peace (despite the mind-numbingly mediocre guitar riff), and Your Love Endures.I bought this CD only after reading the abundance of good reviews here and now feel it is my duty to warn others.  If you want to try Third Day for the first time, please try their debut or Time before you try this one.  I would also encourage Third Day fans to listen to Conspiracy before buying it, even if you like their other stuff.  This one doesn't measure up. Each and every song on this album just has to be listened to over and over again.  Mac Powell's &quot;Eddie Vedder-like&quot; voice and Thirdday's Spirit of God filled lyrics truly touch the soul.  I especially liked the  song My hope is in you, although I loved them all!! The Christian scene's ultimate southern-fried rockers take a turn for the grungier on &quot;Conspiracy No. 5&quot;.  Third Day change up their sound, trading their southern-rock-based stylings for something that sounds like it could be out of Seattle.  Don't get me wrong, though; this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  These guys know how to rock out.  Tracks like &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Mad&quot; got me slapping my steering wheel along with the beat.  As much of a departure as this one is, though, it's nice to hear these guys haven't lost their roots.  The gospel-flavored stomp &quot;Have Mercy&quot; will make you say &quot;Now THAT'S the Third Day I know and love!&quot;  They haven't forgotten how to get their praise on, either; &quot;My Hope Is You&quot; is evidence enough of that.  This album was and still is a smash, and though some Third Day fans might frown upon the change, I think that the more you listen, the more it'll grow on you.  Sometimes change can be a good thing. (Besides, it's not like it was permanent.) My veins pump with a love for hard rock..the problem is that there are so very few bands that praise, while raising the roof with well written songs and great, full sound.  This is one awesome album, through and through.  There are just not enough Christian bands out there that really let it rip!  There are many &quot;scream-o&quot; and &quot;nu-metal&quot; so called Christian bands, but nothing like Third Day.  These guys are annointed, and play great music.  I prefer this album over any of the other Third Day albums, because of its harder edge and generous use of distortion; yet there are a few slower praise songs that fit perfectly!  You can't help but tap your foot to every song; it is GREAT driving music!  It is so cool to be able to sing lyrics with praise to our Creator and Savior....more.....more! The music is OK. I definitely like their newer stuff better.  I bought this one because I read somewhere that it sounded like Pearl Jam. Mac Powell sounds a lot like Vedder but the music is different. Its good for hardcore Third Day collectors. This is a truly masterful and anointed CD!. The lyrical content speaks a strong message and the music is original and enjoyable listening. Furthermore, having seen Third Day in concert, I commend them in that more  than performing, they worship the Lord and bring the audience along with  them into an exhilirating experience with God. It is one thing to be  talented, which they are, but to be anointed of the Lord is a true blessing  to both the band and all who listen. Solid rock album from a great band. This is probably the heaviest album in the groups catalog Not their greatest CD, but it's still Third Day so a must have for fans.  Sound quality isn't the greatest on this disc. A great album overall. Sounds like Hootie with more of an edge to it. Some very memorable songs...esp. Homers Theme. This is a great cd to buy. I give it 2 thumbs up! If you've never heard Third Day before you are missing a treat.  If you like stuff like Pearl Jam and Hootey and the Blowfish, I think you'll enjoy this music.  I own the three cd's they have put out and conspiracy #5 is  probably my favorite.  Keep in mind, this is a Christian group, some of the  lyrics may not be appropriate for you.  The words may convict your heart  and soul.  The quality of the music is as good, if not better, than most  secular rock music.  Christian or not, if you like rock music, you'll enjoy  this. i just want to tell all of you that third day is great, but i want to warn you of bands like creed.  if you are a christian and live for God, do not listen to them, listen to bands like third day who are doing God's work.  creed is generational, out there for themselves,not for Jesus.  thankyou Third Day cranks it up on Conspiracy #5.  Songs like Peace, Have Mercy, and Give Me A Reason reveal Third Day's heavier side, but still leave room for lighter songs like My Hope Is You and Your Love Endures.  The whole album is awesome, but the last three songs, Give Me A Reason, Gomer's Theme, and Your Love Endures steal the spotlight. Each one is good in it's own way. Give Me A Reason being a solid rocker, Gomer's Theme with it's Pearl Jamish sound and cool solo at the end, and Your Love Endures, a quiet heart-felt ballad at the end. Conspiracy #5 five is a must have, only second to Time, full of Hard-edged songs, but diverse enough to allow for awesome ballads. I love every other CD done by Third Day.  This one just did not stand up to what I have come to expect from this group. Third day's best, also the best CD I have ever heard! Third Day stays away from the dreaded sophmore slump in this disc.  It wasn't as commercially sucessful as their debut album I feel mainly because they've changed their music style.  Their debut album was more southern rock while this disc has a more grung-ish feel.  You make me mad is a great rock tune that is sure to impress.  As usual the lyrics are great making overall appeal of the album top notch.  For those who are familiar with Third Day's southern rock style this may take you a listen or two to get used to the sound but I think you'll like it. I have listened to this album and I would personally recommend any other album by Third Day before I would recommend this one. I would also like to respond to the comments about Creed. I find it very dishartening that anyone would compare these two bands. Third Day is a band that creates music the way it was intended by God, to glorify Him and His name. I have seen an interview with Creed and they dont claim the name of Jesus in anyway. I am not being judgmental, that is fact. I just wanted to clear up any confusion that was stated by other reviewers. By ""the Obvious"" I mean the bare fact that Sam Taylor produced this album, under the banner of his ""Wilde Silas"" production company.  Sam Taylor was the amazing producer of the early Kings-X albums, and is the reason for that extra-crispy hard rock (almost metal)guitar sound. Whatever you (or we, as Christians) may think of the philosophical turn made by Kings-X bass player, they had a unique sound that broke open the barriers between the traditional ""metal"" sound, and the growing alternative sound.All that to say that Sam adds that same amazing technique to this 2nd, and very unique Third Day album. As a believer in Jesus, I rejoice in the success and influence of every Third Day release, but from a strictly musical perspective, this one stand miles above the rest.  After ""Conspiracy #5"" got the attention of my ears and my mind, in subsequent release, Third Day returned to their trademark ""southern-rock"" sound, which--for me--was a disappointment.  Now I realize that Third Day probably never thought the sound of this 2nd release was who they really were, and that their return to the southern sound was deliberate.  That's OK;  they need to play what they like and what they feel.BUT:  I can't help thinking that their musical approach could have benefitted greatly if they had kept more of the ""Wilde Silas"" production style in their sound. For me, this is the only Third Day CD to which I keep coming back, and when I hear the later live versions of these particular songs, I keep thinking that something is missing, and I wish the band would have kept it.Hopefully that's a fair review of this masterpiece, and some food for thought about being open to other musical influences than just our ""comfort zone."" In 1997, Third Day followed up their self-titled debut with &quot;Conspiracy No.5.&quot; &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; produced by Sam Taylor (the man who discovered, managed & produced King's X and Galactic Cowboys),maintains some of the band's Southern Rock sound they had become known for (&quot;Have Mercy&quot;), but also ventures into other musical territories like grunge and alt-rock. Some have criticized 3D for trying to sound like Pearl Jam on this album, but I for one applaud them for trying to do something different. My overall favorite song is &quot;Gomer's Theme,&quot; taken from the Old Testament story of Gomer, the unfaithful wife of the prophet Hosea (Hosea 1-3) and the unconditional love shown by her husband. Other noteworthy tracks include &quot;You Make Me Mad,&quot; &quot;Alien,&quot; &quot;Have Mercy,&quot; &quot;My Hope is You&quot; & &quot;Your Love Endures.&quot; &quot;Conspiracy No. 5&quot; is a great album, and an important part of the history of one of Christian music's greatest bands. Obviously, Third Day are very gifted, but I found that too many of the songs became tiresome to listen to. Especially &quot;Make Me Mad.&quot; I'll occasionally pull the CD out and give it a whirl but I find myself skipping plenty of tracks. This CD just doesn't work for me due to its sameness. I enjoyed the &quot;Offerings&quot; CD though. I was blown away by this CD. Even though it's their second release, I got this one first after I heard a cut from it on the WOW compilation CD. I was not disappointed. The sound, the vocals and the lyrics are awesome. If  you've heard songs like &quot;I've Always Loved You&quot; on the radio and  thought the band sounded good, you won't be disappointed when you start to  pick up all of the CDs by Third Day. Not a dud in the bunch. Jack Joseph Puig, who also mixed Tonic's Lemon album, is a pure genius.  Listen to this on headphones and you'll know what I mean.  This album is the best Christian rock disc ever produced.  Even athiests would appreciate these amazing sounds.  The album theme is also very thought-provoking.  This album is by far Third Day's best and is a timeless classic. Jack Joseph Puig, who also mixed Tonic's Lemon Parade album, is a pure genius.  Listen to this on headphones and you'll know what I mean.  This album is the best Christian rock disc ever produced.  Even athiests would appreciate these amazing sounds.  The album theme is also very thought-provoking.  This album is by far Third Day's best and is a timeless classic. I love Third Day!  This downloaded with no problems and I can listen from my computer, phone & Kindle!!!!  Very pleased! I love this CD. I found it completely out of character for a Third Day CD, which is part of it's appeal. Excellent, raw, grinding, well written lyrically and musically. Guitar work is stellar. This is still one of my favorites when working out after a crappy day. Grinding and inspirational. Not your typical ""Christian Rock"" album. A must have. If you like bubble gum, STAY OUT! This is music that moves you emotionally. It makes you want to move physically. And if it does not challenge you spiritually, you are either ready to join Enoch and Elija or  very hard hearted. If you are a rock and roll fan, the music will remind  you of what music can be when it is done for pleasure rather than cash.  If  you are a committed Christian, it will remind you of just how much work you  have yet to do.

167,365,B0000004R6,"What an Awsome, Inspiring, Wonderful CD. I absolutely believe that Smitty is one of the most gifted Christian Artists. This CD absolutely proves beyond a shadow of any doubt his excellence in this genre.  If you buy only one Christmas CD, This is the one to buy.  It isn't exactly what you expect, Chorus, Orchestra, guests (ie. Amy Grant) etc.  Truely one of the best. I heard this on the radio three years before I was able to find it-I did not know who did the music. Now I play it even when it is not the Christmas season. The lyrics help to capture the joy of the Season without necessarily totally losing that traditional sound which those of us who love old school Christmas carols grew up with.In summary,Michael W Smith's voice and the choir he uses blend well together to create a most amazing sound that captures the story of Christmas.AF If you love holiday music, you must have this in your holiday library! I begin listening to it in October, to get me focused on the holiday season.I work in the retail shipping industry, Christmas is our busiest time of year, so I depend on this music to ""soothe"" me! I have had this on audio cassette, wore it out, and then on CD. My absolute, all time favorite Christmas CD! I own this and I got it for a friend. This is beautiful music and it does help you think about when Jesus was born and it gives you this feeling of wonder and mystery. This CD is a classic, a must-have.  Michael W. Smith is an amazing songwriter and musical craftsman.  This is destined to become one of those Christmas CD's that I will play over and over and over. Michael W. Smith's latest Christmas album brings great warmth, variety &amp; fun for the holidays.Not quite the groundbreaking album that his first Christmas album was...but great nonetheless.  Definitely will get you  into the Christmas spirit.  The Boys Choir makes for a definite  &quot;feel&quot; of the holidays! This is my favorite Christmas album, I have worn out at least 4 cd's through the years. I love giving it as a gift because the songs are so awesome. I was first drawn to Michael W.'s remake of Angels We Have Heard On High, titled Gloria, but the entire album is so full of praise! Michael W. Smith is such an awesome Christian songwriter and performer. Love his work! I have been listening to this album every Christmas season for years and years, and I never get tired of it. When it gets to ""All is Well"", I still get goosebumps every time. ""Gloria"", ""Overture"", and ""Christ the Messiah"" are just a few of the songs on this album that to me are Christmas classics. The full orchestra, boys' choir, and his piano and vocals combine for an amazing Christmas album that, more than any other I have heard, captures the real meaning behind this over-commercialized holiday. Trust me - don't be scared off because it's old and the cover art isn't modern. The content is blow-your-socks-off amazing. with his first seasonal effort smith gives us absolute perfection - there isn't a weak one in the bunch, and smith's album is seamless and flows beautifully.  so many great moments, the best of which i would have to  think is &quot;all is well,&quot; which still remains my personal favorite  of smith's!  this is THE ONE that is in the CD player when Christmas rolls  around, and it certainly has many memories attached with it!  nice work,  smitty!  bravado! Beautiful!!! Glorious!!! Awsome!!! Heavenly!!!I even listen to it when it isn't Christmas.Buy it for yourself &amp; your friends &amp; family, you'll be so happy you did. I love the mix of traditional Christmas with new and so-very-well-done pieces. Michael W. Smith is a master at this. This CD stands out in my mind as one of the best of Michael W. Smith's career, and one of my personal favorites. From the opening notes of &quot;Overture/O Come All Ye Faithful&quot; to the closing notes of &quot;Silent Night,&quot; this is a musicaal masterpiece. Two of my favorites on here are &quot;No Eye Had Seen&quot; (a beautiful duet with Amy Grant), and &quot;Gloria&quot; (Michael's version of &quot;Angels We Have Heard On High.) If you don't already have this, I definitely recommend getting it. This is one of the most beautiful Christmas albums you'll ever buy.  Even though Michael W. Smith is primarily known for his Christian pop/rock music, and even though this album was released way back in 1989, the music is just as timeless as if it was written and recorded this morning.Lending their writing talents to a few of the songs are such names as Amy Grant, Gloria Gaither, and Wayne Kirkpatrick (who wrote &quot;Never Been Unloved&quot; from the CD, LIVE THE LIFE).Woven together in this CD is a wonderful mixture of piano solos, adult choirs, boys choirs (most memorably on the song, Lux Venit [the light has come]), and orchestra.I would have liked the CD more had it contained a little more traditional music.  But, all-in-all, this is still a standard-setting Christmas album. nice Christmas CD from Micheal. Allot of Orginal Christmas songssung by gospel biggest artist. This album may be 12 years old, but it is without question, my all time favorite when it comes to Christmas CDs. What first impressed me about it, is that it's not all the same songs you hear on everybody else's Christmas albums. These songs are so unique, so beautifuly arranged, and classic Michael W. Smith! I saw Smitty in concert tonight with the Nashville Symphony and was reminded once again, what a gifted, incredible musician he is! He played several songs from this CD backed by the full orchestra along with his own band - AWESOME! I love this CD so much, I play it year round and never tire of it. A must have for any Christmas CD library! I have really enjoyed this Christmas recording...very unusual and yet very familiar, too.  The orchestrations are just the best.  It has become a favorite of our family. Love this CD even back in college when I first heard it.  recommend it for any family. beautiful boys' choir. The BEST music! I listen to it all the time; just not during Christmas. The message is timeless. I'm Michael W. Smith's newest and biggest fan!! I just found out about his music when I attended a Christmas tree decorating party in early December 2013. I couldn't wait to get home so I could order EVERY ONE of his Christmas CD's!! I LOVE them all! The music is inspiring and breathtakingly beautiful. This is what Christmas is all about. When I was a kid, my mother played The Harry Simeone Chorale and The Robert Shaw Chorale. That was the music that defined Christmas when I was growing up and I still love it to this day. Now Michael W. Smith's music will define Christmas for my kids and grandkids. We're now into January and I'm still listening! An excellent CD that captures the feeling of adoration that should be present during every Christmas season. Very estimulating arrangements make of this album one of fresh celebration that you will cherish for years to come. If you're looking for the obvious, you won't find it here (rudolph, chestnuts, let it snow - thank God!) but you will certainly be propelled into a reflective, delectably worshipful time... much like Christmas should always be! What Michael W. Smith captures on this C.D.is angelic! This by far has become my favorite Christmas alblum of all time. Jesus is the reason for the season, and yes this C.D.is very spiritual.So, if you've heard  &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot;one time too many,and you're looking for music  that will inspire and refresh this one's for you. Michael is joined by The  American Boys Choir School,The Nashville Festival Orchestra as well as his  longtime friend Amy Grant. My favorite cut is &quot;All is Well&quot;a solo  by Nathan Wadley of The Boys Choir.One of the most beautiful songs I've  ever listened to. This C.D. is a remarkable work of art! All of the reviews here speak for themselves.  If you want to hear the most magical, majestic, and utterly beautiful Christmas album ever produced, pick this up.  This music is entirely unlike MWS's radio/pop stuff; it is instead almost entirely orchestral/choral in nature.  The man really can compose! Smith's recording will warm up many a holiday season and bring chills to your spine. Contains the perennial classics ""No Eye Had Seen,"" ""All Is Well,"" and ""Gloria"" (all original MWS compositions). The price of the CD is worth just ONE of these.But MWS is much more of an artist than that. His concept was treating the album as a unity, as is evidenced in the opener, ""Overture,"" which, like a great score to a musical film or stage show, synthesizes the major melodic themes from across the entire album as way of a ""overview"" of what is to come.Each track on this album compliments the others. ""Lux Venit,"" featuring a boys choir, is almost the introduction of characters in a good drama. ""Anthem for Christmas"" follows, which raises the ""dramatic"" action to end the ""first act."" ""Act II"" opens with the 4th track, ""First Snowfall,"" an instrumental that allows the listener to settle once again. But ""Christ the Messiah"" steps up the action once again. So when ""No Eye Had Seen"" follows, the heart has been properly prepared to receive the ""awe-inspiring"" mood MWS so aptly sets and continues with the simple yet even more reverent and mood-provoking ""All Is Well.""There are several more songs that build to the ""dramatic climax"" of this work:  ""Gloria.""  Here MWS favors a less-orchestrated execution, a much-interesting choice that lends an ""understatement"" to ""Gloria's"" glorious arrangement. I have personally performed ""Gloria"" as part of a major choir and full orchestra. ""Gloria"" is so well-crafted that when expanded to this level of arrangement, it not only held its own but nearly ""stole the show.""Oh, and ignore that this recording is from 1989. Meaningless. After the 4th or 5th listening, when the style and spirit of the work begins to ""sink in,"" you'll realize that time has no bearing on either its composition or production value.What to say? Simple. Buy this CD. No-brainer. I bought this CD years ago and still enjoy listening to it a Christmas time.  It has a number of traditional songs and is very instrumental thoughout (don't worry, you hear lots of Michael too).  The only critism I have is that at times the CD can get either really loud or really quiet so I find myself playing with the volume as I listen.  Its a great CD and I would recommend it to everyone! Great Christmas album. Also highly recommend his instrumental album Freedom. It's one of my all-time favorite recordings. I've listened to a lot Christmas music this year, this cd is still one the finest Christmas albums ever made. Michael's unique way of blending many different genres of music. Hauntingly beautiful with the rich orchestrations from Ronn Huff.Released in 1989 you would never know it, sounds almost timeless. If Christmas music has a feel this is it. This cd creates the perfect atmosphere to enjoy the Christmas season. Michael a master of blending and reinventing music to bring something new. I also appreciate the way he gives Christmas music profound reverence and respect. Tops most Christmas releases because of Michael's passion for music,giving it that Christmas feeling and epic sound.""Gloria"" and the beautiful ""All Is Well"" might be some two of the best Christmas songs ever. I find myself enjoying this cd more each year.Michael has captured the Christmas spirit with all of his Christmas titles.  I've been on a buying spree of Christmas music and this cd is still my favorite. It you don't know He has another cd called ""Christmastime"".Congratulations Michael on making a modern tradition for Christmas. Please!! make this in DVD-A format!! It seems the general consensus on Christmas music is that it's fun to hear at the start of the season, but quickly becomes an annoyance towards the end of it; the main complaint being how many times can you hear the same song preformed by different artists? It is a rare occasion when an entire album of Christmas music can not only be a refreshing and welcome alternative to endless clones of holiday songs, but inspires listeners to play it beyond the Christmas season. Michael W. Smith's ""Christmas""  album does just that.A star of the contemporary christian music scene, Smith has managed to blindside those familiar with his hooky choruses and average lyrical content with stunning arrangements of glistening musicianship, beautiful vocalization, and lyrical poetry. Indeed, the album does feature renditions of perennial favorites like ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" and ""Silent Night,"" but these versions sound as new and fresh as the day they were first performed. The real treats are the original selections such as the luminescent ""First Snowfall"" and breathtaking ""No Eye Had Seen."" All the songs culminate to ""Gloria"" which is clearly the album's definitive moment and the one song that will be repeated endlessly.There is no denying the one element that makes this Christmas collection stand out from all the others: joy. From the beginning strains of Ronn Huff's brilliant orchestrations to the simple yet heart-rendering finale, Smith has tapped into a fountain of joy that will continue to make listeners thirst for more.With ""Christmas,"" Smith has found the perfect mixture of musical and lyrical content. Along with his two previous studio efforts ""The Big Picture"" and ""I 2 (eye),"" ""Christmas"" rounds out a musical period that, for Smith, can arguably be called his finest. This is one for the record books.  Michael W. Smith gives a stellar performance on a truly magical Christmas album.  I always play this when trimming my Christmas tree.I agree with the poster below that the song ""All Is Well"" is worth the price of the album alone.  It's definitely the track to set your CD player on ""loop.""  Trust me, you won't tire of it. Michael W. Smith provides  wonderful contemporary Chrismas music. It is a perennial favorite with our family. I bought this for our daughter who wanted another copy. I love his rendition of Angels We have heard on high,with Gloria,It became my new favorite song last Christmas,when Don had Sirus tv,Songs of The Season. It is extremely worshipful - takes the Season where I think Jesus would like it to be - the true meaning in song. I've had this album for a very long time.  Smitty shares the microphone with different choirs - and a full orchestra.  The sound is fantastic - and you find yourself getting drawn into the music.I lent my cd to some friends - and after two years had to wrestle it out of their hands.This IS a Christmas album that you will want to included in your collection. this was the first michael smith album that I purchased. I bought it because of the song Gloria that I heard playing on the radio.....it is an OK album with Gloria being the best song on the album....I thought there would be more singing of more traditional songs.....I need something to warm up my voice to before going to mass to cantor and this isnt quite what I need.....I probably would buy more of his albums if I heard a particular song on the radio that I liked. I love to listen to this album, even when it isn't the Christmas Season.  Michael W. Smith is a gifted performer and arranger of the orchestral accompaniments to his own music. I love Michael W. Smith's music but this CD is very poorly produced. The sound is not up to the standard of his other music. Michael W. Smith is the most talented Christian vocalist I've ever heard!  His music is his own arrangements and wonderful to listen to.  Such a Godly inspiration. Gloria is an absolute masterpiece.  I enjoyed all the songs but Gloria is my favorite!  Michael has done a wonderful arrangement on the old classic Christmas song.  I saw MWS in concert Dec. 3 at MCI Center in Washington DC  &amp; this song was performed magnificently!  It gave me chills.  We need  to hear more! Gorgeous music, beautiful voice--I play it year round, even though it is Christmas music.  It is soothing, relaxing, lyrical, everything I love in music. I thought I was getting the same music as a cantata I sang it a few years ago but this isn't it and isn't as good. This CD was a real departure for Michael W. Smith.  Released right after his i2(eye) CD, it was a complete style change - from 80's pop/rock to a choral sound.  I must admit at first I was really disappointed, but the CD has grown on me until it's become one of my favorites.This CD sounds more like a choral album then an artist driven solo project.  In fact, Michael doesn't even have all the solos.  The music is full orchestra for a Christmas pageant feel.  There are very few traditional carols on here, except in instrumental form.  As a result, it takes several listens before it sounds remotely Christmassy.  However, there are some powerful lyrics in the new songs that remind me of the wonder of the first Christmas.  And &quot;Gloria&quot; is a fun rendition of the classic &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; that I have heard performed many times by choirs since this came out.Definitely buy this CD, but give it some time before you make up your mind about it.  I'm certainly glad I did because I look forward to hearing it every Christmas. We really enjoy this album it isn't Christmas without this wonderful worship Cd. So glad we were able to get it. As I sat on a train bound for Illinois in November of 1989, I couldn't wait to listen and see what MWS would do on a Christmas Album.  At first I  was so surprised at what I found, but after listening to it over a dozen  times while on that train trip, I realized that this was some of the best  Christmas music I had ever heard. I couldn't stop listening.  It captures  your heart and transports you to another time and place, of Christmas'  past. It infact does sound like an awesome movie soundtrack, and I remember  him saying back when this was released that he wanted to compose movie  soundtracks. This was maybe his first shot at it. Due to the overwhelming  quality of music on this CD, MWS may be under using his  unbelievable  talent and I beg of someone to offer him the opportunity.  I also wish  Michael would do more recordings like this. You will enjoy this  masterpiece, and not just at Christmastime!  Be prepared to have a  wonderful experience listening to this, some of his very best work! I've been a Smitty fan since day one, and had always enjoyed his pop style.  When I first played &quot;Christmas&quot;, I was a fan all over again.  This man has proven himself to be one of the most flexible artists  I've ever heard.NOT TO BE MISSED: His instrumental rendition of  &quot;Silent Night&quot; The incredible duet with Amy Grant, &quot;No eye  had seen&quot; In my humble opinion, Smith's Christmas cd is the best one I've ever heard, and I have listened to many!Admittingly, since I am a big Michael W. Smith fan, I purchased the cd with high expectations.  Fortunately, the expectations were exceeded!The cd contains a nice balance of reverent (All Is Well) and upbeat songs (Christ The Messiah), with each song positively contributing to the spirit of the Christmas season. Being the kind of person who listens to Christmas cds year-round, I heartily recommend the cd to anyone who either plays Christmas cds only during the holiday season or year-round! This album is at the core of my Christmas music listening.  It wouldn't seem like Christmas to me without hearing this collection of great songs.  I can listen to this album again... and again... and again!! Ever had one of those songs speak to you and you can't get it out of your head? Found it on this CD and made the purchase in time for Christmas. Wonderful service and the product was exactly what I'd heard, not to mention the rest of the songs on this CD are great for Christmas. Michael has captured the true atmosphere of Christmas in this album; an atmosphere that stays throughout the album.  He cleverly mixes classical choral and orchestral pieces with more contempory work to create a seamless  movement that seems to take you through the story of Christ's birth and the  wonder of it. Whether Smitty was trying to acheive this or not I am not  sure but it is truely wonderful. You need to listen to this album over and  over to really 'get into' the depths of what's going on here.  All I can  say is that it truely touches me each time I listen to it. I mean - God...  With us? Emmanuel? Our redeemer comes! This album is far greater than the  sum of it's parts and as a complete work it stands unique and is my #1 all  time favourite album for Christmas.  If you don't have it GET IT! God Bless  You. When I purchased this CD I was not sure what to expect.  I was not much of a Michael Smith fan at the time. I liked some of his songs, but not crazy about his voice. Every year I like to purchase a new Christmas CD. I have just about everything that is popular and known, oldies and new.  For some reason I decided to give this one a listen.  WOW.  I listened to this CD over and over for hours.  I have always liked well produced music.  This one CD stands alone.  If you want to discover the genius on Michael Smith, this one CD will convince you that he has extrodinary talent.  Words are inadequit to describe this CD.  The CD should be listened in its entirety.  Each song lends itself to the next.  Each time I listen to this CD I feel like I have been taken to another world.  Its breathtaking.  I love this CD.  I have owned over 1500 records and CDs in my life.  This one ranks up there in my all time top 5. Michael was at my house the summer before this album was releasedHe was so excited as it was his first Christmas Album..  After all these years its still my favorite of his..I buy copies every year for someone new on my list!  He always love Old Hymns etc and I was really very happy with the way this CD turned out and how he put a new twist on some Old favorite Christmas Music! Even though this was from 1989?  I have just recently heard it on Christian radio.  Sharred 1 song withnmy women's Bible study and had numerous people come up to and ask me where it came from.  Amazon.com.  Cheap.  Or if you are sckeptical look up the song Gloria in excise this deo/hark the herald angles sing, Michael W. Smith Christmas Album.  This is one example of what is on the CD. This is not necessarily a seasonal CD. We listen to it often in our home year-round. The song ""All is Well"" is amazing !  The solo sung in the beginning by the young boy is touching to say the least. I'm not a big fan of M.W. Smith's vocals, although he is tolerable can't get past that he sounds like Elmer Fudd. Regardless, I bought the CD due mainly to the Boys Choir - extremely talented group. In my opinion, this is the finest Christmas album ever produced, and by far the high point of Michael W. Smith's impressive career.  There are not enough superlatives to describe it:  the majesty of it is breathtaking.  At points, it simply sweeps you away.  It is at once fully modern and almost classical.  It is utterly unique.Additionally, fans of Smith will note that this was the capstone of the &quot;sound&quot; he portrayed in the 1980s.  He shifted gears pretty dramatically after this.This album really is timeless, powerful, worshipful, and must not be missed.  Despite its uniqueness, there's nothing trendy to it, and it will last through the ages. Spectacular.  Still.I look forward to listening to this CD every Christmas season and it hasn't let me down yet.  It stands virtually unparalleled for its scope and sequence.In a clear departure from his previous Contemporary Christian sound, which itself had been ratcheted up a notch with _The Big Picture_ and _i2eye_, Smith delivers a thoughtful, introspective, and diverse set of songs--majestic one moment, intimate the next.  He steps aside and lets his arranging and songwriting do the work:  choral, instrumental, duet--it's all here.The choral ""Overture"" is a grand affair, ""Lux Venit""continues that choral feel (with gorgeous lyrics), ""Anthem for Christmas"" is, well, ""anthemic.""  ""First Snowfall"" is a beautiful instrumental piano piece that recalls some of his earlier instrumental numbers.  ""Christ the Messiah"" returns to the epic sound from the first couple of tracks, ""No Eye Had Seen"" is a duet with Amy Grant that previews ""All is Well,"" a stunning boy's choir number with an equally stunning solo by one of the choir's members.  It is simply chilling (in a good way).  Another instrumental  medley of carols shows Smith's composing and arranging skills, ""Gloria"" confirms those arranging skills, with a take on ""Angels We Have Heard on High.""  The disc concludes with quite possibly the most striking song on the CD:  ""Silent Night.""  It is a stunningly simple arrangement, brief, not cluttered up with sappy vocals or the cliched lyrics..  Smith brings out the profound simplicity of the season with this solo piano arrangement, brief though it is.  Longer and/or louder would have been too much--it is the perfect closing to a near-perfect effort.It just doesn't get any better than this for Christmas CDs, and only two or three others are in the conversation for me. This is MWS's first Christmas album, to clarify confusing comments on another review here.  I have it on a cassette, which by now has worn out, so I purchased the MP3 album to replace it. It has been a favorite of mine for at least twenty years.I enjoy the album because Smith is a talented arranger of traditional favorite Christmas songs, as well as a talented writer of his own original music. Songs such as All Is Well have become new classics, now covered by others (Clay Aiken, for example.) Lux Venit, an offering that features a boys choir and latin lyrics, is another special favorite of mine. I find this CD so uplifting and so capable of putting me in a worshipful frame of mind that I enjoy listening to it all year round. This album is a work of art: you seriously don't realize you are stopping from one song and going on to the next.  The entire album is one piece of beautiful, meaningful, heartfelt expression.Every single Christmas when I sit down and put this album on, it makes me smile.  If you can't get into the Christmas spirit, stick on Smitty, you will.  Although his latest effort, &quot;Christmastime&quot;, is well-acclaimed, I think that &quot;Christmas&quot; deserves the spotlight.  This is Mr. Smith in full-fledged talent and inspiration.  I agree, Smitty pal, if you've been thinking about doing movie soundtracks, STOP thinking, and START writing!  &quot;Christmas&quot; is your one-stop yuletide album.  It's just timeless, it NEVER gets old.  And this humble man with a heart for Jesus brings it alive. Of all the Christmas albums I've listened to over the years, Michael W. Smith's ""Christmas"" remains my number one favorite.I first picked up this album (on cassette!) when I was a freshmen in college in Minnesota back in 1989. (Amazon incorrectly lists that this came out in 1993). Because I really enjoyed his previous album i 2 (EYE),  I was excited when I saw this sitting in the stores.I brought it back to the dorm room, and popped it into the boom box (remember those?). A light snowfall outside enhanced the enjoyment of this album. Each song compliments the others, and all works together in a incredible 37 minute listening experience!The instrumental ""First Snowfall"" is forever locked into memory as a favorite as I listened to the track and watched the light snowfall outside. As I now live in Oklahoma, snowfall is rare. However if we do get even a few flakes in December, I clear my schedule and enjoy the snowfall, with this album playing in the background.""All is Well"" is another personal favorite. It starts off the with single voice of a boy singing, and eventually ends in the full choir. I love how in later albums MWS uses this same technique. Start with one voice or instrument, and end the song with the full chorus and orchestra.If you are still debating getting this CD, go ahead and buy it or download the MP3's. If you download the MP3's, be sure to listen to them in order! ""Christmas"" hails from a time when all songs worked together, and flowed into one long story. Make yourself some hot chocolate, (or if you are in the south, turn down the A/C!) and completely clear your schedule for the next 40 minutes and listen. Let the images of the world at peace on Christmas Eve work their magic, and for a brief moment, allow yourself to dream that ""All is Well"" in this world. I've owned this album since I bought the tape in 1989 and have listened to it every Christmas since.  Pulling it from the case is usually the first sign Christmas is close.  I can't think of a better tradition.  Last year we saw Michael W. Smith live for a Christmas concert in Dallas, TX and it was a true highlight.  This is a great CD. This album has been around since the 80's, but it really stands the test of time.  Michael uses lush orchestral and choral arrangements to bring us the sounds of Christmas. The original compositions (Christmas Anthem, First Snowfall, All is Well, Gloria) have become true classics.  I can't describe the feeling I get when I listen to this CD.  I'm in awe of the majesty and glory of the God who sent His only son to be born in a stable and wrapped in swaddling clothes.Also check out his more recent Christmas album, Christmastime, which is also excellent.  I have written reviews of many Christmas CDs - check them out!  And have a very merry Christmas! This will probably be the highwater mark in Michael W. Smith's career because this is truly a magical Christmas album.  The music, the lyrics, even Smith's modest vocals all work to make this one of my all-time favorite Christmas CDs.  Standouts from the album include &quot;Christ The Messiah,&quot; &quot;No Eye Had Seen,&quot; and the simple yet incredibly beautiful &quot;All Is Well.&quot;  That last piece is worth the price of the CD.  Smith, who in my opinion, is a better musician than a vocalist, really has created his masterwork here.  The production is lush and the tone is absolutely perfect.  A modern Christmas classic that you will never tire of. This album has to be one of his best. Often I have one or two favorites on an album, but every song is so beautiful. Here it is almost March and I can't stop listening to it. I feel so uplifted no matter what. So beautiful. I love this album and play it every Christmas.  This music is especially nice for people who have a very religious feeling of the birth of Christ in this season.  As a Christian person, I really relayed to this music,  Took me back to singing the hymns in choir as a child. This has to be one of the most moving Christmas albums ever. The songs are all wonderful and the execution flawless.  Listen carefully to the lyrics. I like my Michael W. Smith ""Christmas"" CD.  In fact, I also have his ""Christmastime"" CD, which I forgot to mention by name.  Michael W. Smith is one of my favorite Christian artists.  I want to thank the seller and amazon.com. Without a doubt - this album is the best I have ever listened to.  It's Christmas - but I listen to it throughout the year.  I still purchase this CD for gifts - and the receivers rave about it.  It lifts you into a realm of worship and awe.  No other Christmas album has come close to this masterpiece.

168,366,B0000004RI,"Great guitar work on this album. I like the slower songs more as I think it fits Wes' style better and can really show off the beautiful and intricate guitar sounds. Especially ""Don't Say I Love You Too Soon"" and ""Your Voice"". I have found Wes King's songwriting (along with Steven Curtis Chapman'sBeauty Will Rise& Michael W. Smith'sThe First Decade, 1983-1993songwriting) to adhere well with what the Bible teaches. All of Wes Kings songs are great. They have words of truth and are good for worship.

169,368,B0000004RO,"One cannot go wrong with any Rich Mullins album. They are all awesome!! Wish I had bought all of his albums sooner. Delivery on time and the cd was out of this world. I recommend the seller with 5 star. Our family loves Rich Mullins. This is one of his earlier works; his voice is a bit more affected in some of the songs and the music is more closely aligned with popular music of the time than Mullins' later albums. Nonetheless, the lyrics and the authenticity are true to Mullins' exemplary form, and it is hard not to appreciate the youthful optimism the album conveys as a whole. I'll tell you right up front that there are some cheesy synthesizers in this music!  That being said, it is a wonderful album.  This would be a great album for a kid to grow up with.  &quot;Pictures in the Sky&quot; is a totally childlike song, fun and uplifting even for adults.  I think &quot;What Trouble are Giants&quot; is the best on the album with the chorus of:&quot;What trouble are giants? What's wrong with being small?  The bigger they come, you know the harder they fall. When you're fightin' for Zion and you're on the Lord's side, I think you're gonna find they ain't no trouble at all.&quot;Other excellent songs on the album are &quot;Verge of a Mircale&quot; and &quot;Could be a Celebration.&quot;  This music is fun and not shallow.  If you're looking into Rich Mullins for the first time, you might want to start with the albums &quot;Winds of Heaven...&quot;, &quot;Never Picture Perfect&quot;, or &quot;Liturgy&quot;.  But if you have several of his albums, you will enjoy this one (especially if you have kids).  These songs make me remember childlike wonder about salvation, about Bible stories, and even about clouds. classic music with a down to earth Christian message.  Rich Mullin was the quintessential Christan song writer. If you like '80s music, then you probably will like this album.I first bought the cd when I was a young man, 21 years old, and it has been a favorite of mine ever since.  I remember buying it brand new back in a music store and I think it's now out of print, unfortunetely (but looks like you can still buy the mp3 album, though not as good as CD I think).People just don't make music like this anymore.  It's upbeat, has great, lyrics, is down to earth, and simple.  A fun album to listen too, kind of addicting and has many very upbeat songs.I can say nothing bad about this album.  The synthesizers or keyboards sound great to me.Listened to it so much, I got it scratched on accident and skips at a certain part.Recommend it, as there is none other like it. This recording is very good heart touching but yet upbeat.  Some songs are fun (such as Screendoor on a Submarine) and others are very heart felt and beautiful (Verge of a Miracle, Thief in the Night and Be With You).This is a must buy for any Rich Mullins fan.  I still have the tape. Great contemporary Christian music anyone can enjoy, I highly recommend this CD to anyone.  Thank you for making it available.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop",one cannot go wrong rich mullins awesome wish bought sooner delivery time cd world recommend seller star family loves rich mullins one earlier works voice bit affected closely aligned popular time mullins later nonetheless lyrics authenticity true mullins exemplary form hard appreciate youthful optimism conveys whole ill tell right front cheesy synthesizers said wonderful would great kid grow quot pictures sky quot totally childlike fun uplifting even adults think quot trouble giants quot best chorus quot trouble giants whats wrong small bigger co one go wrong wrong rich rich mullins awesome wish bought sooner delivery time cd world recommend seller star family loves rich rich mullins earlier works voice bit affected closely aligned popular time later nonetheless lyrics authenticity true exemplary form hard appreciate youthful optimism conveys ill tell right cheesy synthesizers said wonderful great kid grow pictures sky quot totally childlike fun uplifting adults think quot trouble giants best chorus quot trouble giants wrong bigger
170,369,B0000004RS,"If you like Rich Mullins and don't have this album, your music collection is incomplete!  The lyrics are extraordinary yet down to earth.  Beautiful yet honest.  They always point you to Christ and leave you with a little bit more hope than you had before. I love Rich Mullins' music, and even now, 12 years after his death, still miss the wonderful music he used to make.  This album is wonderful - personal songs (Eli and Let Mercy Lead both made me think that Rich had settled down, married and had children, he sings with so much empathy and love), songs that help us relate as regular human beings to the love of God.  Definitely, he's leading choirs in heaven - too bad for us he got to go there so soon! Rich Mullins' music grew out of a heart that earnestly sought to be God's. Rich saw them largely as Christian entertainment. Yet as Jesus said, we know a tree by its fruit--and much fruit has come from the music of this remarkable man. Never Picture Perfect contains some of Rich's greatest songs. &quot;First Family&quot; was a song Rich wrote for his Mom and Dad on their anniversary. If it does not move you, nothing will. &quot;The Love of God&quot; is possibly the greatest song Rich ever wrote. &quot;Somewhere&quot; and &quot;Bound to Come Some Trouble&quot; are also up there in the pantheon of Rich's songs. Rich Mullins made some remarkable CDs in his time. Never Picture Perfect is as good as any of them. The greatest thing I can think to say about Rich or this disc is that he, like his parents, &quot;worked to give faith hands and feet--and somehow gave it wings.&quot; I use 2 have all Rich Mullens CD until i wore them out!!!  Was so glad 2 renew my collection!!! This is one of my favorite CD!! I have every one of his albums, I admit.  But if you can only buy one or  two, you should probably start with this one.  The songs are so powerful  and true.This is the album that has meant the most to me out of all of  them...I made it through some difficult times singing in tears to,  &quot;Bound to Come Some Trouble.&quot;  &quot;Hope to Carry On&quot; still  picks me up everytime I listen.  This music has a way of touching you where  you hurt and helping you heal.  I don't know of another artist who does  this without resorting to cliches or sickening sweetness.  These songs  remind me of God's love and truth that will always sustain.What means  a lot to me is that Rich didn't cover up poor musical abilities with  &quot;God-lyrics.&quot;  He combined amazing talent and skill with powerful  poetry and gave us beauty. &quot;Somewhere amidst these ins and these outs, there's a fine line of purpose I follow even now. Through the haze of despair that confuses and hurts us I look to see that You're there; and I run toward Your light &quot;... Rich Mullins sings these lines on the song &quot;Somewhere,&quot; which is the tenth track on this remarkable recording. Each song on this disc expresses some aspect of God's light shining down upon us in our everyday lives.I'll be right up front and tell you that I love all of Rich Mullins' CDs. He is my favorite singer/songwriter type of guy. Now that we've established that fact, let me tell you why you should get a copy of this album...The songs. Never Picture Perfect is FILLED with good songs. From the opening rendition of the hymn &quot;I Will Sing&quot; to the reprise of &quot;Love the of God&quot; Each of these songs are individually worthy of multiple-nay, repeated listenings (although &quot;The Book of Love&quot; really, really, doesn't fit in sonically). Besides the afore mentioned &quot;Somewhere,&quot; three songs really strike me as being particularly great.The first is &quot;Hope to Carry On.&quot; It describes the change that the Love of God brings about in the world.  As Rich says in the song: &quot;Love could make a beggar rich, He could set a prisoner free. I know He could do it for you-God knows He did it for me.&quot; The most moving part of the song for me is when Rich talks about love causing Peter to put away his sword. This strikes a cord in my life because I am the kind of person who is all too often ready to go to war over every little thing...Yet Jesus has called us to something much higher. Or, as Rich so skillfully notes:  &quot;Love has come-and He's given me hope to carry on.&quot;The second song that blows me away is &quot;First Family.&quot; It is awesome just from the standpoint of being a nearly perfectly written song. It is a song about Rich's own family that he wrote for his Mom and Dad's anniversary. It has caused me to take personal stock of the family God has blessed me with.My favorite song on &quot;Never Picture Perfect&quot; is &quot;The Love of God.&quot; It is truly a GREAT song. I give this CD my highest recommendation-and leave you with the words of the last verse of &quot;The Love of God&quot;--may they take root in your soul:&quot;Joy and sorrow are this ocean and in their every ebb and flow-now the Lord a door has opened that all Hell could never close. Here I'm tested and made worthy, tossed about but lifted up in the reckless raging fury that they call the love of God.&quot; The cd I ordered was delivered quickly, the product was in great condition and I am enjoying my music and I would not hesitate to order again. Very pleased with this item and thanks for making it available.  I will recommend it and tell anyone where I found it.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop",like rich mullins dont collection incomplete lyrics extraordinary yet earth beautiful yet honest always point christ leave little bit hope love rich mullins even years death still miss wonderful used make wonderful personal eli let mercy lead made think rich settled married children sings much empathy love help us relate regular human beings love god definitely hes leading choirs heaven bad us got go soon rich mullins grew heart earnestly sought gods rich saw largely christian entertainment yet jesus said know tree fruit much fruit come remarkable man never picture perfect contains richs greatest quot first family quot son like rich rich mullins mullins collection incomplete lyrics extraordinary earth beautiful honest point leave bit hope love rich rich mullins mullins years death miss wonderful used wonderful personal let mercy lead think rich settled married children sings empathy love help relate regular human human beings beings love god definitely leading choirs heaven bad got soon rich rich mullins mullins grew heart earnestly sought gods rich saw largely christian entertainment said know tree tree fruit fruit fruit come remarkable man never picture perfect picture picture perfect perfect contains richs greatest quot family son
171,370,B0000004RU,"&quot;The World As I Best Remember It&quot; and &quot;Songs&quot; by Rich Mullins are essentials to any collection of modern Christian music. so once you learn the words,you can sing as you exercise or even doing the dishes. Rich Mullins loves God and his songs are from the heart and feel good songs. I have been a Rich Mullins fan for years, and this is still my favorite CD.  The passion mixed with the high view of God as creator and sustainer of His universe is fantastic.  If you have never listened to Rich before, this CD is the place to start. Rich Mullins / The world as best as I remember it, Volume 1: A glorious, insightful, brilliant album from a man of Christian faith.  This masterpiece is completed in Volume 2, which is a must-have companion to Volume 1.  Nothing like this had been attempted since Larry Norman's Trilogy.  A Five Star album. This is yet another triumph in the catalog of Rich Mullins.  Rich recorded some of his finest work on this CD and its companion.  The more noteworthy tracks on this album include:Where You AreJacob and 2 WomenCalling Out Your NameWho God is Gonna UseI See YouA must have for any Christian music fan! This is referring to Both volumes 1 and 2.  There are other amazing albums but in my opinion these 2 together create the best Christian music has to offer!!! This has to be one of my all-time favorite albums. Insightful and brilliant lyrics, imaginative instrumentation, and Rich's wonderful perspective of God, the world around us and life. If you're not familiar with Rich Mullins and his folk-gospel music, you couldn't find a better place to start. This album is as unique and profound as the man who penned and sang the songs. I have most of the Rich Mullins collection.  I have to say that this one is by far my favorite.  Each song is masterfully done and each has a deep meaning, something I have noticed with all the works of Rich.  I have enjoyed hearing his Christian journey expressed through his music.  While I like each song on this album, the first three are my favorites.I love how this CD starts with a young male tenor with extreme clarity singing &quot;Oh God you are my God...&quot;(Step by Step).  It is simply beautiful.The next selection is &quot;boy like me/man like you&quot; where Rich likens his birth, childhood and growing up years with what Jesus' life was like.  The comparisons really make you think about Jesus really being God and a Man; a man like you and me.The third selection is &quot;Where are you.&quot;  It talks about different &quot;insignificant&quot; people of the Bible who did powerful things for God and how God protected them.This CD gets an A+ rating.  You will not be disappointed with the purchase of this great CD. wanted this album, did not know where I would get it if not from the internet,. So the ease of of just getting it on line was nice. Common wisdom has it that ""A Liturgy, A Legacy & A Ragamuffin Band"" is Mullins' masterpiece, and ""The World as Best as I Remember It, Vol 1"" is a slightly less great album that points to his magnum opus. I disagree. For one thing, an artist is capable of more than one masterpiece (see Dylan, Stones; or, among Christian artists, Larry Norman, Daniel Amos, Mark Heard)... Personally, I prefer this album over ""A Liturgy"" (which IMO has a great first half and some weaker songs on ""side 2""). The AMG review states that it would have been better if, instead of releasing 2 volumes, the ""best songs"" from each would have been combided into one CD. I strongly disagree; there's not a weak song on Volume 1 (unlike Vol. 2), and holds together very well as a unified album (again, unlike vol 2). There's so much going on here: the beautiful, evocative piano melodies, the restless percussion work, the differing tonal colors of various acoustic instruments, the nice hybrid and melange of differing folk styles (African chorus, Celtic melodies, Appalachian folk, etc.). A beautiful album. I love Rich Mullins' music. All of his recordings are among my favorites. Yet, &quot;The World As Best As I Remember It, Volume 1&quot; is something special. Rich Mullins didn't make any mediocre or bad music. That said, I believe that this could possibly be my favorite Rich Mullins album. All the songs have something to do with the sometimes hidden, sometimes quite visible presence of God in the world. There isn't a bad song on the disc. Each one is excellent.The opening track, &quot;Step by Step,&quot; begins with the lone voice of a child. Rich then repeats what the child has sung as instrumentation is slowly added. The song is about following God in a &quot;step by step,&quot; day by day way. This theme is picked up in the next song: &quot;boy like me/Man like You&quot;. It is a wonderful song about trying to find out what Jesus was like and trying to grow up (in our faith) to be like Him.The song &quot;Where You Are&quot; is not only a favorite of mine, but also of my daughter. She likes it because it sets easily grasped biblical imagery (Jonah in the whale; Daniel in the lion's den; Shadrach, Meshach and Abednigo in the furnace...) to a great tune. I like it for that too...but I love it for its lyrics. Two examples: &quot;Oh you'll meet the Lord in the furnace / A long time before you meet Him in the sky&quot; and &quot;And where you are ain't where you wish that you was / Well your life ain't easy and the road is rough / But where you are is where He promised to be / From the ends of the world to every point of a need.&quot;While I'm on the topic of beautiful lyrics...One would be extremely hard pressed to find more beautiful lyrics than those of &quot;Jacob and 2 Women.&quot; It is a touching song about the biblical story of the relationships between Jacob and his two wives: Leah and Rachel. &quot;The Howling&quot; is another very moving song. It mixes lyrical references to Christ as our redeemer and imagery of the U.S. government's oppression of native Americans. I don't claim to fully understand the song, but to me at least, the key verse is: &quot;'Cause I can see a people dispossessed / Broken and brave in the face of so much fear / Driven from their homes by the greed of a nation / Whose treaties were as good as the litter Along the trail of their tears / I can see the Covenant colors / The sun and the rain have woven against the blue of the sky / And I know if we live we will live by His promise / I know He who made it and / I'm sure that He would not lie.&quot; I may be way off base here, but this sounds like a call to live as the people of God rather than as followers of an all-too fallible man-made nation.&quot;Calling Out Your Name&quot; is a masterpiece of a song. Rich was great at writing songs that praised God through use of nature imagery. &quot;Calling Out Your Name&quot; is one of the best songs in this genre. &quot;Who God is Gonna Use&quot; reminds me a lot of Rich's song &quot;Screen Door&quot; from his earlier &quot;Pictures In The Sky&quot; album. It takes a lesson from scripture and explores it in a musically inventive and entertaining way.&quot;The River&quot; is a melancholy love song. It contains some of the most beautiful lyrics and piano playing on the disc. The song &quot;I See You&quot; is the climax of the disc. It begins faintly--much like &quot;Step by Step&quot; did to open the disc. The choir's echoing of Rich is wonderful. The song speaks of just how visible God can be when we have eyes to see. It also echoes the truth of Isaiah 40:8 &quot;The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever.&quot; The disc then closes with a reprise of &quot;Step by Step.&quot;I love this disc. You will too. I not only recommend it; I urge you to get a copy. This veteran's day I listened again to this wonderful disc. I think especially on a day like today we can all learn a lesson and perhaps take a warning from Rich's words.The song &quot;The Howling&quot; in particular speaks to where we, as Americans have been, are, and continue to go:------------------------------------------&quot;I can see the iron horses' tracksPressed in the mud from the weight of all that steam and steelBut the wind don't blow where you want it to goNo, the wind just goes where it will and you followI can feel the breath of winterDriving this snow across these newly-whited plainsTakes my breath from me and it leaves me fallingThen it picks me up again in its own strengthAnd I can hear the wild wind howlingAnd I can feel it in my bonesAnd I know that the howling will take me homeI can see some traveller's footprintsThere's a little bit of blood in every step he madeI wonder what kind of burden he's bearingThat has cut him so deeply every step along the long, long wayIn the west I see an eveningThis scarlet thread stretched beneath the gathering darkRed as the blood on the hands of the SaviorAnd rich as the mercy that flowed from His broken heartAnd I can hear the wild wind howlingAnd I can feel it in my bonesAnd I know that the howling will take me homeThese men of violence, they have made this a world full of warsOh God break Your silence and let Your justice shine forthShow some mercy, Oh Lord'Cause I can see a people dispossessedBroken and brave in the face of so much fearDriven from their homes by the greed of a nationWhose treaties were as good as litterAlong the trail of their tearsI can see the Covenant colorsThe sun and the rain have woven against the blue of the skyAnd I know if we live we will live by His promiseI know He who made it andI'm sure that He would not lieAnd I can hear the wild wind howlingAnd I can feel it in my bonesAnd I know that the howling will take me home&quot;------------------------------------The choice is ours.The rest is silence. A great album from the first song, &quot;Step by step&quot;, to the last.  It's wonderful to have someone write lyrics that's not sugar-coated like so  many of today's christian music.  Rich doesn't go for cliches in any of his  albums and especially does a great job of talking about the stories of the  Bible in this album.  No other person with the exception of Carmen can do  it but Rich does it with his &quot;best rhyme and rhythm&quot; as he sang  in &quot;Here in America&quot;.  He was the only writer who can write such  lyrics with utter depth, honesty, and truth.I could just feel the  yearning for Jesus in these songs; especially in &quot;the howling&quot;,  &quot;calling out your name&quot;, and &quot;I can see you&quot;.  I love  to sing  in &quot;I can see you&quot; along with the children choir who  echoes Rich.  This one ranks up there with the Jesus Record and Liturgy,  legagay, and a raggamuffin band. The world as best as I remember it vol 1 blew me away. Right from the first note I was hooked. If I was forced to pick out two favourites it would be track 6 and 9 but they are all so moving. I am quite new to Rich's work. I saw a documentary about him on the God Channel and felt an affinity with him. When I play this album I feel as though he's with me which helps me when I am writing my own songs. I will buy all of his albums one by one as I just love his work (it's no wonder God took him early). All of the Rich Mullins albums I own, I would say this is the best one. All the songs are just great. My favorite songs are ""Calling Out Your Name"", ""Boy Like Me/Man Like You"", ""I See You"", and ""Step by Step"". Rich Mullins is an awesome songwriter and this is his best album. This is what you get when you have brilliant songwriting along with passion and soul.Certainly Richs'best work and a contemporary Christian classic.Personal favorite:""Calling Out Your Name""Rich images with lovely hammer dulcimer from Mullins.Not a wasted note on the whole album.Essential stuff. Breathtaking pretty much sums up this album.  Especially The River.  I cry everytime I hear it.  If you can listen to that song without crying then you are probably dead. I am so grateful to have found Rich before his death. I have each and every CD & video on the man and his life, all 6 stars. He never put a note or lyric on paper! For those not aware of this man, he was best known for ""Awesome God,"" which just about everybody has recorded and ""Creed,"" which even Mac Powell & Third Day did. Rich would just go into the studio with his acoustic guitar, play them and sing. They had to do the musical notes, lyrics and arrangements. They were only in his head. He said that God would just give them to him. The man was far ahead of us left here on earth, a place he was not prepared for, nor comfortable in, a homeless man. He drove his agents and mgrs. crazy. He performed mostly in Church concerts, leaving many Preachers wordless. You never knew what would come out of his mouth, but you knew it would be simple, practical, truthful, again, leaving many a Preacher dazed and confused. He, like me, hated organized religion. Jesus didn't even like religion, FAITH is what it's all about. Rich would always say, when going against what Preachers might say, ""Hey, it doesn't make them bad, their just wrong.""His last CD, ""The Jesus Project,"" he went to the studio, recorded the songs with an acoustic guitar only, then gave away every song to his friends. Ragamuffin Band, w/Rick Elias did an awesome job on ""My Deliverer."" I highly suggest their CD, ""Prayers of a Ragamuffin Band."" As well as Mitch McVicker's. Mitch was with Rich in the accident and was not expected to survive. The most prolific singer/songwriter of his time. He had no idea what he was worth. All money went to the Board of his Church, he was paid the average pay scale of the year. The last year of his life, he made $26,000.00. His royalties alone are still staggering. I put him right up there with the late Keith Green. Another unbelievable story.

172,371,B0000004RW,"This album has touched my heart many times. Though I think a new listener exploring Rich Mullins should by SONGS first, this is my personal favorite. It is intimate and compelling. &quot;Sometimes By Step&quot; always brings me to the throne of worship. The lyrics are a refreshing water to my spirit. In this album Rich's connection to the spiritual heart of people really is proven. His lyrics say so much of what I feel in my spiritual journey. My all time favorite RM song appears on this album and I am saddened that it did not make the cut onto either of the two greatest hits compelations. The song is THE MAKER OF NOSES. This is really one of those moments where his music speaks to my spirit. It addresses those times in our lives when we don't know what lies ahead or the best decision to make. We feel pulled by everyone's opinions but when it comes down to it we just have to have faith that Christ will lead us if we follow Him. It stirs my soul and the whole CD is worth buying for this one song.  I have personal thoughts of WHAT SUSAN SAID as it reminds me of the ministry I did with friends when I was carefree and single. Those moments were God sent. I learned so much about the Father and life doing ministry when I was younger. My wife is an awesome gift and this song reminds me of how God spiritually was preparing me for her and our future together in ministry by allowing me to minister with my frioends for several years. The version of &quot;All the Way My Savior Leads Me&quot; that appears on this CD was performed at my ordination to ministry. It is simple and beautiful and it was a blessing to me as my sister played the guitar and sang using Rich's arrangement only a month after he went home to be with the Lord. I could go on and on about this CD but for lack of space and time I just want to emplore you to buy it. It has become an old friend that ministers to my heart and if you let it, I am sure it will do the same for you! When this album first came out in the late spring of '92, I was disappointed. While clearly a very good album, it just didn't seem to live up to its predecessor, The World As Best As I Remember It, Volume 1. On top of that, producer Reed Arvin had seemed to go overboard with the strings this time around, making the album seem overproduced.Well, I put this album on for its first spin in several years a few weeks ago, and while I still see the same flaws, they seem much less pronounced now. This album is the work of an artist who is near the top of his game, although (I'd argue) not quite  there.The album begins with as close-to-perfect of an album opener as I can imagine, ""Hello, Old Friends."" There's a bittersweetness to this tune that tugs at your heart immediately. At the time, this was (reportedly) to be Mullins' last album (thankfully, it was not), and now, it's about seven years since we lost Rich. So even 12 years after this album first came out, when Mullins sings, ""There's really nothing new to say/But the old old story bears repeating,"" both sadness and joy hits you in an inexplicable way. It's quite a feat when a singer can sing a line like ""When you find something worth believing/That's a joy that nothing can take you away"" in a way that makes the listener feel a joy that's come only through trial, adversity, and sorrow. Never schmaltzy, this tune seems perfect for an album that ostensibly is one part of a culminating life's work.We next get the expanded version of the previous album's ""Step by Step"" in ""Sometimes by Step""; Mullins added verses to Beaker's chorus. The childlike innocence of the previous album's opening track had been changed to a more mature mixture of joy and weariness by that album's closing reprise; now, we get the mature reflection of a speaker looking back over his or her life. The verses still seem somewhat incomplete to me, as they did 12 years ago, and Arvin lays on the strings a bit too heavy, but the song's still a very good one.""Everyman"" is a gem, similar in sentiment to Volume 1's ""Who God Is Gonna Use,"" except that the focus is now not who God will use, but who is welcome at the foot of the cross. Rich said once near the end of his life that he was definitely not a Calvinist, and this track proves it, as Rich joyfully exclaims ""With a thorn in His brow, a spear in His side/Nails in His hands He died/For you and I and everyman."" This is followed, however, by a track that displays a more traditionally Refomed theology in ""The Just Shall Live.""""Waiting,"" the side 1 (to date myself) closer is one of the better pieces of poetry on the album. ""To Tell Them"" musically seems out of place on the album; I'm betting that it was one of the songs added after Reunion Records decided that 15 or so tracks was too much for one album and broke The World As Best As I Remember It into two releases. Still, it displays Rich's quirky side quite well.""The Maker of Noses"" is, to my mind, the second best track on the album, as Rich examines the cost of following Christ and the futility of any other pursuit. If the idea of following the One who has made your nose is a personal sentiment, ""What Susan Said"" is an even more personal track detailing the friendship Mullins had with cohort and frequent cowriter Beaker. A reference to ""Wally and the Beaver"" would be pure hokum in the hands of most writers, but Mullins' obvious emotion makes it seem fresh.The album now comes to its climax. ""Growing Young,"" inspired by an analogy used by G.K. Chesterton, is the album's high point. This is what it all of life boils down to, according to Rich: ""And when I thought that I was all alone/It was your voice I heard calling me back home/And I wonder now Lord what was it made me wait so long/And what kept you waiting for me all that time/Was your love stronger than my foolish pride/Won't you take me back now/Take me back and let me be your child/'Cause I've been broken now, I've been shamed/I've learned to cry and I've learned how to pray/And I'm learning, I'm learning even I can be changed."" Literary influences aside, it takes quite a writer to put such a deeply personal spin on the story of the prodigal son and make it seem so original. This song is heartbreaking and can leave you feeling wracked emotionally.Appropriately enough, that emotional climax is followed by a childlike expression of trust in Rich's soothing rendition of the hymn ""All the Way My Savior Leads Me."" And the denouement continues with the album closer, a brief reprise of ""Sometimes by Step.""At the time this album came out, some reviewers said that Volume 1 is from a child's perspective, while there's more maturity in Volume 2. That's too simplistic a conclusion. For all of the maturity evident in this album, no song in either volume is as mature or world-weary as Rich's ruminations on lost relationships and death in ""The River,"" off of Volume 1. And both ""Growing Young"" and the simple trust of ""All the Way My Savior Leads Me"" brings Volume 2 back to a childlike perspective.To my mind, this album is still not the equal of Volume 1, but Volume 1 was an incredibly hard act to follow. Volume 2 is an excellent album no matter which way you slice it; while not all songs are of the same quality, the album is an incredibly ambitious one that succeeds in 90 to 95 percent of its intentions. And that's a high enough success rate to make it worth 5 stars -- and every minute of your time. If you ask ten people what entering heaven will be like, you'll likely get ten different answers.  I imagine I will find myself sitting around a warm campfire with a group of people, watching and listening as Rich Mullins plays acoustic guitar and sings ""Hello Old Friends.""  Having the opportunity to listen to this song, and the others on this wonderful CD, is a taste of Heaven on Earth.Rich Mullins was an incredible artist, a poetic painter with words and melody.  This disc laid the groundwork for his masterpiece: ""A Liturgy, a Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band"" - while it is not quite that masterpiece, it is nonetheless an incredible work of art, well deserving of a five star rating.The disc begins with Rich playing acoustic guitar and singing:  ""Hello old friends  / There's really nothing new to say / But the old, old story bears repeating /And the plain old truth grows dearer every day / When you find something worth believing / Well, that's a joy that nothin' could take away."" Listening to this disc brings me great joy, and I like to start most every day off by listening to it.Rich revisits the tune Step By Step (now titled ""Sometimes By Step""), played on the hammered dulcimer.  The chorus remains familiar (""Oh God, You are my God / And I will ever praise you / I will seek you in the morning / And I will learn to walk in your ways / And Step by Step you lead me / And I will follow you all of my days""), and the new verses are beautifully poetic.Orchestral strings lead off ""Everyman"" - a song that refers to various Biblical characters who were touched by Jesus during their lives, in many different circumstances, and reminds the listener: ""At the foot of the cross there's room for everyone / And love that is not blind / It can look at who we are and still see beyond / The differences we find / But with thorns in His brow and a spear in His side / Nails in His hand, He died for you and I / For you and I and everyman.""A solo piano introduces ""The Just Shall Live""  - The song grows as it goes, with percussion being added, then strings, and then a chorus as the listener is taken on a journey to the last days, when ""the meek shall inherit the earth"" and the just shall live - then the song resolves with solo piano.""Waiting"" is one of my favorite songs by Rich.  A song to listen to when you need encouragement, when you feel that you are being tested, yet you just can't walk away from the Truth - and so you wait upon the Lord, having the faith that your strength will be renewed.""To Tell Them"" is an experiemental departure - a different song, with an odd time signature, piano and percussion, and sort of a funky world beat. Kevin Max Smith (from DC Talk) sings background on this track.It's back to a familiar sound with ""The Maker of Noses"", a song that slowly builds in great Rich style.  A wonderful song about seeking justice, and getting frustrated with the advice of this world to follow our hearts, our noses, our dreams - since these things don't lead to the Truth.  We must follow the Father of hearts, the Maker of noses, and the Giver of dreams.""What Susan Said"" is a great story song about friendship.  Whether it is Paul and Silas, or Abbot and Costello, nothing beats having a friend by your side.  But what did Susan say?""How love is found in the things we've given up / More than in the things that we have kept.""""Growing Young"" is a beautiful and poetic song about running back to God with tears in our eyes after our multitude of sins.  It serves as a reminder that we are all sinners in need of a Savior and as a foreshadowing of the ragamuffin theory that Rich would explore in more detail on his next album.Rich closes the album with a beautiful version of the Crosby Hymn ""All the Way my Savior Leads Me"" and a reprise of his own praise and worship classic ""Step By Step.""This is a great follow-up to Volume One, and a wonderful precursor to his masterpiece. so like volume 1,you have 11 to enjoy . Rich Mullins puts his talents for Godly use, great cd . This is one of the Rich Mullin's albums that everyone should have.  It continues to bless me over and over.  The visionary &quot;Maker of Noses&quot; and the most soul-searching song I have ever heard,  &quot;Growing Young&quot; will stir your soul (and maybe bring you to  tears).  I miss Rich.  I know he is heaven and he is laughing. Rich Mullins / The world as best as I remember it, Volume 2: This album completes the great First Volume of this short series and does so as masterfully as that first volume began it.  This is also a Masterpiece album.The tracks on Volume 2 are:-hello old friends-sometimes by step-everyman-the just shall live-waiting-to tell them-the maker of noses-what susan said-growing young-all the way my savior leads me-sometimes by step (reprise) Rich Mullins, once again, stirs souls with this sequel to TWASBIRI-Vol. 1.  Some of the more noteworthy songs are &quot;Sometimes by Step&quot;, &quot;Everyman&quot;, &quot;To Tell Them&quot;, &quot;The Maker of Noses&quot;, &quot;Growing Young&quot;, and &quot;All The Way My Savior Leads Me&quot;.  Of course, any song he wrote has significant meaning.  The meoldies further amplify the ever-important messages he delivers. This album is personal, it is radical, and it is true.  As I listen to my entire collection of Mullins music, this cd just touches me in a different way.  &quot;Hello Old Friends&quot; makes me feel like Rich is in the room rambling in song about life.  &quot;Sometimes by Step&quot; is a gem that makes me think about the grandness of God's plan throughout history.  And the words of &quot;Everyman&quot; are some of his best:&quot;The world draws up its lines, but at the foot of the cross there's room for everyone.  And love that is not blind, it can look at who we are and still see beyond the differences we find.  But with thorns in his brow and a spear in his side, nails in his hands, He died, for you and I, for you and I and everyman.&quot;My least favorite song on the album is &quot;To Tell Them.&quot;  The message is excellent, but the style is different than the typical Rich music.  &quot;What Susan Said&quot; is one of those sentimental type songs that makes you look back on your life and realize what matters, makes you think about what true love is.  Finally, &quot;All the Way My Savior Leads Me&quot; is simply played and beautifully performed.  It is a song that gives me something to hold onto when life gets hard.If you're looking into Rich's albums, this one and &quot;Never Picture Perfect&quot; are both excellent first choices. I can not say enough about this album. It truly captures the soul of Rich Mullins and stands behind only A liturgy, A Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band. Anyone can appreciate the honesty, the vulnerability, and the genius of Rich Mullins after listening to this album. I was moved to tears by Growing Young. The Maker of Noses is an incredible song that can not be missed.  And of course there is What Susan Said. It would be worth buying this album just for this song. Also included are such classics as Step by Step and Hello Old Friends. The other day, I was walking through a mall in London Ontario when suddenly, my wife and I passed a man playing a piano in the food court. From what I could tell, he was not a professional--he had laid his shopping bags beside him and just started playing. He was playing Rich Mullins's &quot;Sometimes by Step.&quot; Even without words, the music that Rich Mullins created has the power to stir my soul.&quot;Sometimes by Step&quot; is just one of the great songs on &quot;The World As Best As I Remember It vol. 2.&quot; I know I've said it a lot...but I must say it again...Rich never made bad or even mediocre music. All the songs on this disc are great.The highlights of this disc to me are: &quot;Waiting,&quot; &quot;What Susan Said,&quot; &quot;Growing Young&quot; (probably my favorite track), and Rich's rendition of &quot;All the Way My Savior Leads Me&quot; (Rich was great with hymns by Robert Lowery).The thing that appeal to me most about the work of Rich Mullins is the deep insight of his lyrics. This disc is particularly strong in the lyrics department. Some examples:&quot;When a million voices whisper, and they tell me I should leave, into the shadows that the moon casts on these alleys and these streets. But I know that chasing shadows won't get me anywhere 'cause I've been there...&quot; (Waiting)&quot;Two full grown men in a huddle of kids and they're trying to help them to believe what is too good to be real but is more real than the air they breathe. And it's Wally and the Beaver, David and Jonathan...it's the Love of Jesus puttin' on flesh and bone.&quot; (What Susan Said)&quot;And everybody used to tell me big boys don't cry. Well I've been around enough to know that that was the lie that held back the tears in the eyes of a thousand prodigal sons. Well we are children no more, we have sinned and grown old and our Father still waits and He watches down the road to see the crying boys come running back to His arms and be growing young.&quot; (Growing Young)I cannot recommend this disc, and all of Rich's music enough. Get it. There is nothing like it. If you do a search for Jesus here on Amazon, you're bound to come up with all kinds of stuff...stuff from the Jesus Seminar talking about what a great cynic sage or Jewish Rabbi Jesus was; stuff from the Wiccans--no doubt describing Jesus as yet another earth mystic; stuff from Theologians that you have to work out to be able to lift while at the same time requiring that you keep a dictionary at hand for the every third word you don't know...well scrap all that stuff. I can tell you all you need to know about Jesus by playing you &quot;Growing Young&quot; and handing you a Bible. This stuff is great. Nobody makes music or writes songs like Rich did. This disc is just another case in point. This is an introspective album that probes the heart and direction of a person.  Listening to the words of ""Growing Young"", you find yourself opening up the book of your life and turning through the pages.  It brings greater understanding that we all need a Savior.  Rich bares his soul and in his vulnerability he connects to anyone who questions why they're here.The music itself is classic Rich Mullins style, although a few of the songs stand out as exceptional.  ""Sometimes by Step"", ""Growing Young"", ""Waiting"", ""What Susan Said"", and ""The Maker of Noses"" have been milestones in my life.  They convey personal experiences in a story-telling way that makes you feel like Rich would have been a close friend if you had known him.""To Tell Them"" is a very different style, like a bunch of brothers jamming on the shady front porch in midsummer, but it's still cool - just very different from the rest of the album.I hope you enjoy it as much as I have over these many years. This is another awesome CD from Mr. Mullins!  These songs tell storys and offer wonderful praise and worship at the beginning with &quot;Step by Step&quot; and sums up the CD that God IS our God with the chorus of  &quot;Step by Step&quot; at the end.  The songs do kinda depend on what u  like.  But, I love it! I had purshased all of the Rich Mullins albums years ago, when he was alive making some of the greatest music that any artist has ever recorded.  Low and behold, I wanted to listen to this cd, but when I opened the case, the disc was, and is still, missing.  Couldn't go without it, so I placed an order from Amazon for another one.  I think that this is one of his best, although, I am not partial to all of the songs on the cd.  If you are a Rich Mullins fan and do not own this disc, I highly recommend that you purhase it.  You will not be disappointed.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop",touched heart many times though think new listener exploring rich mullins first personal favorite intimate compelling quot sometimes step quot always brings throne worship lyrics refreshing water spirit richs connection spiritual heart people really proven lyrics say much feel spiritual journey time favorite rm appears saddened make cut onto either two greatest hits compelations maker noses really one moments speaks spirit addresses times lives dont know lies ahead best decision make feel pulled everyones opinions comes faith christ lead us follow stirs soul whole cd worth buying one p touched heart times think new listener exploring rich rich mullins personal favorite intimate compelling quot step quot brings throne worship lyrics refreshing water water spirit spirit richs connection spiritual heart people really proven lyrics say feel spiritual spiritual journey journey time favorite rm appears cut greatest greatest hits hits maker noses really moments speaks spirit addresses times lives know lies ahead best decision feel pulled everyones opinions comes faith christ lead follow stirs soul cd worth buying
173,372,B0000004S0,"This CD is worth the price and a great one that has a lot of her hits from the past, including one that I sort of consider a pop tune that was big for her years ago.  I was going through a lot of my old cassette, ran across this particular one, played it, and told myself I had to have this on CD so I could play it in the car now.  It is worth the investment. ordered this for a friend who doesn't have a computer. It arrived in good time and she was happy with the product. I have just recently began collecting CD's by this artist.  I had heard her songs on various mixed CD's and decided to try her album.  This is one of her earlier works and she has a magical, warm voice and the songs she wrote on this album take a deep look at love, happiness, despair and joy.  I look forward to purchasing more albums by her and would recommend this CD to anyone wanting something different from a female artist. This is commercial pop rock with a real sense of passion, something missing from so many of KT's peers. It's a vocal album with a backbeat that pushes one to not so much dance but instead sing along with as much emotion as possible. It`s easy to forget that rock can really be this tender. It doesn`t hurt to have Diane Warren`s always beautiful pen in the mix. Yes, it's by a reknown Christian artist. But, KT is not singing Jesus this & Jesus that, or campfire church songs, which is how a lot of people mistakeningly label Christian music, alienating themselves with stereotypes from great music. These are songs of passion, life & the heart. KT calls them Christian songs. Other bands might just call them love ballads ... KT is no more religious than Metallica in the end. As it is, a few songs are penned by the non-Christian artist Warren, who should be as iconized as much as Bernie Taupin or Jim Steinman having written chart-topping ballads recorded by Cher (i.e. ""If I Could turn Back Time"", ""Just Like Jesse James""), Milli Vanilli (i.e. ""Blame It On The Rain""), Aerosmith (i.e. ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing""), Michael Bolton (i.e. ""How Can We Be Lovers""), Meat Loaf (i.e. ""I'd Lie For You (& That's The Truth)""), Bad English (i.e. ""When I See You Smile""), to name only a few. Right there one knows the material is strong, while KT's own pen brings out equal delight. With her strong voice, different than many female singers with a more husky tone that's often been criticized or equated to jazz not pop, the weaknesses of the album are risen over. Yes, there is a weakness in the album, but its one obvious only through hindsight, as at the time the album was considered her strongest. The music is flooded with a now dated Michael Bolton-esque reliance on synthesizers. Though, ironically, of note on the recording is Twisted Sister drummer Joe Franco, Megadeth guitarist Al Pitrelli & Shakira bassist Mark Russell, all who would soon join Dee Snider for two albums in the hard rocking Widowmaker, plus Beach Boys sax player Richie Cannato & backing vocalists Joe Lynn Turner of Rainbow & Tony Harnell of TNT. The troupe was led by producer Ric Wake & award-winning keyboardist Rich Tandredi, who helmed the same group, san Pitrelli, in crafting ""Tell It To My Heart"" for Taylor Dayne. It's no accident that the successful Dayne session group was recruited by KT. She was a backing vocalist on the album. Wake & company would appear on numerous albums throughout 1990 & 1991. Their inclusions would always be the only rock moments in heavily synthesized albums, making it a bit odd that the synthesizer would play such a prominent part here where they'd finally get a chance to do more than a track or two. Pitrelli gets a two bar solo in one song that's nearly lost & plays some rhythms tucked in the mix. The real highlight is Franco who drives the album with a strong beat, far more enjoyable than the electronic drums chosen by so many of KT's peers at this time.For those not familiar with Troccoli besides being a musican she's also an author & lecturer. She also auditioned for the role of Eva Peron for the film version of Broadway's Evita. She was obviously beaten by Madonna, but not before three call-back auditions. Pure Attraction was Troccoli's first album to wield a mainstream chart hit with the single ""Everything Changes"", peaking at 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, & marking a comeback after five years out of music.","Pop & Contemporary,Adult Contemporary,Christian,Pop",cd worth price great one lot hits past including one sort consider pop tune big years ago going lot old cassette ran across particular one played told cd could play car worth investment ordered friend doesnt computer arrived good time happy product recently began collecting cds artist heard various mixed cds decided try one earlier works magical warm voice wrote take deep look love happiness despair joy look forward purchasing would recommend cd anyone wanting something different female artist commercial pop rock real sense passion something missing many kts peers vocal albu cd worth price great lot hits past including sort consider pop pop tune tune big years years years ago old cassette ran played told cd play car worth investment ordered friend computer arrived good good time time happy product recently began collecting cds artist heard mixed cds decided try earlier works magical warm voice wrote deep look love happiness despair joy look forward purchasing recommend cd wanting different female artist commercial pop pop rock rock real sense passion missing kts peers vocal
174,373,B0000004S2,"As far as christian music goes I was very dissatisfied with this CD. I actually bought it for song #1 only and was hoping that they rest of the CD was going to be good.  Well, at least some of the songs.  I was very dissappointed.  Not very much ""glorifing God"". The songs were more like a secular song that could swing the christian way if you choose to apply the vocals that way (or visa versa). This is an unusual CD. The title track is reason enough to buy it. I love the guitar on songs such as &quot;Carolyn&quot; and especially the intro to &quot;Martin Luther.&quot; What makes this CD unusual is the combination of  excellent musicianship with the variety of issues dealt with. Mr. King  deals with all the issues admirably. He demonstrates a true grasp of what  it means to follow God. I recommend this CD. The first album by this artist and it is a good one. It starts off with &quot;I Believe&quot; which is a good praise song. The title track is also good. My favorite track is &quot;Martin Luther.&quot; It is such an inspirational song. I have two other CD's by Wes King, but this is my favorite of the bunch. I listen to it quite frequently.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Gospel,Pop",far christian goes dissatisfied cd actually bought hoping rest cd going good well least dissappointed much glorifing god like secular could swing christian way choose apply vocals way visa versa unusual cd title reason enough buy love guitar quot carolyn quot especially intro quot martin luther quot makes cd unusual combination excellent musicianship variety issues dealt mr king deals issues admirably demonstrates true grasp means follow god recommend cd first artist good one starts quot believe quot good praise title also good favorite quot martin luther quot inspirat far christian dissatisfied cd actually bought hoping rest cd good god secular swing christian way choose apply vocals way visa unusual cd title reason buy love guitar quot carolyn quot especially intro quot martin luther luther quot cd unusual combination excellent musicianship variety issues dealt mr king deals issues admirably demonstrates true grasp means follow god recommend cd artist good starts quot believe good praise title good favorite quot martin luther luther quot

176,375,B0000004SD,"Rich Mullins life and death adds credence to the overused adage, the good die young.  A Liturgy, A Legacy, & A Ragamuffin Band came out of Mullins' association with the writer Brennan Manning, who penned a book titled ""The Ragamuffin Gospel.""  Both the book and this CD show it is one thing to be tagged with the faith of one's family and quite another to find real faith.  It is a journey we are all on and Rich Mullins embraced the trek.  He died shortly after the release of this album.  This CD really sings of creation and God's love for his creation.  From the opening track HERE IN AMERICA to the closing track LAND OF MY SOJOURN Mullins, in this best of his work, conveys that journey we are all on.  The CD is a great blend of folk, appalachian sound, celtic and rock music.  All relevant to Mullins' upbringing and life, and more importantly to his musical development.  THE COLOR GREEN is just a wonderful musical prayer and one of the greatest songs of all time.  It is a shame that it is really only in the US that what is known as CCM gets put in its own musical ghetto.  This album transcends labels.  It is a wonderful musical creation. This was my first Rich Mullins CD and the springboard to my purchase of nearly all his other CD's.  What a great way to meet this wonderful artist.  It was over 14 years ago, in 11th grade, when I first became a Rich Mullins fan, and today he is still my top 3 (Prince and U2 are the other favorites).  Here In America and Land of My Sojourn are probably my favorites on this album; wonderful road trip songs also.  I cannot recommend this artist and this CD highly enough.  (I would gush effusively if I thought it would help you make the decision, but that could get annoying.) Simply put, but absolutely true. I had the supreme honor to meet Rich Mullens and go to several of his concerts. My friends and I went to volunteer at the Reservation he stayed at in New Mexico. A more humble, sincere, gifted musician I will never hope to meet. Really, you should buy all of his albums, but if you only choose one, this should be the one. I do not mourn his death, even though I miss him. He is where he most desired to be, singing songs to the One he always sang for. If you're a Rich Mullins fan and you don't own this album, all I can say is, why? In my opinion, the best thing about this man's music are the lyrics. There aren't Christian cliches in this album--it is like poetry set to music. It illustrates the magnificent beauty of God's creation, but without worshiping nature or leave you scratching your head over the meaning. And if the lyrics weren't enough, the music is. 'Peace' had beautiful piano music, and 'Creed' even has hammer dulcimer. Talk about an interesting albulm! Between the beautifu music and lyrics, this albulm is probably my favorite of all time. It might become yours.....  I agree with the other reviewer, five stars just isn't enough! This is one of the most beautiful CDs I have ever heard. Rich Mullins is the absolute master of making the instrumentals match the majesty of his lyrics. After all, he is singing about God and the greatness of creation--which are majestic things. And though I have listened to many other Christian artists sing about such things, none is as powerful instrumentally as Rich Mullins. Lyrically, he is good. There is no question about that. But the real power of his music comes in the way he combines the lyrics with the music. You really have to hear it for yourself. I love Rich Mullins' music and this album is very classic Rich Mullins!  The songs bring back the beauty of his music and remind me of a simpler time! CCM Magazine, the 20th Anniversary Issue,  described &quot;A Liturgy, A Legacy, &amp; A Ragamuffin Band&quot; as Rich Mullins' &quot;magnum opus&quot;.  One does not have to read those words to agree with the  comment.If you like well orchestrated music, incitful lyrics, and a  heart for God, then listen to this CD.  Musical talent abounds not only in  the writing but also in the instrumentation.  It is especially puncutated  by Rich's expressive voice which accentuates passion, worship, reverance,  and praise throughout this album.  It would be hard to find an artist who  could do it better. This CD has been one of my favorites for years.  Seeing it again here on Amazon brought back so much emotion and admiration that I couldn't help but add to the existing reviews.  Rich Mullins was a virtuoso, a Christian artist of depth and compassion beyond the scope of any of those who would attempt to be a peer of the peerless.  His mark is as profound as that of any composer or poet ever known. I had heard 1 or 2 of his songs, and thought I would like a whole CD. This was okay, but not as good as the songs I had heard previously. The vendor did ship quickly, and the item was in excellent condition. I love Rich Mullins heart for God, and his talent is endless.  His productions were simple and under-produced, leaving the listener with a desire to take them further in their hearts. Common opinion holds this album to be the best of Rich's superlative body of work. I have to disagree, although it comes close; I'll give The World as Best as I Remember It Volume 1 higher marks and argue that Canticle of the Plains nips on this album's heels. Nonetheless, no other album in his collection shows Rich to be more of a ... well, a modern troubador. No other album except for Canticle of the Plains shows Rich to be so haunted with questions of worship and liturgy; the question of whether to become Roman Catholic, which he had been wrestling with for some time and would continue to play out internally up to his death, seemingly is bubbling under the surface here. And, best of all, no other album contains so many works of sheer poetic genius: ""The Color Green,"" ""Peace,"" and ""Land of My Sojourn"" are his most poetic works.Rich's high ambition this time around is for the album to look at life through two prisms: liturgy and legacy. After an introduction (""Here in America"") that arguably could have been transported to the legacy section, we move into the liturgy for tracks 2 through 6. Tracks 7 through 12 then constitute the legacy section of the album.For my money, it's the liturgy section where the album really shines. Rich patterned this section after a liturgical worship service, with proclamation (""52:10""), praise (""The Color Green""), confession (""Hold Me Jesus""), creed (""Creed""), and communion/Eucharistic invitation (""Peace""). The order of service follows the order of a Roman Catholic/Eastern Orthodox/Anglican mass with one exception: the creed should come before the confession rather than the other way around. For this absentminded change, we have to thank Reunion Records, who switched the order of ""Creed"" and ""Hold Me Jesus"" without Rich's knowledge and against his wishes. (If the order had been as Rich planned, we would have had the wonderful touch of ""Hold Me Jesus'"" last line, ""Won't you be my prince of peace,"" leading directly into a song about the peace that Christ gives through the Eucharist. Memo to Reunion Records: Is there any way you can go back and correct your mistake?)And the liturgy itself produces a plethora of emotions in the listener. ""52:10"" loudly proclaims God's holiness; it leaves you awestruck and even fearful. ""The Color Green,"" one of the most wonderful pieces of poetry ever put to music, leaves you lost in awe and wonder at your creator and all that he has made. ""Hold Me Jesus"" invites you to lay down all of your pretensions and to see yourself as the ragamuffin you really are. (And, as others have noted, the ragamuffin analogy in the band's title refers to Brennan Manning's book The Ragamuffin Gospel. Manning's message of grace pervades this album from start to finish.) ""Creed"" is a joyful proclamation of belief, or better yet, a joyful proclamation of an experience of God received through belief. In this song, Rich demonstrates clearly that theology is not antithetical to experience, nor vice versa. Finally, ""Peace"" is an incredibly moving poem of reconciliation and forgiveness as offered by Christ as his children prepare to take communion.The legacy section never reaches the heights of the liturgy section, to my mind, but to be fair, it's not supposed to do so. If the dominant theme of tracks two through six is worship, the dominant theme of the remaining tracks is the difficulty of being caught between two worlds, earth and heaven. After a brief instrumental devoted to a childhood locale (""78 Eatonwood Green""), Rich gets directly to his main point with ""Hard."" This song has a curious mixture of straighforward confession and irony; you can read the speaker as either being humble or self-deceptive and proud. Most likely, Rich intends us to see the speaker as a combination of both. The need for strength continues as a theme in ""I'll Carry On,"" which has a speaker on the edge of adulthood. A complete contrast is given to us in ""You Gotta Get Up,"" which looks at Christmas from a child's perspective. We once more shift back to the opposite tack in the heavily ironic and even prophetic ""How to Grow Up Big and Strong,"" a Mark Heard tune about the false American ideals of what it means to be described with those two adjectives.The closing song, ""Land of My Sojourn,"" is the most complicated piece of poetry that Rich ever wrote and very Bruce Springsteen-esque. It serves as both the closing track for the legacy section of the album and, as it hearkens back to some of the themes from ""Here in America"" (the album's opening track), the entire album. It gives us an America of highway construction workers, lonely singles, oppressed immigrants, praying monks, and a conflicted narrator, all in one four-minute tune. It presents an America that hurts its citizens as much as it helps them, but despite that, it's still a country that the speaker calls home. At the same time, he realizes that America is not his ultimate home and wishes that he could take her with him to the far country of heaven. In the verses, difficulties and unfulfilled yearnings are contrasted with beauties and ideals. The center of the song, at least as it relates to the album as a whole, can be found in its contrast of immigrants impoverished in a nation that rewards greed with praying monks who've taken a vow of poverty. In this juxtaposition, liturgy meets legacy.Musically, this was Rich's first album with his Ragamuffin Band and his last one with producer Reed Arvin (although Arvin produced the new songs on Mullins' later greatest hits collection). The album is lush and beautiful; unlike on The World as Best as I Remember It Volume 2, Arvin hits just the right note with the strings this time. They always complement the songs and never are overdone. About the Ragamuffin Band -- well, what can you say? They are arguably the most overlooked band in contemporary Christian music, full of talent and great accompaniment to Rich. Supposedly, their version of the album before the strings were added was incredible in its own right. Still, I can't imagine the album without the strings.The reason why I can't conclude this album to be Rich's best is because the legacy section still seems greatly inferior to the liturgy section, in my opinion. Nonetheless, Rich is just about at the top of his game here. A Liturgy, a Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band is a classic album period (not just of contemporary Christian music). Anyone who appreciates excellent artistry should love it. Truly, Rich Mullins was a gifted musician, and his music still resonates today. If you want to listen to Christian music and enjoy music and depth, buy this album! What can you say when you're reviewing a disc like this? Rich Mullins, while he was amongst us, was--hands down, one of the greatest song writers to ever walk the earth. A Liturgy, A Legacy and a Ragamuffin Band is one of his stronger albums. Songs like Hold Me Jesus, Peace, The Color Green, and The Land of My Sojourn...geesh! Just get the CD. I promise its worth the money. I was channel surfing one Saturday afternoon prior to a Notre Dame Football game when I came across a music video of a guy playing some strange instrument in the middle of a field.  My wife pointed out that the insturment was a hammered dulicimer, and asked me not to flip the station.  Not knowing what a hammered dulicimer was, and more importantly, not wanting to upset my bride, I set the remote control down.  (Besides, it was only the pre-game show.)The driving beat of the song captured my attention as the familiar words of the Apostles' Creed were brought back to my memory.  (If only this song were available as I went through catechism!) After one listen, I was hooked. I decided I had to find the CD.During Christmas break, my wife and I went to a Christian Bookstore owned by her best friend's in-laws.  (I only entered Christian bookstores on Christmas Eve as a holiday tradition.) I asked the clerk if he knew what CD had a song that was essentially the Apostle's Creed set to music.  To my surprise, the clerk immediately brought me a copy of this CD.I pretty much expected the album to consist of cheesy Christian music , with perhaps the one good song.  I was pleasantly mistakened.Prior to listening to this album, I typically thought of CCM artists to be the equivalent of design imposter fragrances - &quot;If you like *NSYNC, you'll love Plus One&quot; - they actually still market some of the stuff that way.  But Rich Mullins and a Ragamuffin Band are unlike anything I'd ever heard played on the radio.  This album opened me up to the possibility that contemporary Christian music (CCM) could actually be well-crafted artistic masterpieces.This album became my favorite album in 1994, and I have yet to discover anything that compares to it.  In a collection of over 1,000 CDs, most of which are &quot;secular&quot; CDS, it remains my absolute favorite.Rich Mullins quickly became one of my favorite musicians.  I soon collected all of his music. I saw him in concert and read his writings in Release magazine.  He inspired me to deepen my relationship with Christ.  He opened me up to the possibility that CCM might not always suck.Even if you have already purchased his greatest hit collections (Songs 1 and Songs 2), I would strongly encourage you to get this CD, Rich Mullins' true legacy.

He opened me up to the possibility that CCM might not always (...).Even if you have already purchased his greatest hit collections (Songs 1 and Songs 2), I would strongly encourage you to get this CD, Rich Mullins' true legacy.  Every song on this CD is a masterpiece. There are very few songwriters of any genre who have the skills and craft of Rich Mullins, and on this album Rich surpasses even the best of his past work. Rich has the lyrical skills of a top notch poet, and his visual lyricisim and several cuts(The Color Green, Land of my Sojourn, Here in America) are among the best lyrics ever written in a pop song. This CD cuts across the full range of Rich's music...from symphonic(52:10), to the playful(You Gotta Get Up), to the Celtic folk influence of 28 Eatonwood Green. Rich and his &quot;Ragamuffin&quot; band add a dynamic live feel to the music by recording the album(except the strings) live in the studio. I could not more highly recommended a CD to anyone who loves good music. I absolutely love this CD.  If you are interested in contempory music, but also love sacred music, this is for you!  The instrumental portion is mostly accoustic and the vocal is simple and singable.  The most important thing however is how theologically significant and powerful the lyrics are.  It's great! Be praised for all Your tendernessby these works of Your hands.Suns that rise and rains that fall tobless and bring to life Your land.Look down upon this winter wheatand be glad that You have madeBlue for the sky and the colorgreen that fills Your fieldswith praiseIt would have to have been something extraordinary and (for me) quite unimaginable to come up with the lyrics that form the song &quot;The Color Green&quot;.  It reminds me that the Hands that formed more majestic sights of the earth than Ansel Adams ever had the chance to behold through a lense, still receives my prayers and praise with tenderness.Be praised for all Your tenderness.I don't think Rich Mullins wrote the song &quot;Hold Me Jesus&quot; just because he thought it would be cute and Christiany.  The lyrics,and I wake up in the night and feelthe darkit's so hot inside my soul I swearthere must be blisters on my heart,reveal the fact that Rich was going through some extremely stressful pressure of some sort.  But he also leaves the listener with some lyrics of hope when he saysand Your grace rings out so deepit makes my resistance seem so thinWhether you refer to it as violent (as Michael Card does), or sufficient (as St. Paul did), or simply amazing (as the writer of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; did), one thing is for certain: God's grace will always dwarf our resistance to it.  Fascinating, isn't it, that instead of writing an elaborate, theological song about prayer or intercession, he simply cries out the one thing that would come most naturally to a child of the Father:Hold Me Jesus!There's not a lot I understand about the song &quot;Peace&quot;.  I'm not sure who he is addressing, and I really don't know if &quot;this feast&quot; represents Christian fellowship or a feast we'll partake of in heaven or what.  In the chorus, he sings of &quot;these souls this drought has dried&quot;.  I wonder what the drought was.  Was it a &quot;falling out&quot; he may have had with another believer with whom he still longs to have fellowship with?  Or perhaps it was simply the typical complacency and ordinariness that often befalls even the closest of friendships.  Whatever his intentions behind the messages of the song, I can't help but feel compelled to make the chorus my prayer.May peace rain down from HeavenLike little pieces of the skyIf it was easy to be like Jesus, would I still want to be like Him?  Probably not.  (Don't be too shocked.  It's easy to be complacent when the task is too easy.)  I would get too complacent...even more complacent than I already am!  I admit I don't stack up too well against Peter and Paul and the apostles.  In fact, I don't even stack up too well against the average good midwestern boy.Indeed it is hard to be like Jesus.All the rest of the songs on this CD, no less than the ones I just mentioned, are full of the kind of Spirit-anointed messages that may bring a smile to the face, tears to the eyes, or perhaps a shiver down the spine. The delight of this music is that it is so brilliantly and lovingly recorded that even as someone with little faith I can enjoy the manner in whcih Mullins has made this album a prayer. Quietly understatedwhen it should be-singularly amazing when it soars and sails, A Liturgy is a beautiful, living recording that anyone cn enjoy and I'm very fortunate to have stumbled across him elsewjhere on line and found this album here. &quot;A Liturgy, a Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band&quot; is by far the best album Rich ever recorded, a true masterpiece.  I believe that this album communicates Rich's passionate love for God more than any other.  If you enjoy his music, this CD is a must-have.  Also, those who especially enjoy the songs in which Rich plays his hammer dulcimer have got to get this CD because the song &quot;Creed&quot; is one of the best songs he ever performed with this instrument.  My advice for people considering purchasing this album is DO IT, and then go buy the music video as well! This is classic Rich Mullins. Deep, moving, and powerful songs from a bunch of Ragamuffins. I highly recommend this album. Rich Mullins' testament is so earnest and thoughtful and his musicianship and sense of history so complete that his remains the only contemporary Christian music I still come back to even as partisan politics, social conservatism, and isolationism drives me away from the church in which I grew up. This album, which introduces the Ragamuffin Band that was to become yet another of Rich Mullins' great legacies, is one of Rich's best albums.  Only The Jesus Record and the Songs anthology CD are better, in my opinion.  Fittingly enough, the album begins with Rick Elias making the disclaimer  that he isn't ready to start recording but that they should begin anyway.  With that statement, Elias has captured the Ragamuffin spirit by putting  the matter in God's hands and letting Him lead the way.  The album itself  is arranged so that the opening track (the beautiful ballad &quot;Here In  America&quot;) is followed by &quot;The Liturgy,&quot; 5 songs that express  the themes of proclamation, praise, confession of sin, affirmation of  faith, and celebration of grace.  The songs &quot;The Color Green&quot;  (praise) and &quot;Creed&quot; (affirmation of faith) are two of Rich's  most popular songs, and deservedly so.  &quot;The Liturgy&quot; is followed  by &quot;The Legacy,&quot; 6 songs that speak of how our beliefs and ideals  play out in a secular society.  The songs within &quot;The Legacy&quot; all  describe normal scenes from our lives, such as children dragging their  parents out of bed on Christmas morning (&quot;You Gotta Get Up&quot;); and  they also remind us that our stay here on Earth is only temporary  (&quot;Land Of My Sojourn&quot;) and that something better awaits us.  It's  ironic that the Ragamuffins (the word refers to anything that is disorderly  or ragged) would be introduced in an album that is so beautifully  structured and organized.  What I like the most about this CD, however (as  with all of Rich's other albums), is the humility and down-to-earth tones  that these songs carry.  I think the spirit of this album - and the message  that Rich most wanted to convey to us - can be found in the refrain from  &quot;Creed&quot; - &quot;...I believe that what I believe is what makes me  what I am. I did not make it, no it is making me. It is the very Truth of  God and not the invention of any man...&quot; -  This one is definitely a  must-have for any Rich Mullins fan. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CD!! IT IS BEAUTIFUL, POETIC AND PLAYFUL.  THE MUSIC IS WONDERFUL BUT THE REAL BEAUTY LIES IN THE LYRICS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO EVERYONE WHO ENJOYS GOOD MUSIC.  I THINK EVERY CHRISTIAN SHOULD HAVE THIS CD.  IT WILL QUICKLY BECOME ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES! Rich Mullins & a ragamuffin band / a liturgy, a legacy:  This is a good album.  It is excellently performed and quite entertaining, but it is not his most memorable work.  I like this one more than love it, so I give it Fours Stars. It's just coming out on it's anniversary  and was always one of the best cd's ever recorded. Would to here someone as original as Rich. Before I listened to Rich Mullins sing, I was spiritually dead.  His music awakened feelings inside of me I never knew I could have.  In every song Rich expresses the true beauty of God and His creation.  It's like God is speaking to me through his lyrics.  At first, it seemed strange.  How could someone who I've never met be able to see so deeply into my heart?  Rich Mullins' music, especially THIS CD, is a must for anyone with hurt and sorrow.  I guarantee, you will NOT be disappointed.  But you'll have to see for yourself. I have many christian music CDs.  This one is amazing. Rich Mullins pores his soul into his music. His band is not your usual band. You can tell that they are professional musicians, as they use their talent with some orchestral flare. It is a great loss to us that God called him home so early. As a Missouri Synod Lutheran, I find this album to show an incredible understanding of true Christian doctrine.  Examples of this run through almost every song, by my favorite example is in &quot;Peace&quot;, where  Mullins upholds the true meaning of communion, even seeming to understand  that Christ's blood and body are really present in the brad and wine, and  that we indeed recieve forgiveness when we partake in this feast.It is  also refreshing to see the liturgy upheld as something of value in the  church, not just as a tradition.  &quot;Creed&quot; hits the nail on the  head, and puts to rest the idea that the Apostles creed is something made  up by man.Finally, in many of his songs, Mullins shows that we are  incapable of making one step toward Christ, that it is His power and grace  that give us faith and sustain us.An excellent album, especially for  confessional Lutherans. Rich Mullins left a big hole in the Christian music world upon his death, but his legacy lives on in this wonderful album that beautifully illustrates Christ's relationship with the Church. His lyrics captivate your heart and mind and leave you meditating on the messages he so poetically express. All of the songs on the album are terrific, and my favorites are 'Creed', an unforgettable anthem for the Church today, 'Peace', a touching song that tells Christians to reach out and show Christ's love to people, and 'Hold Me Jesus', a reflective song on how we depend on Christ's love through times of fear and doubt. It's one of the most memorable Christian albums ever because of its passionate music and lyrics that will be relevant to the Church as long as music exists. This CD is so rich lyrically! (No pun intended. Honest!) Another reviewer rightly noted that &quot;The Color Green&quot; is a huge standout in this collection. This song declares the glory of God through the observation and wonder of nature itself. Rich was wonderful at this and has made use of nature in so many of his songs. His excellence was in taking commonplace themes and making them wonderful.&quot;Hold Me Jesus&quot; and &quot;Creed&quot; are each wonderful songs that deserve mention. &quot;Hold Me Jesus&quot; is a song of refuge for those times when life leaves us, &quot;shaking like a leaf.&quot; &quot;Creed&quot; is very simply a statement of belief. It reminds us that these truths that we cling to are, &quot;the very truth of God and not the invention of any man.&quot;This CD explodes with exceptional songs. &quot;I'll Carry On&quot; is an anthem of encouragement. &quot;You Gotta Get Up&quot; has become one of those songs that just *makes* Christmas for me.Yet one of the crowning moments of this CD comes in the form of Track 6. &quot;Peace&quot; is a gentle, comforting song that takes you into the heart of Rich Mullins.&quot;Though we're strangers, still I love you,I love you more than your mask.&quot;Yes, Rich was gifted at saying things in such a special way. Take your pick. There is so much good in this disk. This is a CD that every Mullins fan must have! Oh man. The guy just gets better with age. He gets into his Apalachian and Irish roots on this one. I love anything Irish and Apalachian. He manages to put out great music and lyrics, all while giving God all the glory. He shares with us  his sojourn into exploring his roots and brings us listeners into the journey with him. Another ""must have"" for Rich Mullins fans. is amazing.  He is sorely missed in this world.  His instrumentation, soul, and love of music and love of Christ shines through. this album is quintesentially Rich Mullins.  real, truthful, thought  provoking and beautiful.  A self proclaimed simple man writing about simple  things in an inspired way.  I can only wish that the whole world could view  creation with such wonder.Rich Mullins has been called one of the CCM's  all time best songwriters and this album provides the proof.  From the  stiring hammered dulcimer on Eatonwood Green, to the observations of  something simple as &quot;The Color Green&quot;  to the tear-provoking love  and compassion that flows forth on &quot;Peace&quot; (and the most  beautiful piano...) to seeing the world thru a child's eyes on &quot;You  gotta Get up.&quot;If you like good CCM, if you like good songwriting,  and even if you have never heard of Rich Mullins, THIS IS AN ALBUM TO BUY!! There are countless reviews on Amazon.com where people claim, &quot;Oh, this is the best album ever...or this is the best album of all time.&quot; Truth be told, I believe that this is the best Christian album ever made. There is not one weak moment, thought, or lyrical oddity on this record. CCM magazine has ranked this CD the #3 Christian album of all time. I remember when Rich was touring this album and it was truly an honor to see him perform these songs. There are so many standout tracks here-but the award must go to &quot;Peace&quot;. I recall Rich saying that &quot;Land of my sojourn&quot; was his favorite. If this album doesn't move you then you are six feet under. I had never heard of Rich Mullins when a friend lent me this CD.  It took me a little while to get into the music, as it does for me with every new artist I try.  The difference with this one was the depth to the music.  So many artists crank out ""music,"" but many of them lack true conviction in the songs.  I have not found this with any of Rich's songs.The two I like most on this CD are:1) ""Hold me Jesus"" I play this song on especially hard days as a prayer to the Lord.  It is genuinely up lifting and a blessing on any day, not just the hard ones!2) ""Peace"" Holy Communion has always meant so much to me.  This song talks about laying down our masks and coming to God with each other at Communion.  When we do, we gain Peace from our Heavenly Father and He reaches down, touches our lives, and sets us free!  A very powerful and moving song.I highly recommend this CD.  It is outstanding! This has to be Rich's most thoughtful, spiritual CD of all of them.  Whenever I want a good mix/pickmeup/reminder of what it is all about and I have only about 15 minutes or so, I start with the third track of this CD  (The Color Green) and let it play through.  The Color Green describes  nature crying out praise to God -- its enough to make you an  environmentalist just to preserve the praise.  &quot;Hold Me Jesus&quot; is  a simple, tender statement that we need Jesus, &quot;you have been king of  my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?&quot;.  &quot;Creed&quot;  reminds us that we don't (or at least shouldn't) make our theology, no,  God/doctrine/creed/theology is discovered by us and making us.  The whole  CD is strong, but these three songs make it well worth the price! This is an often played masterpiece at my house. It is simply wonderful. If you enjoy Celtic music, you'll love The Color Green.  If you enjoy folk and pop, you'll love Here in America.  Bottom line, you really will probably love all the songs on this album.  Enjoy! An absolutely classic in the Christian music genre that would stand up musically and lyrically to any album in any genre.  Rich was a genius and a dedicated follower of Jesus whom we lost way too soon. &quot;Though we're strangers, still I love you. I love you more than your mask; and you know you have to trust this to be true. And I know that's much to ask-but lay down your fears, come and join this feast. He has  called us here, you and me&quot;These words from the song  &quot;Peace&quot; embody everything that is excellent in this recording as  well as the very soul of Rich Mullins' message-we are all torn, tattered  ragamuffins that are invited to the feast by the King.&quot;Peace&quot;  is probably my favorite song of all time. It not only serves as the  communion blessing on the &quot;liturgy&quot; part of this recording, it  also illustrates clearly (at least for me) the unconditional, unfailing  love of Jesus.The disc contains a lot of other great songs too:  &quot;You gotta get up&quot; catches the wonder of Christmas as seen  through the excited eyes of a child. &quot;Creed&quot; is an awesome piece  of music. If I have a second favorite song of all time, it must be  &quot;Hold Me Jesus&quot;.The whole disc is filled with wisdom, beauty  and grace. I urge you-don't take my word. Buy it for yourself. You'll never  regret it. Another one of his great works.  The concept for the liturgy just shows  his role as a church reformer and cuts through a lot of that fluff we hear  in 'christian music'.  sometimes i'll just listen to the liturgy and  worship God.  It just showed me more aspects of what worship is  about.the first song made me feel how blessed we're to be living in this  wonderful land despite all the chaos and decaying morals.  52:10 and  Eatonwood Green reminded me of Phil Keaggy's Beyond Nature.  The Color  Green is a powerful song that reveals how the entire earth including the  rocks and fields are praising God.  Hold me Jesus has one of my favorite  lyrics of Rich: &quot;I'd rather fight for something i don't really want  than to take what you give that i need&quot;.  It shows the vulnerablility  and humility that we need when we come before Jesus.  Creed is a great  proclaimation of our faith and the idea that the gospel is 'making us'  instead of human inspiration is one way to look at the argument that  christianity is just mere make believe.It did take awhile to  appreciate the legacy part of the album, but the christmas song brings back  all the nostalgic memories when i was a kid and waiting for utter  anticipation when we get to open our gifts.Overall, it's a fantastic  example of Rich's brilliant songwriting and musically talents. This is definately one of the best of Rich Mullins. Truely inspirational and you'll want to sing along for private or group worship. This album allows us a look inside the profoundly passionate heart that is Rich Mullins.  Haunting melodies, (52:10) and outstanding orchestrations are background to the straight forward, honest and scripturally based lyric content.  Each song leaves us feeling as though we must listen several times to catch the full depth and breath of its meaning.  Truly classic Mullins! I have to say that I love this album. The songs are very beautiful. My favorite songs are ""Here in America"", ""The Color Green"", ""Creed"" as well as ""Hold Me Jesus"". Absolutely fantastic music! The mid 90s produced a swag of great albums for Christian music. Albums emerged that indicated not all Christian musicians were pretenders. Some truly took the music to a higher level, one that would be expected of followers of the Creator.Rich Mullins' ""A Liturgy, A Legacy, & A Ragamuffin Band"" is a classic example of that. Revered by both mainstream Christians and the indie Christians, Mullins blends clever heartfelt tunes with engrossing dazzling arrangements. His Ragamuffin band consists of many well known names including Jimmy A on guitar and Chris McHugh, possibly the world's most innovative and talented drummer.The album is mostly split into two sections, the Liturgy (tracks 2-6) and the Legacy (tracks 7-12), with ""Here in America"" being something of a prelude. The dramatic ""52:10"" kicks off the liturgy with virtuoso drumming and irregular time signatures (and on a personal note has been sitting in my top 3 songs of all time ever since I first heard it). ""The Color Green"" keeps things moving, incorporating a Celtic influence and is another highlight of the album.""Hold Me Jesus"" is one of the more well-known songs on the album, and is a slightly more intimate affair compared with previous songs. But ""Creed"" gets things moving again with a very lively recital of the Apostles' Creed (but smoother than the Petra song ""Creed"") and displaying splashes of instruments throughout. ""Peace"" rounds out the Liturgy with guts and beauty.The Legacy, while still of high quality, perhaps doesn't quite reach the heights of the first half of the album. In a sense, the Liturgy songs have more of a legacy than the Legacy songs do. That said, there is quality music here in droves. The instrumental ""78 Eatonwood Green"" is a reminder of Rich's skills on the dulcimer. ""Hard"" and ""I'll Carry On"" are solid tunes if somewhat unspectacular compared to the rest of the album. The lowlight of the album is easily ""You Gotta Get Up,"" which feels undercooked and not on par with the rest of the album.However, the Legacy ends strongly. The cover of Mark Heard's ""How to Grow up Big and Strong"" has a neat little lyrical trick and is a fun way to build toward the end of the album. I haven't heard the original so I can't compare the two. ""Land of My Sojourn"" brings the dulcimer to the forefront again, and ties the album up well.I'm slightly inclined not to give the albums full marks due to it being slightly inconsistent. But the highlights (of which there are many) are so high that this is essential listening. This album will remain a classic and will not date quickly. It is inspired, innovative and intimate. I'm so glad I got to hear him play these songs before he passed away.  He was a great artist, and he always said the most profound things.  This is one of those albums that I love to listen to all the way through.  Sometimes I'll just listen to Peace, Creed, or Hold Me Jesus but I love to just listen to the whole thing.  It truely is his magnum opus.  ""Nobody tells you when you get born here/how much you'll come to love it/and how you'll never belong here...Hold Me Jesus/I'm shaking like a leaf/you have been my king of glory/wont you be my prince of peace/surrender don't come naturally for me/I'd rather fight you for something I don't really want then take what you give that I need."" Okay, if you're still reading my review but you haven't bought the CD yet, go buy it now, then come back and listen to what you should expect when you receive your CD.Now, then, this is an essential CD for anyone who  listens to Christian music, whether a beginner or a bitter veteran of  sifting through crappy synthesized syrup to get to something with  substance.  Rich Mullins had substance; he had so much he practically oozed  faith.  You can tell from listening to his music.&quot;Liturgy, Legacy,  Ragamuffin&quot; is simply the best album of a distinguished career cut  tragically short.  Rich outdid himself here.  &quot;Here in America&quot;  sets the tone; this is about being Christian in America, which often can be  as deadly  as its scenery is beautiful.  &quot;The Color Green&quot; is a  haunting, worshipful song about basking in the radiance of God.  &quot;Hold  Me, Jesus&quot; makes us remember who we need to turn to in times of  trouble.  &quot;Peace&quot; is a prayer for those who need it,  period.Rich never seemed comfortable in this skin, and it shows at times  in this album.  The most haunting lyric from this whole album is from  &quot;Land of My Sojourn&quot;, the last track:  Nobody tells you/when you  get born here/how much you'll come to love it and how you'll/never belong  here/so I'll call you my country/but I'll be longing for my home/I wish  that I could take you there with meYou gotta have this album if you're a  Christian who likes music.  Period. There's alot of fluff out there, and this is super!Get it!You won't be sorry!","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop",rich mullins life death adds credence overused adage good die young liturgy legacy ragamuffin band came mullins association writer brennan manning penned book titled ragamuffin gospel book cd show one thing tagged faith ones family quite another find real faith journey rich mullins embraced trek died shortly release cd really sings creation gods love creation opening america closing land sojourn mullins best work conveys journey cd great blend folk appalachian sound celtic rock relevant mullins upbringing life importantly musical development color green wonderful musical prayer one greatest time shame really us k rich rich mullins life death adds credence overused adage good good die young die young liturgy legacy ragamuffin band came association writer brennan brennan manning manning penned book titled ragamuffin gospel book cd show tagged faith ones family quite find real faith journey rich rich mullins embraced died shortly release cd really sings creation gods love creation opening america closing land sojourn best best work work conveys journey cd great blend folk appalachian sound celtic celtic rock rock relevant life importantly musical musical development development color green wonderful musical prayer greatest time shame really
177,378,B0000004SN,"I haven't known about Kathy for but a few years three I think but just on a whim I bought her self-titled CD and put it into my player in my car before I left the parking lot. As soon as I heard her voice I knew I needed  to find out if she had any other CD's out so I went right back into the  store and ordered everyone that they had listed. I have most of her CD's,  multiple copys, one set in the car, one set upstairs in the house,one set  in the basement den, and a set in the garage. I never want to be away from  hearing her voice! Her songs renewed my faith in God and have helped me  deal with the PTSD I have from my service in Viet Nam. A friend of mine's  wife went to an all womens convention here in town and she had a long talk  with Kathy, she said that Kathy was the most down to earth and personable  woman she had ever met. She also got an autographed picture that she gave  to me and it hangs in my living room. I have researched Kathy and she must  have more energy than ten people she does more volenteer work than can be  imagined. God bless Kathy Troccoli and may she keep giving us the beauty of  her voice! Some time in the early 80's I had the pleasure of listening to and then meeting Kathy Troccoli at a local church in New Hampshire. I can't remember the exact date or place but I remember the night and I have photos of myself with her to remind me.At that time she was the most exciting Christian artist I had ever heard or seen. I loved her voice, her music and her.In the years since, my life has been through serious turmoil which has now led me back to the beginning. Recently I have been searching for the Christian music of that time in my life and I was shocked to find a lot of it here at Amazon... and even more shocked to find it was DRM free. Awesome!Kathy Troccoli was a huge part of my early Christian life. The songs are beautiful and her voice is astounding. Thank you, Amazon for making these songs available to me again.Now let's see her other two 80's albums.  :-) I just wanted to say WOW. I am real happy with my CD and most of all the fast delivery. I ordered it on 4-30-09 and on 5-4-09 I recieved it. I am real happy with the service and my CD.Thank you.Elizabeth I had all of Kathy Troccoli's albums except for this one.  I have now purchased it and it was interesting to hear how her amazing voice has progressed over the years. It was also interesting to see that she started her career with Reunion Records and she has returned to them as her last two albums were also recorded by them.This collection of songs, sung by her but not written by her, show how versatile her voice is.  From the soaring sounds of 'Stubborn Love' to the soothing melody of 'It's Your love' every one of these songs are wonderful and uplifting to listen to.  My personal favourite is the last track 'The Love of My Life' which was composed by Tricia Walker, I must admit that I am not familiar with her music, but this is certainly a great song and explores Kathy's voice to it's full potential.I also found it interesting to see that Michael W. Smith co-wrote many of these songs as well as Billy Prague and Jim Weber, all great writers of lyrics and music.If you are looking for a great worshipful experience in Christian music, then this album is what you need.","Pop & Contemporary,Adult Contemporary,Christian,Pop",havent known kathy years three think whim bought self titled cd put player car left parking lot soon heard voice knew needed find cds went right back store ordered everyone listed cds multiple copys one set car one set upstairs house one set basement den set garage never want away hearing voice renewed faith god helped deal ptsd service viet nam friend mines wife went womens convention town long talk kathy said kathy earth personable woman ever met also got autographed picture gave hangs living room researched kathy must energy ten people volenteer known years think whim bought self self titled titled cd player car left parking soon heard voice knew needed find cds right store ordered listed cds multiple copys set car set upstairs house set basement den set garage want away hearing hearing voice voice renewed faith god helped deal ptsd service viet nam nam friend mines wife womens convention town long talk said earth personable woman met got autographed picture hangs living living room room researched energy people
178,379,B0000004SR,"I am a fan of Gary who believes so much in worship. I feel the Spirit behind Gary's songs, how sold-out his heart is onto God which is revealed alot in the emotion and passion that he puts into his songs. I believe he  is truely inlove with God and he happens to a mentor to me. I have always  loved his songs and his wife's and I hope they enjoy their own company too.  I long to have a wife that loves God passionatly like I do(and that  probably sings too). Keep the lights on Gary and just keep shinning.. I just love this guy's sound. He's been writing for everybody else for so long, I was really glad to see him make a solo project, and he certainly didn't disappoint me. The songs are poignant and honest, but it's his vocals that send you to the next level. Heartfelt and passionate, strong and tender at the same time, Gary knows how to communicate what's in his heart.  &quot;Give Me Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Treasure,&quot; &quot;Where are the Broken Hearts,&quot; and Love Will Be Our Anchor&quot; are a few of my faves from this set. If you love strong male vocals, coupled with tender melodies, you'll love this! Gary Chapman is one of Christian music's prime troubadors.  He sings with conviction, passion, and faith that can be shared by his audience.  There are two songs on THE LIGHT INSIDE that are so powerful and heartfelt that they still give me chills:  the stunningly beautiful TREASURE and the majestic, poignant SWEET JESUS..both songs have exquisite lyrics and simply gorgeous music.  SWEET JESUS is one of the best ""story"" songs ever.The whole album is flawless from the gospel -tinged HEAL ME to the pop sounds of FINALLY and MAKE IT RIGHT TONIGHT.If you want a Christian collection that ""walks the talk"", THE LIGHT INSIDE fills the bill. What a testament to the talent, love, and yes, transparency of Gary Chapman as a songwriter, father, and husband, (Amy really made a mistake letting this one go! And to those sceptics out there, YES, Gary Chapman's music is THAT GOOD!) His lyrical content is solidly Christian, evangelical even, yet not overly ""preachy,"" packaged in an extremely modern and pleasing sound that seems to have something for everyone; Strong gospel overtones with serious rock/country guitar rifts and musicianship with his trademark vocals and lyrics that provide serious crossover appeal (evidenced by the wide success of his smash 80's hit ""Finally"" on the country charts), but for me, his ballads and emotionally honest ""relationship"" songs take the cake, (especially on ""The Light Inside"" CD, but all his CD's I know of are excellent, including his 'Best Of' compilation ""After God's own Heart."")  Delving deeply into forgiveness, love, mercy, and what it means to be a Christian and committed to your life partner, songs such as ""Razor's edge,"" ""We can Make it Right Tonight"" and ""Give me Tomorrow"" lay bare the gritty determination all relationships require to succeed; in essence, songs tender enough to melt through even the hardest of hearts with hope, encouragement, and conviction to try again yet without being ""sappy."" Of course, for story songs with a message, ""Sweet Jesus"" really hits it out of the park, (and believe it or not this is NOT really a ""gospel"" song but has to do with a tragedy on the scale of a 9/11 from one person's perspective with a trick ending, can't say too much or I'll ruin it!). Then again, the rocking ""Floodgates of Love"" and ""Heal me"" are pretty hard to beat as well.  But should it really be any surprise coming from such a dedicated and gifted songwriter, husband, and artist as Gary Chapman?  Five stars! *****","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop",fan gary believes much worship feel spirit behind garys sold heart onto god revealed alot emotion passion puts believe truely inlove god happens mentor always loved wifes hope enjoy company long wife loves god passionatly like probably sings keep lights gary keep shinning love guys sound hes writing everybody else long really glad see make solo project certainly didnt disappoint poignant honest vocals send next level heartfelt passionate strong tender time gary knows communicate whats heart quot give tomorrow quot quot treasure quot quot broken hearts quot love anchor quot faves fan believes worship feel spirit sold heart god revealed emotion passion believe god happens mentor loved wifes hope enjoy company long wife loves god probably sings keep lights keep shinning love guys sound writing everybody else long really glad see solo solo project project certainly disappoint poignant honest vocals send level heartfelt passionate strong tender time knows communicate whats heart quot tomorrow quot quot treasure quot quot broken broken hearts hearts love anchor quot
179,380,B0000004T7,"Happy to find this for such a good price.  The CD came on time and the whole process was very good. Terrific album from Canadian singer/songwriter Carolyn Arends. If you like contemporary Christian rock with a touch of country, then I guarantee you will love this cd. She is a very talented young lady and the messages in her songs are very inspirational as well as uplifting, without being at all 'preachy'. Even non-Christians should be able to enjoy this album as the messages in them are relevant to everybody regardless of faith. Very pleased wtih every aspect of my transaction.  The product was in excellent shape, the price was right and it arrived very quickly.  Keep up the good work!! Remember Amy pre-""Age to Age""? I think about those days when I hear Carolyn's ""Reaching"" from this CD. There are also plenty of echoes of Susan Ashton's debut on this album. Arends is at her best on songs she's penned..the collaborations usually trod too close to typical CCM fare to be interesting lyrically. She also tends to be best without the big pop overkill production, though there are occasional exceptions. This debut landed ""The Power of Love"" off here in the Top 10 for Christian radio with one other hit.HIGHLIGHTS:""Seize the Day"" is a carpe diem rallying cry ""'cause life slips away like hourglass sand"". Gospelly ""Love is Always There"" is bombastic but all the production flourish helps the tune in this case. ""Reaching"" (a non-single) may well be the best tune here as Arends struggles to come to grips with the mystery of an invisible Creator. (""When we taste of the divine/It leaves us hungry every time/For one more taste of what awaits/when heaven's gates are reached"") Country jammer ""What I Wouldn't Give"" is a stark confession of a divorcee. (""I built my fortress with blood, sweat, and fears"") It's all too uncommon with CCM but at a time when countless marriages are failing (inside the Church and outside it) it's a message that's needed. The subtle ""All is Well"" is an update of standard ""It is well with my Soul"" for the 21st century.LOWS:""This is the Stuff"" is a fairly cliched ""stop and smell the roses"" song that we've heard before with more telling details. It's also WAY too overproduced. A song about celebrating simplicity shouldn't be full of every pop bell and whistle in the world. ""I Can Hear You"" is fairly ordinary..and of course was a big Christian radio hit (#13).BOTTOM LINE:While it's too produced to qualify as ""folk"" like some are inclined to say, a lot of this stuff is decent acoustic pop. Fans of early Amy Grant, Susan Ashton, and Kim Hill will probably like this.3 1/2 stars I bought this CD for the song Seize the Day and discovered that the rest of the CD is equally great.  Her style is contemporary christian and she has a great voice.  Very easy on the ears to listen to.  You won't be  disappointed with this choice. &quot;I Can Hear YOU &quot; is a classic cd.  I constantly have this cd in my changer and I have had the cd for over two years and I still love it. Definitely will put a smile on your face and my children start singing  along with the postive messages of the songs Like many teenagers, Christian music bothers me.  I recently identified why: most Christian artists simply don't have anything to say.This is also a problem in secular pop, but many secular artists, especially rock artists, really have a message to convey, often a deep and profound meaning.  Creed is a great example.  On the other hand, most Christian artists really only say &quot;Jesus is good!  Rah rah rah!&quot; and leave it at that, leaving the listener unsatisfied, no matter HOW good their music is.Enter Carolyn Arends.  Every song in this fantastic album conveys a message.  Her lyrics are fresh and not at all worn out, like a typical Christian artist is.  The songs are profound, uplifting, and spiritually envigorating, and on top of it all, it's darn good music.Besides, the first verse of Seize the Day is practically about me :) Carolyn Arends' ""I Can Hear You"" still has a good feel a decade after its release.  She has an expressive voice and sets your toe tapping on songs like ""This Is the Stuff"" & ""I Can Hear You.""  ""Alter of Ego"" is a catchy ditty about taking ourselves seriously, ""I need a touch of love, I need a thrust of grace, a push, a shove, a slap in the face.""  ""The Power of Love"" is delightfully catchy with Carolyn's smooth vocal delivery, ""Nations, your raging must cease; Listen, the Prince of Peace is calling those with hearts to hear to rise up in His name where once there was fear.""  ""You Take My Soul By Storm"" is another catchy pop melody that packs a powerful punch.  ""What I Wouldn't Give"" has a bluegrass flavor and sets your toe tapping.  ""I Can Hear You"" is a very sweet spiritual elixir.  Enjoy! I first heard Carolyn Arends in 1995. I was thirteen years old, and in desperate need of some direction. Music, I believed, was my calling, but writing songs really wasn't a strong suit of mine. I was immediately drawn in by her very first radio single, ""Love is Always There,"" and shortly thereafter discovered perennial hit ""Seize the Day"" on the 1995 Reunion Records sampler Music You Can Believe In. (OH, and like a previous reviewer, I also believed the first verse of ""Seize the Day"" was about me!)I didn't actually buy the CD until I found it in a pawn shop around 2000 or so. By then, Carolyn had released a few more albums and I'd grown a little more in my musical journey, but I still had much to learn. The lyrics on this CD are amazing, all telling a clever story with rhymes and metaphors that are any word-lover's paradise...all sung in such amazing sincerity. You can tell that Carolyn truly embraces what she writes about. She believes it. She lives it. She really means it...which is the most powerful gift that a singer/songwriter can offer their audience, I believe.There is not a track on this CD that is in any way lacking. They're all masterfully composed, beautifully performed & thought provoking to this day. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to go a little deeper than the standard Christian pop fare. This is a woman with something to say, and lyrics that don't just hook - they impale. I usually dont buy debut albums. Most seem to have a not finished appeal to them. And some just dont have any good and well written songs on them. But here is something different. A debut album with massive production and deep down bright and well written songs. I first heard Carolyn's I can hear you when I was round my Auntie's place. She told my Dad you would like this Cd and so Dad took it and then I heard it when I came home one day. The most awesome song that struck me right between the eyes was the brilliant &quot;You Take My Soul By Storm&quot; and to this day this is my fav song of Caz's! The other amazing standouts are the lovely quiet &quot;Reaching&quot; and the brilliant marriage orientated &quot;Home Fires Burning&quot;. The best heavier song has to be &quot;The Power Of Love&quot; amazing dulcimer and guitar on this song! ALl in all a fantasy starting album that to me has an out of this world feel! Carolyn is destined for a great future!","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop",happy find good price cd came time whole process good terrific canadian singer songwriter carolyn arends like contemporary christian rock touch country guarantee love cd talented young lady messages inspirational well uplifting without preachy even non christians able enjoy messages relevant everybody regardless faith pleased wtih every aspect transaction product excellent shape price right arrived quickly keep good work remember amy pre age age think days hear carolyns reaching cd also plenty echoes susan ashtons debut arends best shes penned collaborations usually trod close typical ccm fare interesting lyrically also tends bes happy find good price cd came time process good terrific canadian singer singer songwriter songwriter carolyn carolyn arends arends contemporary christian christian rock rock touch country guarantee love cd young young lady lady messages inspirational uplifting preachy christians able enjoy messages relevant regardless faith pleased aspect transaction product excellent shape price right arrived quickly keep good work remember amy age age think days hear carolyns reaching cd plenty echoes susan ashtons debut arends best penned collaborations usually trod close typical ccm fare interesting lyrically tends bes
180,382,B0000004TH,"Perhaps the most lush of all his recordings, Michael W. Smith's 'I'll Lead You Home' is full of promise and invitation.  With powerful vocals as usual, the orchestrations are formidable without getting mushy.  As a lyricist, he is able to pull out all the stops.  Taking on subjects such as crises of faith and racial strife, he goes for each listener's heart by extolling us to seek consolation, healing, and meaning from our heavenly source.Much like Joel Osteen as a preacher, Smith has the perceptive wisdom to illuminate that our hearts are wounded in life's ordeals and need some perspective to sort things out.  We are cajolled to continue as weary pilgrims on the title track; then encouraged not to lose heart on the truly ethereal ""Calling Heaven"".  Truly effective, he has the goods to diagnose the problem with existence (""Cry for Love"") and relationships (""Breakdown"").  Then, he offers heavenly consolation (""I'll Be Around"" and ""Someday"")  Yet, once he presents an understanding God, he presents praising the Lord as our ultimate remedy (""As It Is in Heaven"" and ""Crown Him with Many Crowns"")  As is typical of Michael W. Smith, he leaves his congregation with a message that comes from God in the first person (an attribute he takes on so well with the inspirational invitation of ""I'm Waiting for You"").Easily, the instrumentation of 'I'll Lead You Home,' could have become too formulaic, but Smith's ability to create a breadth of music as well as his wealth of understanding of the wounded human heart, give the C.D. a substantative healing experience without becoming muzak to our ears. Michael W. Smith (also called Smitty by his fans) has become one of the most enduring Christian artists, putting him with such company as Stephen Curtis Chapman and Bryan Duncan. This 1995 release has Smitty's fingerprints all over it, bringing us his usual mix of pop songs and musical interludes.Each of the 14 tracks on this album clearly show where Smitty's heart is: pointing to the Lord. The wide range of messages found on this album will result in one or more of them hitting the heart of all who listen.His most popular album since his 1990 effort, &quot;Go West Young Man,&quot; this CD is a must for all Smitty fans and a good one to start with for those who have never heard of him before. I continue to enjoy this album. There are so many songs on this album that  speak about the social problems in our world today. Michael's wonderful  piano playing so obvious in this record and you'll enjoy this album. This  is the first album I am really aware of where Michael has used symphony and  piaono significantly in his music. This is the first album where his music  has really matured to attract adults rather than younger teens. What is  nice is now all those teens who enjoyed his earlier works are now grown up  and enjoying his newer music including this hit album! I know because I am  one of them. I've skirted in and out of spirituality, and this album has always inspired me, and if nothing else, served as quality entertainment. The vocals are improved over Smith's past works, and there seems to be more production to his sound. If you're looking for a CD with more than one good song, this is a great choice - there are numerous songs that have become favorites of mine, and they are all highly powerful songs you can connect with. This album was my first exposure to the music of Michael W. Smith, and it had a tremendous impact on me.  Though I love all of his work, ""I'll Lead You Home"" with remain my favourite offering.Michael's music can nourish even the most barren soul - his beautiful songs about love, forgiveness and redemption bring hope to what sometimes seems like a lost world.  His Trilogy in particular has touched me greatly ... in ""He Breathes in Me"", I can almost feel the Breath of Life mingling with my own.  What an awesome experience!I highly recommend this album. This Michael W. Smith CD has been out for awhile and I lost my first copy, but found it again on Amazon. It is a great CD. I especially lovethe cut that mixes Martin Luther King's voice to the song. It is very inspirational! You need the CD to round out your collection! Cry For Love is certinly one of the best songs Michael W. Smith has ever written. I'll Be Around is stunning!  And I'll Lead You Home is Great! Someday is really good too! The only thing that keeps this album from  getting 5 stars is the second side. It is a sleeper. I don't like any of  the songs on the second side. This album is a lot like the This Is Your  Time album. ...P>I Found Michael W. Smith music wen I get back to the way of the Lord a couple of years ago. Later, I bought all his musical work. This is one of the best MWS works because it contains songs that maybe you don't all the message at first sight, Take for example Brakdown, Waiting for you, Straight to the heart +I'll lead you home. At that time you become aware that we are in presense of a master musician...like Michael O'Martian. A month ago I got the blessing of getting O'Martian's masterpices, White Horse and Adam Again after looking for them about ten years.....When you talk about O'Martian, you have to remember that he work closly with Brian Eno....Smith chose to serve the Lord and I'm happy with that.....If you got this CD you won't be desappointed..... I own many of Michael W. Smith's albums and am familiar with almost all of them.  I would have to put this on the short list of my best albums.There are many tracks that I absolutely love.  ""Cry for Love"" is a solid start and ""As It Is in Heaven,"" ""Someday,"" and the title track are outstanding.  But the high point of the album is the Trilogy, Tracks 8-10.  I think that all three of those songs are musically beautiful and lyrically powerful.  Quite honestly, the Trilogy is worth the price of the album.  And it concludes with several other good songs, like ""Calling Heaven"" and ""I""m Waiting for You.""I would never accuse Smith of having a glorious voice.  However, I consider him to be the most brilliant songwriter of modern Christian music and a wonderful musician.  This album is a true testament to his remarkable gifts.  I listen to it often and recommend it to anyone. &quot;I'll lead you home&quot; is a wonderful CD to add to any collection.  I like all of the songs on here mainly because of the spiritual lyrics.  MWS gives a variety of music so you don't get bored with the everyday  Christian music.  He's a great producer/songwriter/singer and I think you  will love this CD! These songs have had my heart singing for some odd reason now I can't help but be overjoyed by this one! This is a wonderful album full of great songs to bless. This cd is great listening for anyone and anytime. I've been raised on Michael W. Smith since I was a baby and this is by far one of his best and one of my big favorites.""I'll Lead You Home"" (track 7) is beautifully written to where the melody and music to it just matches the words perfectly. Good songs should remind you of poetry, where the music and the words rhyme together. This song pulls that off really smoothly.The next three tracks are beautifully braided together. ""Other Side of Me"" is one of the most sweet and romantic songs I've ever heard.""Breathe in Me"" is very deep and desperate in how it calls for God's help, but at the same time, humble and quiet. This is a great song for quiet time or prayer time, or when you just want to think.""Angels Unaware"" reflects the same mood of the previous two, (remember, it is a trilogy) but it calls us to consider what we watch ourselves and think about what only God knows. But even though the trilogy's song's subjects change, the mood stays the same but fits each one in it's own way.""Crown Him with many Crowns"" is for those of you who like big black church choirs. It's interesting, too, because you've got one little white boy (Michael) in a sea of African-American choir people, and it's still great.Altogether, it is definetely worth the buy and it's simply fantastic. Any MWS fan needs this album. This album was the first MWS CD I ever got. I loved it so much that since then I have boughten nearly all of his works.  Personally I don't know how anyone could say his voice is not good. He has amazing talent in that area as well as unbelievable song-writing skills....  I think my all time favorite on the album- and possibly my favorite of all his songs- is I'll Be Around. I not only love the tune... But also the words which encourage me every time I hear it. I have had the sort of life when I was never quite sure of what was around the corner. My parents were missionary's in Thailnad for nine years and then my mom got cancer and we had to come back to America.... so this song really grounded me and kind of told me that no matter what- God is there and someone will 'be around'...  All in all this album is the best work of Smitty's besides Live the Life and This is Your Time.... If you don't have it- get it. Its pop at its best- and a wonderful starter if you have never heard any of MWS music before!!!! Somewhere around Hickory, NC on August 10, 1998, i was going on my first trip with out Church's youth group and this album got played. Never heard ANYTHING from Contemporary Christian Genre, but I loved this. ""Cry For Love"" starts off the album with the energy of a big race starting (actually the lyrics mention a race car going for the wall at the speed of sound) andThen there's ""Breakdown"", the most striking indictment of our Countries' Moral State I've heard (Our Founding Fathers left a noble legacy, LOOK at what we've done...If We say that we are FREE, who will believe us?)From there, the album slows a bit, 'til you get to ""Someday"" that is almost certainly my favorite song from this Genre. Michael throws out every problem from that era (and yes the references to ""The Kennedy Conspiracy, The Trial of O.J."" seem a bit dated now) then says (in my own words) ""It's a crazy life, but someday Jesus comes back and sets everything right!"" But honestly this songs' best trait is the energy of it's two verses (I set a speed record on my bike listening to thsi once)In contrast the next song ""I'll be around"" is cool, but slower. I'm not sure if he's singing from Jesus' perspective (ala ""I Know All About Scars"" from Stories (which I have no problem with) or jsut as another friend....but VERY uplifting for wanyone whose stumbled on this straight and narrow way. well those are my Fav.s from this album, Very Good Effort from Michael though I think his best work was on ""Freedom"" (probably jsut my taste in music thoguh) Michael W. Smith has a gift that he unabashedly shares with his listener.  He is an excellent songwriter, this CD is fabulous.  'Breakdown' sends chill up my spine with the interwoven MLK speach and powerful delivery.  Yes, some may consider it preachy, but I believe in it!  I loved it!! Great CD!  Michael W. Smith's music is inspirational and always relaxing to hear!  I have enjoyed everything he has done - and the best part is all songs, on all CDs are usually phenomenal! &quot;As It Is In Heaven&quot; &amp; &quot;Crown Him with Many Crowns&quot; takes classic &quot;hymn&quot; lyrics and weaves them into today's contemporary music in outstanding fashion.  A true and excellent  meeting of old with new. Great songs. I have enjoyed listening to this CD. Hope you enjoy it too! What more can I say than that? I first had the cassette version of this album ,but it started getting old and my cassette player wasn't working well. So I bought the CD recently. I am amazed at this singer's ability to lead people to Christ by his music and his voice! After all, Smitty is my number one all-time fave male singer, and this CD proves what he actually does as an amabassador for God. I love the trilogy hits, especially &quot;The Other Side of Me&quot;. This song is a beautiful tribute to his wife, Debbie. The songs, &quot;I'll Lead You Home&quot;, &quot;I'm Waiting For You&quot;, &quot;I'll Be Around&quot;, and &quot;As It Is In Heaven&quot;, are just some of my huge faves! Overall the album proves that Smitty has made an incredible impact on the lives of music fans, believers and nonbelievers alike! There are few albums which I listen to without skipping a song here or there.  In a lot of cases, I just put it down to personal taste.  But this is one of the few that I enjoy from start to finish.  Not just a favorite from Smitty, but a favorite among all my CD's. This is a beautiful thoughtful album that every Christian should be able to apprieciate. It is artisically great, musically blissfull, and lyricaly bold and evangilistic.That said, this is surely Michael's weakest offering. I have about seven, and this is my least favorite. I'll Lead You Home is a nice transition for Michael W. Smith from his more upbeat cds targeted more towards younger listeners.  While I have enjoyed his other cds, I particularly enjoyed this one.The collection contains more reflective songs appropriate for Christian meditation.  My personal favorites include:  Crown Him With Many Crowns, Calling Heaven, I'll Lead You Home, The Other Side of Me, Breath In Me, Angels Unaware, and I'm Waiting for You.While the above are my favorites, the other songs are good also.  All in all, a highly recommened buy!  Buy and enjoy! This was a good buy.  I enjoy Michael W. Smith when there are no more CD's available by Steven Curtis Chapman, Dallas Holm or Michael Card who are awesome musicians and composers of scriptural songs This is some of the most touching music from an absolutely wonderful artist.  When I first heard this album I was disappointed in Michael W. Smith for putting out such a low key collection.  After all the pre-release hype I thought I had gotten ripped off.  It wasn't until much later, and I was a few years older that I could truly appreciate this album for the beauty that inside.  Give this album a shot.  If you don't like it wait a few years and try it again.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Hello. This Cd is good. I like his musical landscape. The songs are great and encouraging. This is the most laid-back cd in the Smith catelog. Granted, Cry for Love is a nice power-anthem, and the gospel-anthem take on Crown Him With Many Crowns hits a near-perfect groove.  But in between is some seriously more  poignant work. The &quot;angels&quot; suite is so beautifully aching that  it can be hard to listen to, and yet it demands that you stop whatever  you're doing and pay attention. If you prefer the kickier poppier sound of  MWS, this cd may disappoint, or at least seem to drag a bit, but it  definitely has its rewards. This is the best Album of Smitty's yet. It has everything. &quot;Straight To the Heart&quot; really touched me. I also like &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;I'll Be Around&quot;, &quot;I'll Lead You Home&quot;, &quot;A Little  Stronger Everyday&quot;, and &quot;I'm Waiting For You&quot;, which is the  perfect closing song. Add this one to your collection! This was one of the first cd's I bought ever. It was also the reason why I nowadays own about 11 or 12 cd's from 'Smitty'.From the 1st to the very last note it has devotion written all over. I would call it a masterpiece, nothing less. At times you feel like listening to real gospel (like a black gospel style Crown him with many Crowns)  while at other times it is like you are listening to filmmusic.It is difficult to put in writing but I ll try. Smitty uses a complete orchestra at times. It makes me shiver each time I listen to the cd.The whole cd is centered around 3 key pieces: ""The other side of me"", ""Breathe in me"" and ""Angels"". It is like one piece of about 15 minutes in which the 3 actual songs are knit together by absolutely fabulous filmlike music. Keywords: let me take you by the hand, lead you to the promised land and trust Him with your heart: He'll lead you home. That is what this cd is about.Personally I think this is cd full of strong lyrics, to which everyone stuggling with life and searching for God can relate.  The music, like I said, is fabulous if you are into a combination of filmmusic and pop/rock. For me it really comes together in the last song. After the blackgospelparty in Crown Him with many Crowns, comes a song that echoes in your mind for minutes after the cd has stopped playing. I'm waiting for you is really quiet like a breeze after a big storm, but the words to me are so powerfull. It is like God standing there, holding out his arms, saying: I did my part. Are you gonna come home? I realize we don't all have the same taste, but after reading a couple of reviews I had to add my thoughts. Saying that Change Your World is better than I'll Lead You Home is like sayin Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is better than Citizen Kane. Change your World had Give it Away and the remake of Friends and not much, if anything, else I liked. The only part that I didn't care for at first,on I'll Lead You Home, is the Trilogy and that grew on me; although the third part(Angels Unaware) didn't have to grow on me at all. My other favorites by him are Go West Young Man and Live the Life. I would give them both five stars but they're not quite as good as this one. Give it a listen and the chances are you'll like it too. This is a magnicent recording. Some have complained that the second side is slow and boring. In my opinion, the second side contains the best parts of the set. The trilogy is absolutely beautiful, and definitely my favorite  out of all of his recordings. The lyrics and orchestrations for the songs  in this collection are truly commendable. My only misgiving is that some of  the musical transitions and introductions are a bit too lengthy, which may  be what leads some to brand the songs as boring. Still, this album has a  permanent spot on my all-time favorites list. Nothing MWS does is bad, and this CD is no exception. However, it isn't one of his better ones. Cry for Love is good, and the Crown Him with Many Crowns is absolutely great. If you don't mind picking up a CD for what (I think) amounts to 2 really good tracks, 3 decent ones, and the rest worth skipping, then by all means get this CD. It, of course, belongs in any serious MWS fan's collection. But if you are really wanting solid MWS quality track after track, then Change Your World and This is Your Time fit that bill better.UPDATE: Of course, there is no accounting for tastes and I respect RichFL's right to like this album over Change Your World, but I had to correct one erroneous point: Change Your World had much more than RichFL let's on (i.e. only 2 good tracks): in fact, all tracks are solid. Picture Perfect is comparable to Cry For Love -- upbeat and a great message. Add to that Cross of Gold (one of MWS's favorite all time songs he wrote), Love One Another, and Colorblind (among the rest) and you have a truly great CD, which in all honesty is better than I'll Lead You Home. But hey, buy them both and you decide.So, while I am glad that so many like I'll Lead You Home, my only point is that if you don't have many MWS CDs and you felt a little lukewarm about this CD (like I did), there are many more quality CDs that MWS offers. Listening to &quot;I'll lead...&quot; started my interest for CCM. Not only is the melodies fabulous, these lyrics have been and still are food for my personal growth. Many of my friends would deffinitly agree.  So, if your into good music, buy it! If your into good music and lyrics that make sense, buy it! This is definately one of my favorite albums of Smitty's.  Much better that some of his earlier work. People that said it was a bore obviously didn't pay attention to the words. I'll lead you home is a fresh CD from the heart of Michael W Smith.  Tracks like &quot;Cry for Love&quot; in this cruel world are destined to speak to your soul.  But the theme song, &quot;Ill lead you home&quot; is excellent!Would I buy it after i've listened to it? Yes! This album shows Michael as a very different musician than we saw when he debued over a decade before. This album has many slower songs with orchestral accompanyment. However, the man is still a musical poet. These  lyrics are probably more geared to an adult audeince than a teen one, but  is still a great album.","Pop & Contemporary,Adult Contemporary,Christian,Pop",perhaps lush recordings michael w smiths ill lead home full promise invitation powerful vocals usual orchestrations formidable without getting mushy lyricist able pull stops taking subjects crises faith racial strife goes listeners heart extolling us seek consolation healing meaning heavenly source much like joel osteen preacher smith perceptive wisdom illuminate hearts wounded lifes ordeals need perspective sort things cajolled continue weary pilgrims title encouraged lose heart truly ethereal calling heaven truly effective goods diagnose problem existence cry love relationships breakdown offers heavenly consolation ill around someday yet presents understanding god presents praising lord ultimate reme lush recordings michael michael w smiths smiths ill lead home full promise invitation powerful vocals usual orchestrations formidable mushy lyricist able pull stops subjects crises faith racial strife listeners heart extolling seek consolation healing meaning heavenly source joel osteen osteen preacher smith perceptive wisdom illuminate hearts wounded lifes ordeals need perspective sort things continue weary pilgrims title encouraged lose lose heart heart truly ethereal calling heaven truly effective goods diagnose problem existence cry love relationships breakdown offers heavenly consolation ill someday presents understanding god presents praising ultimate
181,385,B0000004TR,"This album has the upbeat songs to give you the fight to get through a day you don't want to face, and the slower, healing songs when your heart is about to break. Rich Mullins' ministry through music has helped me through more than one crisis. I only wish God had left him with us longer. When I got this I couldn't stop listening to it till it was finished. It has all of Rich's hits and some hidden gems from his song collection also. A must for anyone looking to have an excellent Christian CD, or for any fan of Rich Mullins his best compilation of songs yet. This is such a complete CD. It has over an hour of the very best Christian music ever laid to track. From the impressive SING YOUR PRAISES TO THE LORD to the final cut it is a masterpiece. The lyrics are both poetic and challenging. The songs on this CD bring so many memories! This CD is a tresure. With each song that plays we are reminded of the power and love of God. Rich Mullins may be singing at the feet of Jesus but I thank the Lord that we have the music he left behind. This CD calls me to worship and self inspection. I am sure it will do the same for you! By the music industry standards, Rich Mullins had a long and illustrious career of 15+ years. To his millions of fans, he had a very short career, which ended when God called Rich home in September, 1997.Whether or not you think Rich Mullins' career was long or short, few could argue that he created songs that resonated with his fans. To this day, many Christian radio stations play more Rich Mullins songs than just about any other artist.Included in this ""best of"" collection are such hits as:""Sing Your Praise To The Lord"" - written in 1981 by Rich, this song has the distinction of being the first hit of two different artists: Rich and Amy Grant.""Awesome God"" - considered by most Rich fans as being his best song ever, thousands of contemporary praise & worship churches around the world now include this song in their rotations. In addition, many of today artists, including Michael W. Smith, have recently re-recorded this song for their albums.""Sometimes By Step"" - many contemporary praise & worship churches have also included the chorus to this song in their rotations.""Creed"" - one of the most straight forward holy-trinity songs to ever be recorded""We Are Not As Strong As We Think We Are"" - few people have listened to this song and not fallen down on their knees asking God to forgive them for thinking we could live our life on our own""Screen Door"" - one of my personal favorites, this is the ""radio version"" that was released for airplay back in the late 80s (which was much better than the actual album version). You can generally count on this acapella song ending up in the top 20 of any listener compiled ""top 100"" list.""Boy Like Me / Man Like You"" - re-recorded by Geoff Moore in his 1999 self-titled solo album, Rich Mullins first recorded this favorite in 1991.""Alrightokuhhuhamen"" - written in 1989, this is a extremely fun song that has a great message. Another one of my personal favorites.""Verge of a Miracle"" - recorded in 1986, this song is the first memory of Rich Mullins that I have. His biggest hit before ""Awesome God"" two years later.If you are looking for an album that will give you a wide view of the talent God gave Rich Mullins, this is the one to get. This album has been on my play list since 1997 (that year, this was the only album I listened to)...and even all these years later, it continues to inspire and provoke. Those who struggle along the road, yet have their steps filled with grace, will find much to take away from this album. Tracks like ""Awesome God"", ""We Are Not as Strong as We Think We Are"", ""Calling Out Your Name"" ""Hold Me Jesus"" remind us of peace in the midst of struggle. However, this album is not depressing in any way. The upbeat ""Creed"", ""Alrightokuhhuhamen"", and ""Boy Like Me"" will be sure to bring a smile to your face. I honestly can say this is my favorite CD. Ever. ALWAYS A RICH MULLINS FAN I ENJOY THE DEPTH AND UPBEAT STYLES OF HIS SONGS THAT ARE SO SIMPLE ANYONE CAN UNDERSTAND.THE WHOLE BAND IS SO VERY MUSICALLY TALENT; I COULD LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER (AND I DO).  HE ADDED A PERSONAL TOUCH TO EACH SONG HE WROTE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE. Every song on this album can stand on it's own.  So many CD's have 2-3 good songs...the one's played on the radio, and the rest are only half as good if you're lucky.  Each song on this album could hold its own as a single. I especially like Screen Door.  Very true!Buy it! This album has nearly all my favorite Rich Mullins songs in one place, and includes the haunting ballad, ""We Are Not As Strong As We Think We Are,"" which is found nowhere else. I had a CD of this for years and gave it away to a friend who was new to the faith. I couldn't live without these songs for long, though, so I bought the album on the MP3 store. Now, I have it with me everywhere I go. Excellent collection. Rich Mullins is the best there ever wasHe was way ahead of his time and I wonderwhat he would be producing if he was still here.What else can I say... Over the years, Christian has managed to creep (thankfully) into rock, pop, and every other music type imaginable.  But no Christian music album can beat this Rich Mullins album.  The music on this is so &quot;awesome&quot; (no pun intended)!The majority of these songs are excellent, including &quot;Alrightokuhuhamen,&quot; &quot;Creed,&quot; &quot;Sing your Praise to the Lord&quot; and Mullins's much-loved &quot;Awesome God.&quot;  The last song being my favorite, Rich knew how to make a song GOOD.  This song has classic and Godworthy written all over it.  Usually it takes me at least 3 listenings to attach to the song; here, it was no contest.It's a shame, though, that the Lord took Rich away from us.  His music, however, will NEVER be forgotten... and they will prove how glorious God is.  Amen, Rich. Our God is an awesome God, He reigns from Heaven above, with wisdom, glory, and power, our God is an awesome God.This has got to be one of the truly blessed songs every written.  Rich Mullins wrote nearly all his  own songs, probably wrote them all.  And he died tragically, I believe in a  car accident on his way to a Christian concert.  I believe the world lost a  wonderful talent when Rich Mullins died.  His &quot;Songs&quot; CD has some  of the most wonderful and powerful songs about Jesus and His Father that  I've ever heard.  This album should be a must for every Christian's library  of CDs. This is a classic collection of everyone's favorite Rich Mullins songs!  All the classics, favorites, and award-winners.  Makes you miss him even more! This cd is another masterpiece by Rich Mullins. He is a terrific songwriter. I bought this cd several days ago and would consider it one of the best five in my collection. He died in 1997, but I am not surprised that his songs are still in regular rotation on my local Christian radio stations, or that there are several Christian singers like Rebecca St. James and Amy Grant that have remade his songs. I have a hard time saying what my favorite song on this cd is, but &quot;Elijah&quot; is a possibility.  He was never a singer that could have been a crossover artist, or even mistaken for one.  His lyrics are thoughtful and God-centered. If you are looking for the &quot;just right&quot; sound in Christian music. This is the one for you, many of the songs are devoted to worship with the lord. Other songs contemplate things we should have thought about all along. This is my favorite Christian CD and is one you must have! When I bought this CD, I was just starting to explore contemparary Christian music.  It was one of the first Christian CDs that I purchased, and it is still my favorite.  Rich's songs are poignant without being caught up in the Church jargon and cliches that are problematic to most Christian music.  His influences range from Celtic to Folk, but the blend comes out as a unique style.  His voice might remind you of a more articulate Bob Dylan or a higher pitched Springsteen.  His writing is second to none; if you want real insight through lyrics, you will find it here.  Mullins was supremely gifted as a songwriter and a painter of words.  There aren't many times when I am driving under a full moon at night when I don't think of the line from &quot;Calling Out Your Name&quot; that says &quot;the moon moved past Nebraska and spilled laughter on them cold Dakota hills,&quot; or when I look up at the stars &quot;Sometimes I think of Abraham, how one star he saw had been lit for me.&quot;  If you want a different perspective on Christ, the Bible, or just life in general, this CD will help to provide that for you.  If you are tired of musicians and artists, whether secular or religious, that are caught up in their own status and who feed off of their own intellectualism, this is the CD for you.  In fact, I would say that this CD would have as much appeal for non-Christians who are curious about God as it would for saints who have walked with God for years.  As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing else like Rich Mullin's music.  It is the perfect blend of lyrical artistry and musical craftsmanship, all placed in harmony to tell about the theme of God's love to man. I came late to Rich Mullins. Faced with a new commute-from-hell, I asked my priest for advice on music to help me. I'm in Human Resources and I hoped to find something to help deliver me at the other end with any desire to serve my fellow man/employee. On her recommendation, I looked Rich up and settled on ""Songs"" to start. I have since joined the chorus of those who claim him as the voice of a generation. From ""we are not as strong as we think we are"" to ""Hold me Jesus"", this man spoke for me and to me. ""You can't see yet where it is you're heading but one day you'll see the face of love..."" I was in a meeting recently where we were asked to identify our spiritual heroes. There are many, but at that time, the first one that came to mind for me was Rich Mullins. I explained, in my small group, that it was sad he had died so young, that it seemed impossible such a spirit could be silenced. One of our group, who had never heard of him, challenged me to remember that as long as his words live on through those of us who he spoke to, his spirit will live on. And to that (and this), I say Amen. This is my favourite album by a long shot and I've had it for several years now. During his short life Rich Mullins managed to get right to the heart of God, and shows it through this album and his others.  Besides being full of exceptional musical talent, this album is the most scripturally founded album I have heard. Most of all it challenges, inspires, teaches and, in times of need, it comforts with the Word of God. are the scriptures themselves.  Rich Mullins is one of few - and the best at it - of Christian songwriters who manage to convey an honesty about their relationship (the good and the bad) with God, and really makes you believe without doubt that he knows God.  The songs are so obviously not about Rich Mullins... there is no hint of self in the production of this album.His songs (inspired by the Lord himself)- aside from just being phenomenal - are inspiring, uplifting, and insightful.My favourite lyrics:If I stand let me stand on the promise that you will pull me through;And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to you.Oh, and in case I didn't mention Rich Mullins playing the hammer dulcimer... it's just superb. It is hard to describe the brilliance that is inherent within the songs on this collection album.The music and lyrics carry with it multiple levels and dimensions that would challenge and move us in a way that is  probably a reflection of how Rich Mullins felt with God inspiring and  working through his heart and mind. Hearing the songs over and over, it is  like peeling layers of an onion, and you feel like you are listening the  songs with new ears.The songs will move a person to awe and wonder, and  to a sense of yearning, both in tears and laughter. If that is not God  breathing his spirit through the songs, then nothing is.Pure brilliance.  God inspired. Nothing could be closer to this truth. We've listened to this album over and over again on tape, we never get tired of the songs! Lost the tape so now have the CD. Highly recommend it! What a wonderful cd!I simply cannot recommend enough this collection of Rich Mullins songs.  It has blessed me over and over again as I listen to it.I bought this cd not knowing much about Rich's music or his story, and I just fell in love with his rich and beautiful melodies and inspiring lyrics of praise and worship and introspection.  &quot;Songs&quot; is in my top 5 cd's of all time; I have been recommending it to everyone who will listen.  You can't go wrong with this one. I think you will be hardpressed to find a better Christian album than this ""greatest hits"" collection of Rich Mullins.  Mullins died young in life back in 1997, but the profound joy and authentic Christ-honoring faith which he squeezed into those years is present in all these songs.  His tender heart is on display in so many of these songs, such as Let Mercy Lead and On the Verge of a Miracle.  The incredible anthems Awesome God, Sometimes by Step, and Creed are all here, as are the stirring Why do the Nations Rage and the rousing Alrightokuhhuhamen.  I first heard this album back in 1999, and I have not been the same since.  Again, you will be hardpressed to find a more authentic Christian artist or man than Rich Mullins, nor such a combination of a fine musician and a funny and disarming songwriter.  Rich is missed in so many ways.  This is truly a one of a kind album and one of, if not the best, of all time. Rich Mullins continues to be - even years after his death - one of the most transparent and articulate songwriters the world has ever heard. To limit his ability to express the feelings of many others to only the Christian ""genre"" would be understating his God given ability to communicate in a way that touches everyone seeking God's presence as well as asking for explanations for the the things that happen in this life.  I find every song touching and many encourage me to seeks God's will.  Many of his songs effect me so deeply that I find myself crying without even knowing it.  If you are looking for a kindred spirit to encourage you in your path for Christian maturity, you couldn't find a better companion. Still miss him! Still buying his uplifting message filled music. Bet he is in GODs' own choir right about now! Of all the Christian Music CD's that I own, this is the one that everyone, without exception, wants to hear over and over.  Rich Mullins was truly gifted by God and he shares his blessing with us through his music.  If you  have no other Rich Mullins CD's, this is the one to get. This CD embodies eloquence of lyrics whose sole purpose is to praise the  Awesome God who gave us the gift of music in the first place.  Probably,  the most fascinating lyrics to me are in the song &quot;Calling Out Your  Name&quot;:  &quot;I can feel the earth tremble /Beneath the rumbling of  the buffalo hooves / And the fury in the pheasant's wings / And there is  fury in a pheasant's wings / And it tells me the Lord is in His temple /  And there is still a faith that can make the mountains move / And a love  that can make the heavens ring / And I've seen love make heaven ring /  Where the sacred rivers meet beneath / The shadow of the Keeper of the  plains.&quot;  Ya just can't go wrong with this one. This CD collection certainly doesn't need my endorsement, there's 76 reviews already, all of which are a 5, and there will be 100's more if our Lord tarries much longer. It's just that Rich Mullins is my all time favorite and it just seems fitting that I throw my review in the pot.This collection of some of Rich Mullin's best is sure to become one of your favorites if it isn't already. The depth of the lyrics hits everyone at some point in their life, and will minister at a level that is surely God-inspired. The songs will grow on you the more you listen, and the more you listen, the more you will hear the truths of the complexities of simple life. He is the musical Norman Rockwell of the nineties...he captures meaning in what is often passed over as mundane and shows it to us with new eyes. I often wondered why God chose to take him home so soon, but after reading some of the reviews written, I understand how it added even more distinction to what he wrote. And if I really think about all he wrote about, he was really looking forward to meeting his Lord-(so maybe it was God's way of rewarding a job well-done).If a song doesn't 'catch' you at first, try listening (in the car alone seems to work the best) to it several times in a row. You'll be amazed how it will speak to your life. I still hear things in his lyrics, so you can listen to them over and over and never tire of them.If you listen to Christian Music at all, this is a classic that will outlive secular greats like Elvis and the Beatles. (Did I say that?) It's worth it's weight in gold. Rich Mullins wrote one nice little Christian pop song--Awesome God--or so I thought, until I discovered this CD and a broader range of his music.  I find in these songs strong words, compelling music, and the roaring whisper  of the Spirit of God.  This music wears well.  You will return to it time  and again.In &quot;Creed,&quot; speaking of the faith, Rich sings,  &quot;I did not make it, no it is making me./It is the very truth of God  and not the invention of any man.&quot;In &quot;Elijah,&quot; writing  about his own future death, he sings,: &quot;When I leave I want to go out  like Elijah/With a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire.&quot;Rich's  combinatin of words and music, true to the Scriptures, but relevant to  today, can help form Christ in our lives. Rich Mullins surely did sing his praise to the Lord.  In fact, that song is really starting to grow on me.  Other hits like &quot;Awesome God&quot;, &quot;Creed&quot;, &quot;Sometimes By Step&quot;, and &quot;If I Stand&quot; are very uplifting.  (Look for some Bible passages in the liner notes.  They tell you where that particular song's uplifting lyrics came from.)  I haven't heard the whole album yet, but I am very sure it is one masterpiece!  Rich Mullins was one of the best Christian artists of all time.  He will be sorely missed.  But the good thing is that he is in a much better place, where we will be if we put our beliefs in Jesus, our Lord and Saviour.I'm sure you recognize the following:&quot;O God, You are my God And I will ever praise You O God, You are my God And I will ever praise You I will seek You in the morning And I will learn to walk in Your ways And step by step You'll lead me And I will follow You in all of my days&quot;and:&quot;Our God is an awesome God He reigns from Heaven above With wisdom, power and love Our God is an awesome God&quot;.Well, God Bless!And by the way, we are not as strong as we think we are. Rich Mullins was an icon on contemporary Christian music.  This CD is a fine example of his talent. Own a piece of his history and enjoy the free download. The songs on this album are wonderful, uplifting praises!  This was actually my second purchase because I wore the first one out!  Teens enjoy singing several of these songs, too, especially Screen Door! Do you need encouragement, listen to the &quot;Songs&quot; CD by Rich Mullins.  How great is our God?  Listen to 'Awesome God'. This album stands alone in Contemporary Christian music.  Whereas so much of CCM features ""power vocal"" songs with a bible verse or single observation as a hook and run-of-the-mill Nashville production, Rich digs deep.  The lyrics run the gamut from the playful to the poetic to the profound to the deeply personal - this man did not simply parrot Christian platitudes; he REALLY ""got it"" and communicated it.  And how he communicated it  - his vocals have an earnestness and urgency that power vocalists can only wish for.  The songwriting reflects a level of craft that is found almost nowhere else in popular music.  His instrumental versatility (excellent on hammer dulcimer, very good on piano, solid on acoustic guitar and mandolin) give his music a range remiscent of Led Zeppelin and the Beatles.  Although some find the studio versions of his music over-produced, I find them fresh and compelling.  This CD is the best of the best from the very best that Contemporary Christian Music has to offer.  Even when compared to pop musicians in general, these works stand up.  As a pro in the business that knew him once told me, Rich was in a class all by himself. This album has touched my life in such a profound way that I don't know where to begin describing it.  I've been listening to Christian music for quite some time now, and I was already familiar with the songs  &quot;Awesome God&quot; and &quot;Sing Your Praise to the Lord&quot;.  Still, it wasn't until this past Christmas, when my brother gave me the  &quot;Songs&quot; anthology CD, that I became a real fan of Rich Mullins's  music.  When Rich was tragically killed in a car accident in September  1997, the sense of loss among his fans and within the Christian music  community was something I couldn't truly appreciate.  But over the past  month, as I have listened to this CD time and again, that sense of loss has  finally hit home.  I'll probably always regret the fact that I never truly  appreciated Rich Mullins while he was alive, but at least I can enjoy the  work that he has left behind.  And I can take comfort in the fact that his  legacy will continue to touch the lives of many for generations to come.  For those of you who are just now discovering Rich Mullins (like me) and  want to sample his music, this is a great introductory CD.  But I encourage  you to listen to his other albums as well, because he recorded a lot of  other great songs, too many in fact to be able to fit them all into an  anthology.  So listen, enjoy, and then come back for more! I had this CD years ago and loaned it to someone who did not return, thus I ordered it again.  I initially got it for the song ""Creed,"" whose lyrics are essentially the words of the Nicene Creed.  Highlight tracks are ""Creed,"" ""Alrightokayuhuhamen,"" ""Screen Door on a Submarine,"" ""Boy Like Me,"" and ""Hold Me, Jesus."" Many of these songs seem, almost, prophetic of Rich Mullins' death.  &quot;Elijah&quot; is written about a man who is ready to die...are we?  &quot;Let Mercy Lead&quot; tells of a godly parents' desire for their child to be characterized by mercy.  Even in the midst of a broken heart, which is the way of the cross, there is mercy to be found.  The message and the music capture both the young children and their parents.  Many Christian vocalists hailed Rich as the &quot;conscience&quot; of contemporary Christian music.  If you buy 1 Christian CD this year...this is it! This is a great collection of praise music, Rich Mullins was very good at making music. I'm very happy with my purchase. Rich Mullins is probably the greatest contributor to Contemporary Christian Music.  He has composed a variety of beautiful praise music.  His works use a medley of different instruments and song styles so that the listener is never bored.  His lyrics are inspiring because they are real.  Mullins speaks of everyday situations and the way we all want to be (even though we so often fall short).  These songs will lift your spirit, strengthen your faith and inspire you to find that closer relationship with Jesus Christ.Why 5 stars?: Rich Mullins was a beautiful songwriter and artist.  This collection of some of his more popular songs should belong in every Christian's collection.  I kept in my CD player for weeks and it is still one of my favorites.  His style is varied but all are pleasing and meaningful. I USED TO HAVE THIS CD THEN LOST IT. THIS CD WITH GREAT SONGS ON IT HELPED ME THROUGH ALOT OF HARD TIMES SPIRITUALLY AND WHEN A DEATH OF A LOVED ONE OCCURED. SADLY, RICH DIED IN A AUTO ACCIDENT IN 1997 BUT HE'LL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED AS A MAN OF GOD A must have! You will enjoy listening to this cd over and over!  God Bless Rich..... I enjoyed the compositions and especially Rich Mullins use of the hammered dulcimer.  I would recommend this album, musically from it's acoustic value and the messages in the songs will can be valuable to introspection of your own life. Never before in my life has a musician had such an impact on my life.  Rich Mullins is a master of lyrics and the undisputed king of contemporary Christian music.  The CD begins with the timeless favorite &quot;Sing Your Praise To The Lord&quot;, followed by the worship staple &quot;Awesome God&quot;.  My favorites (I love all of them) include &quot;Sometimes by Step&quot;, &quot;Creed&quot;, &quot;If I Stand&quot;, &quot;Screen Door&quot;, &quot;Elijah&quot;, &quot;Calling Out Your Name&quot;, &quot;Alrightokuhuhamen&quot;, and &quot;Hold me Jesus&quot;.  As you can tell, I love his music, and I'm sure you will, too. Rich Mullins was one of those rare birds, the type of Christian who's vision was incorruptible by the makings of man-made religion and the tasty, salted morsels of idealistic micowavable faith. He was resolute, not on the things many pious church mice of our day are, but on the idea that grace has never abandoned us, that it is a very real and passionate force in this world and that God has not quit on humanity or on us as individuals. To the contrary, Mullins' words echo out from the canyons of heaven: that the faith is larger than our modest grasp of it, and that the glory of Christ transcends past the church pews where comfortable ho-hum believers find themselves rationalizing their own bored view of the cross and heaven.Mullins hits us with the weeping testimony of a man in longing for his final home in heaven, of a free-liver who transcendentally  takes in the glory of God through nature in the fields of Kansas, of a wavering Christian on the verge of free-falling from the cliffs of life as he pleads, ""Hold me Jesus, because I'm shaking like a leaf. You have been my King of Glory, now be my Prince of Peace.""Mullins was, in a way, our ""through the looking glass"" tell-it-like-it-is poet who enabled us to think outside the realm of what we've been so boringly taught by a myriad of smug Sunday school teachers and political believers with a self-created agenda to push. Mullins words on this album radiate a calming lesson: life is to live and the faith is more than something to merely talk about. It is something to weep over, test, relish in, and, if it comes to it, bleed yourself dry for.There will likely be others who help us to think more clearly on the reality of the greatness of the One, but there will never be one who was so poignant in the way he made us meditate on the immense, always-abounding beauty of a Creator who adores us more than any lover could hope to dream. Here, you will find a poet who spares us the cheap clich&eacute;s and hits our eardrums with the radiant truth of the Everlasting. The music is not the typical &#34;electric guitars and drum set&#34; band, but each song is enhanced by some other instrument.I enjoy all the songs, and rarely every skip a song.The lyrics relate to your ever day life as well.Very inspiring and powerful songs. I own all of Rich's albums, and I definitely recommend collecting the individual albums if you've just discovered that you love Rich music. That being said, this CD is a WONDERFUL collection of some of Rich's best songs. These songs combine powerful, realistic, encouraging lyrics with amazing dulcimer, piano, and guitar.More than anything, I find that it is the perfect gift for any Christian who isn't familiar with this artist. I give this album time and again, especially to friends or family members who are in some kind of pain. Instead of making them an album of my favorite Rich music, I buy this one to support his legacy and give a timeless gift. Spread the beauty; there is nothing like this music! I love Rich Mullins and his music.  I read where a woman said that Rich Mullins is the best friend she never met.  I feel the same way.  His music is inspiring, comforting, and beautiful.  It touched my heart and my soul.  Rich is in Heaven and yet God still uses him today.  He is truly unique and I look forward to meeting him in Heaven one day. Rich Mullins was the best song writer in popular music.  Not just Christian music.  Yes, that means in my opinion he rates above Lennon/McCartney, Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, Bruce Springsteen, Diane Warren, Page/Plant, Stevie Wonder, etc.  Don't just buy this album - buy them all! First off, I'm not a big fan of modern religious music.  Part of it is because contemporary Christian music is not a type of music I normally listen to.  However, another reason I've never caught the Christian music &quot;bug&quot; is because in my opinion there are a lot of gospel artists out there who don't come right out and say what they mean.  They may mention &quot;Jesus&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot; in their songs, but they don't get right to the point(which to me is, &quot;Jesus saves us from our sins, He died for us, we should follow Him&quot;), as did the early hymn writers I've come to admire.  I'm glad Rich Mullins isn't one of those artists.  After listening to Songs(a Christmas gift from one of my sisters), I found the record to be quite inspiring.  The songs are well-done musically, very positive, and to the point.Highlights are &quot;Sing Your Praise To The Lord&quot;, &quot;Awesome God&quot;, &quot;Hold Me Jesus&quot;, &quot;If I Stand&quot;, &quot;Creed&quot;(Rich's musical reworking of the Apostles' Creed), and &quot;We Are Not As Strong As We Think We Are&quot;.  There's a really upbeat, joyful tone in the songs, a tone that could come only from someone who really believes in what he's saying and wants to spread the word.I recommend that you check out Songs even if you're not a gospel music fan.  You'll come away inspired. I remember hearing a story about Rich Mullins, and how he almost never had any money. I thought how does the guy who wrote ""Awesome God"" never have any money. If you've been a ""praise and worship"" church within the last 15 years, you've heard and probably sung that song. Rich never had any money because he simply gave it all away. As beautiful and thoughtful and interesting as Rich's music is, his lasting influence will be that he walked the walk. That fact makes his music heartfelt and true.If one song epitomizes Rich Mullins, it is the ethereal ""Calling Out Your Name""... unusual instrumentation (hammered dulcimer layered throughout) and beautiful lyrical imagery (""fury in a pheasant's wings""). It's no wonder even 12 years after his death, his music still sounds as fresh as it did when it was released. I bought this CD for the song ""If I Stand"" and was pleasantly surprised at how lovely it was.  Christian music lost a great song writer and singer when he died. Rich Mullins was and still is a tremendously gifted song writer and singer.  I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys music that will bring them closer to Christ. I still miss Rich whom I never met , I still cry when I listen to the prophetic 'Elijah' - if you ever need encouragement in your christian walk, honest down to earth wit and wisdom, uplifting musicianship, a dash of the hammer dulcimer and a heart that cries out to know its Creator (listen to the stunning 'Calling out your Name') or a voice resonant with truth ( while the nations rage, creed), a musician unafraid to confront his fallible self and to find grace in a graceless world (hold me jesus, sometimes by step), this is an excellent introduction to his folky-rocky music - a fine collection of some of his best songs which will send you scarpering after his earlier releases. A fitting legacy to a wonderful ragamuffin Great collection of songs from the late...Great....rich mullins.  He is one of the greats.Ready for more of his albums. Absolutely beautiful.  I had lost another Rich Mullins CD and purchased this as a replacement.  Simply, absolutely beautiful. This is a good cd. The price was good which caused me to buy this particular one. The negative is that the one song I really bought it for has a scratch in it and so it jumps. If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it. If you like christian music and you have not listened to (Wayne)Rich Mullin you must listen to his music.  It truly leaves you feeling like you have experienced something spiritual. When this CD was released, I was a marginal Rich Mullins fan.  I enjoyed what was on the radio, but thought some of his other stuff was a little strange.  But I was thrilled to get this CD because it had all the songs I loved on it.It starts out with a new version of ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord.""  Originally recorded by Amy Grant, it was the first hit for Rich, its songwriter.  I prefer this version because of the wonderful bridge that Rich has put back in the song.And, what collection of Rich's best would be complete without his two signature songs?  Any Christian familiar with Christian music only through church would still be familiar with ""Awesome God"" and the chorus from ""Sometimes by Step.""But there are so many great songs here.  I've always loved the humorous challenge of ""Screen Door.""  ""While the Nations Rage"" is a great reminder of God's power.  And I've been drawn to ""Hold Me Jesus"" since I first heard it.  It's an absolutely wonderful song of surrender to the One who will be there throughout this life.While not every song in this collection is a personal favorite, they are all major songs from Rich's career and deserve to be here.And me?  After Rich's death, I started to appreciate his music much more then I did while he was alive.  I now own all his CD's.  But this remains a favorite.  Any Rich Mullins fan will love having his best in one place.  And any Christian music fan will recognize many of these great songs stuffed full of timeless truth.  This CD belongs in every home. The greatest Christian songwriter of all-time shares timeless classics like ""If I Stand"" and ""Awesome God.""  The man who lived on the median salary of a US worker, taught music his last five years to impoverished elementary students on a Native American reservation, and had less than a closet full of earthly material when he died completely delivers on this greatest hits album.  Rich affected me and my family deeply.  I still miss him a lot even though we're approaching the 15th anniversary of his death. Now he's dancing with Jesus and can finally sing Him the song ""Hold Me Jesus.""  ""If I Stand"" is my favorite song ever.  ""The stuff of earth competes for the allegiance I owe only to the Giver of all good things.""  6 stars in my book.  Like he said, ""Be God's."" It was late 1989 or early 90',pretty near the end of the concert when Rich started playing that familiar little piano intro,I imediatly recognized it and thought ""Why in the world is he playing that song?That's an Amy Grant song!""Then,just as quickly i remembered,""He wrote that song!He has every right to play it as anyone else"".Rich made the keyboard sound like an orchestra that night, even though he was backed by a full band.During ""If i Stand"" he noticed I was singing along to every word and stopped playing and singing and said that it was really humbling  to him to see the crowd know all the words to his songs.I met him after the concert and he was very nice,though his hair looked like it hadn't been combed in days.I still have the album he signed for me and I remember chatting with him on this and another occasion a few years later.This man,like Keith Green was one of a kind.His albums are all brilliant, but this one is a definate must have.His version of ""Sing your Praise to the Lord"" blows Amy Grant's out of the water easily.""Verge of a Miracle"",a song written for one of Rich's friends who tried to commit suicide has a message that is as relevant now as it was back then when it was written.""My one Thing"" is a catchy pop song with a great chorus.I think we can all remember the first time we heard ""Awesome God"",we knew it was different than the other songs on the radio at that time,who knew then that years after his passing ,that it would be sung in churches all over the world in different languages.The music is timeless,the production is superb, the songs and the message are sent from above.I reccomend Rich Mullins music to everyone!Enjoy! This CD literally makes the hair on my arms stand up, I enjoy it so much. If &quot;Awesome God&quot; is not the standard song like &quot;America the beautiful&quot; of the Christian church, it should be. Can't praise it  enough! Songs and Songs 2 has every Rich Mullins song that I ever wanted to own. There is not one disapointing song in the collection. Good Stuff from Rich Mullins. Great selection of songs. Loaded with theology, I highly recommend it. If I stand is one of my favorites. Mullins' cd is an honest reflection of his own personal relationship with Jesus Christ and challenges the listener to realize his/her utter dependence on the Lord.Songs that particularly struck a chord with me include:  My One Thing, Hold Me Jesus, While the Nations Rage, and Awesome God.Indeed, while the songs are my personal favorites in the cd, each song challenges the listener in some way to deepen his/her personal relationship with Jesus Christ and to get past the ""feel good"" religion that many people are content with.Unfortunately, Mullins' untimely death left a void in Christian music.Purchase the cd and be encouraged and challenged in the Lord! I can not say how wonderful I think this album is.  Contains 16 of the best CCM artist of all time. Everything from Creed (Apostle's Creed) to We Are Not As Strong As We Think We Are (An unabashed love song) to If I Stand (the joy of grace (with Michael W. Smith playing the piano)) to Crying Out Your Name (One of Rich's greatest tributes to creation and the Creator) is included in this album.  Anyone who has any interest in Christian music must buy this album. And don't stop there! Buy all of his others too or you will be missing out on some amazing music. Rich Mullins was a true psalmist. His songs are modern in lyric and music, but they lead you in awe and worship of the Lord as well as any classic hymn. This CD captures his very best. I've listened to it numerous times, and every time it lifts me up higher. Rich Mullins' music is often profoundly wise in its lyric content and remarkably uncluttered in its melody...&quot;Songs&quot; is no exception.  This album, (Rich's final album prior to his death) leaves us with an appreciation for his remarkable talent and simple love for God.  The Truth of  the &quot;reckless love and grace of God&quot;  remain a theme throughout.  Our lives, our faith, and our hearts have all been touched by the music of this &quot;ragamuffin&quot; songwriter. This CD is a masterpiece!  I can only imagine how many lives Rich's songs  have touched and will continue to touch!  The songs have such a deep  spiritual meaning!  AWESOME RICH!! This is probably THE album to have if you want to own a Rich Mullins album.Check out the track &#34;allrightokuhhuhamen&#34;. I initially bought this compilation on cassette tape soon after it came out. That cassette got stuck in my player one day and I knew I couldn't go long without replacing it with a CD. Rich Mullins music strikes a chord deep in the heart of the human spirit. He walked the earth with humility, living a no-nonsense, deep, practical faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Last night I listened to it before bed and every song flowed into the next. My favorites are ""If I Stand"" and ""Step by Step."" I love finding videos of him in concert, just him and his piano. His voice was so earthy and alive. He died too young, but I never get tired of listening to the music he left behind. EVERY single song on this cd is great. From sing your praise to the Lord to Hold me Jesus. This is my favorite rich mullins cd. 16 Songs, pure classics that never go away. If you're a rich mullins fan, thisis a must have cd. You just need to have it. I've had it since my freshmen year of college and 5years after, i still listen to this cd frequently.Some of the songs are stuff a  person can relate to. Some will make streams of tears flow down your cheek. I think Rich Mullins is someone who didn't just make music. His heart was in it and he shared his belief and faith through his music. Too bad i was too young in the 90's. Nevertheless, i'm glad i have this cd - it's something i'll use to remember this great legend. May his soul RIP and Rich, I hope you went out like Elijah. I have purchased this CD many times over, as it is something I like to share with family & friends ~ A very nice mix of Christianity & the Native American culture. My only regret is that Mr. Mullins died before I got to attend one of his praising concerts!! Rest in Peace, Rick &#60;3 One of the best CD I own. It draws me closer to GOD. No matter what mood your in. Awesome. Seven years after his death, Rich Mullins is still sorely missed by those who knew & loved him, and by those who loved his music.  I never actually knew or met Rich, but I do remember seeing him perform live at the Ichthus festival in Wilmore, Kentucky (Spring 1990).  I'll also never forget attending a chapel service one morning as a student at Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois (Fall 1987, I think).  Instead of a regular speaker, Rich was invited as a special guest (I believe he was doing a regular concert on campus that night).  He spoke briefly and performed a few songs--I especially remember him doing ""Screen Door"" using the styrofoam cups as he sang.  We all really got into it--it was great!  I am more than pleased to have ""Songs"" & ""Songs 2"" in my CD collection.  Many of Rich's greatest and most inspiring songs are on these discs--especially ""Songs.""  Some of my favorite tracks here include ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord,""  ""Awesome God,"" ""Creed,"" ""If I Stand,"" ""Screen Door,"" ""Elijah,"" ""Alrightokuhhuhamen,"" ""Verge of a Miracle"" and (my overall favorite Rich Mullins song) ""Hold Me Jesus.""  ""Songs"" is a great selection of songs from a man who inspired & challenged many believers to grow closer to Christ in their walk with Him rather than just opting for the sugar-coated ""comfort zone"" Christianity that too many people in our society have settled for.  God bless you, Rich! This is the one to start with if you love great deep spiritual songwriting! Rich Mullins was the best song writer to come along in a long time.  His lyrics were tremendous and speak to the heart.  &quot;Elijah&quot; seems to be prophetic of his own death.  This album represents all of his various styles with several wonderful, and challenging songs.  If you are new to CCM, then let this album be the first one on your list! Classics from a Legendary Christian Composer. Really Captures the romance of our faith and awe of the awesome God we serve in music. Rich Mullins will probably be best remembered as &quot;the guy who wrote 'Awesome God', and that's probably a good way to be remembered.  But anyone unfamiliar with the incredible music that Rich put out during his too-short life would do well to start their education with this CD.  Many of his best songs are here: Awesome God, Sing Your Praise To The Lord, Sometimes By Step, Hold Me Jesus, Creed.  When this set was compiled, however, it included some of Rich's best early work, too, like Verge Of A Miracle, alrightokuhhuhamen, and Elijah.  I didn't give the collection five stars simply because there's no way one CD could have encompassed the essence of Rich's music.  This is an excellent album, and a good one with which to start a collection, but I hope that listeners won't limit themselves to the music here.  There's a lot more to discover! I went to Christ in Youth in the 80's and had Rich once as my teacher.  He was singing ""Elijah"" back then.  I come to find he also sang ""Awesome God"" which I love.  The whole CD is good to listen to and while I was in the Hospital I listened to it alot.  Rich Mullins I will see you in Heaven.  I hope you and Jesus are singing together up there for our Father in Heaven. Love, Scott Great songs and song writer and not all in your face.. The insert even has verses that coincide with the songs. Good buy! This Greatest Hits collection by the late great Rich Mullins,is amazing.Whenever life gets you down,just pop in this CD,raise your hands to The Lord,and you WILL be blessed by this.God gave Rich Mullins so many great songs,and a great talent.Sadly,Rich left this world way too soon.But as fans,we have the assurance that he is in Heaven,and singing his praise to The Lord.Fans of Christian music will love this collection.I highly recommend it. ....Top Favorite Picks:""Sing Your Praise To The Lord"",""Awesome God"",""Creed"",""If I Stand"",""While The Nations Rage"" and ""Hold Me Jesus"". Although I enjoyed Rich Mullins' music for several years before he died, I regret that I never did see him in concert.This album was released about a year before his death.  I always loved Amy Grant's rendition of &quot;Sing Your Praises to the Lord&quot;, and until the release of &quot;Songs&quot;, I wasn't aware that Rich Mullins had written this song!I love what he did with the song - it is one of my all-time favorite songs and this is one of my all-time favorite albums.  I was unaware that Amy had left out a part of this song and Rich's version is just so wonderful - it's hard to describe!Rich died Friday night, September 19, 1997.  I didn't find out about his death until someone told me at church (before the service) that next Sunday.  While sitting in church, I pulled out a piece of paper and copied these words from memory - they are the chorus to &quot;If I Stand&quot;, one of the songs on this album:So if I stand let me stand on the promise  That you will pull me throughAnd if I can't, let me fall on the grace  That first brought me to You  And if I sing let me sing for the joy  That has born in me these songs  And if I weep let it be as a man  Who is longing for his homeRich Mullins was never really part of this world.  It was obvious from his recorded music (and from his concerts, according to those who did get to see him in concert) that his home was truly elsewhere.  Another song on this album, &quot;Elijah&quot; came to my mind after finding out about his death:But when I leave I want to go out like Elijah  With a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire  And when I look back on the stars  Well, It'll be like a candlelight in Central Park  And it won't break my heart to say goodbyeSo did Rich know that his time on earth would be cut short?  I don't know, but I'm really thankful to the Lord for giving Rich the songs that he in turn gave to us.Another favorite song on this album is &quot;Sometimes by Step&quot; and &quot;Screen Door Song&quot; is just a fun and lively ditty that will have you snapping your fingers right along with them.  Anyone know how to do the cup game?This CD gives you an hour of Rich's music.  The last song, &quot;Hold Me Jesus&quot;, is a perfect ending.  There is another album, Songs 2, which is also good, but not as good as this one.If you like Rich's music, you can't miss The Jesus Record!  See my other reviews to read about this CD and many other Christian albums.God bless you! Excellent music all of his best songs. This CD contains some of the best praise and worchip music you will ever hear. This has to be the best CD of all time. I listen to many different types of music, but this is the best CD I own. Rich really had a special gift with words and music. After completely using up two tapes, I finally bought a CD and keep it in my CD changer all the time. I have given this CD to several people as a gift and everyone loves it. Thanks Rich for a great collection of ""Songs"". Unbelievable. No matter where you are in your walk with Christ, this is the album to own. The lyrics in each song are simple enough to minister to the newest Believer, yet powerful enough to touch the life long Christian.  This is the legacy of this great Psalmist, you will never get tired of  listening to this CD. A friend recommended this cd to me. It contains his signature &#34;Awesome God&#34; and &#34;Sometimes By Step&#34; as well as other great songs. I play it over and over:) Seeing that there are already over a hundred reviews for this album, probably no one will ever read mine, so I'll just be brief.Quite simply, I LOVE this album for the thrilling guitar melodies, Mullins' clear and dulcet voice, and the excellently poetic and Christian lyrics.  It's a wonderfully light album with uplifting worship, gentle joy, and soft hope.  Mind you, it's more of an acoustic, folksy feel, so don't expect any heavy electric guitar, intense drumming, or the like.  Also, ""Screen Door"" is the one odd song in the list that to me doesn't fit with the rest -- too experimental, maybe?  I don't particularly like it, but that might just be my own oddness.  I love all the other songs on the album and think it's just a wonderful musical compilation. It has been written that prior to Mullins' death he was considering converting to Catholicism.  One only has to listen to the songs on this album and take a look at the CD artwork to see that this was most likely  true.This collection features some of Mullins' best known work.  Ever-present in so many of the songs is the hammer dulcimer.In addition  to the very well recognized &quot;Sing Your Praise to the Lord,&quot;  &quot;Awesome God,&quot; &quot;If I Stand&quot;, the album also  features:&quot;Creed&quot; - moving musical version of the Apostle's  Creed&quot;Calling Out Your Name&quot; - a beautiful song based on Psalm  19.And the delightful &quot;Boy Like Me/Man Like You&quot;.Do  yourself a favor. Get this album.  You won't regret it! Rich Mullins was one of the best songwriters to bless Christian Music, and this represents some of his best work. If you are unfamiliar with the depth of his writing, you will be amazed at the honest appraisal of the human heart that he reveals.""If I stand, let me stand on the promise that You will pull me through; and if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You."" Rich Mullins was and is a prophet of the ages. His divinely inspired lyrics are guaranteed to draw you into a closeness with God as never felt before. Rich was a real person who desired no more than to have the Mind of  Christ. Though Rich may be gone to Heaven, his presence is still felt on  earth as in his somewhat short earthly life He left a witness and message  that will stand throughout all future generations in song. I first started listening to Rich Mullins in the early 90's when a lot of his greatest hits were coming out.  He, in my opinion, is one of the greatest Christian music songwriters of all time.  I remember being in shock when I heard of his passing.  I had just moved to NC and heard about it over my local Christian radio station.  As a songwriter myself, I not only enjoyed listening to his incrediable music but I loved his lyrics, and that's where I think Rich really shined the most.  Rich's heart and soul were in his lyrics.  Rich lifted up the Lord and His people through music.  Rich also practiced what he preached.

182,386,B0000004TZ,"Now before judging me about giving Samantha Fox a 4 star review, you have to know I didn't like this album because I wanted to stick my face in between those enormous Fox knitters - all my friends did but they were, oh what's that word, freaky people - oh yeah heterosexual; anyhoos, what I found then and what I still find is this is a really fun pop album. It's not quite as 80s dated sounding as her later albums or as dancy, (I Wanna Have Some Fun) this is more 80s pop rock but still has enough of that late 80s schtick to be sweet and a lot of fun. The songs are all enormously catchy and as I used to do with the tape I skip right over the hit song and go to the bones of those boobs - there are some damn fine ditties on here ""Do Ya Do Ya (Wanna Please Me)"" with it's little break down in the middle, metal guitars and bouncy sex is fun to sing along with and my ultimate favorite ""I Want You To Want Me"", the sexy and fun ""Suzie Don't Leave Me With Your Boyfriend"" where Miss Fox begs her pal Susie not to leave her alone with Susie's boyfriend since he was last seen hitting on Samantha, well by the end of the song Suzie's pissed, Samantha's shagging the boyfriend and we're all left with a dance ditty. Personally I never felt sorry for Susie, I mean in Samantha's defense she did warn her pal; on top of pop/rock, there's also a little rockabilly number called ""Hold On Tight"" which I find myself turning up every time it comes on. I love this album and so will you if you find it cause like a tramp in the night I'm begging you to buy a copy (and I've seen it for a mere $3) It will take you back and realize not all porn sluts (Paris Hilton) are only talented on their knees.... and as a side note if you think Samantha didn't have an influence on the current pop scene all you have to do is listen to Avril Lavigne's ""Girlfriend"" which sounds like Samantha singing and could easily pass as a lost track from the Touch Me album. When I was watching the MTV Top 20, I saw that the #1 single on the UK charts was held by a hot blonde named Samantha Fox, with a real naughty title.  After seeing the video, I thought, yup, gotta get this and mail Tipper Gore the lyrics, including the hungry moans midsong.  The album wasn't out yet Stateside and after learning that she used to be a topless model, a Page 3 girl in the Sun, I felt like a reader peering at page 3 through a peephole in page 1.  Touch Me sports a mix of rock guitar and synth pop, with Foxy displaying the nicer side&quot;I'm All You Need&quot; is more keyboard pop than the hard-driving soft-X rocker before, and shows her nice girl side.The imagination requires little to find out why Sam sings &quot;Suzie, Don't Leave Me With Your Boyfriend&quot;.  It's a confessional to the title girl of what happened between Sam and him last night, and they weren't going over his stamp collection.  This features a nice punchy brass section and catchy rhythm throughout.  However, in spilling things out and still wanting to maintain her friendship with Suze, I kind of wonder if there's a subtle hint that she wants to take the guy for herself.&quot;Wild Kinda Love&quot; is another synthesizer and hard guitar dance track, and the kind of love and life she wants of living fast and feeling good like the boys.  No Jane Austen books on this chick's library, for sure.  She's quite the tomboy here, &quot;I'm gonna break the rules the boys won't play by.&quot;Then comes another standout track, the early Elvis-style rocker of &quot;Hold On Tight&quot;, down to the guitar.  There's a nod to the Stray Cats and Big Joe Turner:  &quot;We're going to rock this town, we;re going to watch it rattle and roll.&quot;  Given the studded leather jacket on her album cover, she had to be a rocker, didn't she?Call The second single, &quot;Do Ya Do Ya (Wanna Please Me)&quot; Billy Idol meets Falco's &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot;, it's another tough girl singing about whether a guy can give her what she needs.  Things go in intensity when the male backing singers sing &quot;give me what I want, give me what I need&quot;The next two songs seem to flow into each other, as they display equal tempo and sound.  &quot;Want You To Want Me&quot; features a steady bass and 80's keyboard synths that evoke Sheena Easton or Kim Wilde, and a nice guitar solo.  The verses to &quot;Baby I'm Lost For Words&quot; sports early 80's new wave synths like Altered Image or The Vapours, but the guitars and mid-80's synths come roaring in on the chorus.&quot;Rockin' The City&quot; is heavily pronounced punkish riffs muted with some synths, and is the last barnburner of this album.  Another standout track with is at home on a party tape with Joan Jett and Led Zep should one want to jam just as hard but to a different sound.Apart from &quot;Suzie&quot; or the last song, all the songs could've been singles.  debut was an early taste at imported contemporary pop, which set a trend of me hearing about a group or song on MTV, then waiting a year for it come out here, realizing that the Brits sure did better music than us Yanks.  Yeah, yeah, she wouldn't get an invite to play at an opera house, but this girl with street-cred image is able to inject some good-natured if not a bit of naughty in her voice.  It's been awhile since I last listened to it, and I still enjoy it as much as I did back then.  However, the reason I'm giving this 4 stars is due to the better production and superlative songs on her next album. I've waited a long time for a remaster like this. Sure it has several 12"" mixes and all the b-sides, but WHY did they give us the useless Fox Hunt Mix instead of the original 12"" mix of Touch Me, which has never been on CD before. Every various artist compilation and even a couple of Samantha Fox 12"" compilations have always included the ""blue mix"", which is the b-side to the original 12"" mix. The Blue mix is HORRIBLE, removing all the agression and rockin' feel of the original track. What a missed opportunity. Track list and times:1. Touch Me (I Want Your Body) 3:462. I'm All You Need 4:283. Suzie, Don't Leave Me With Your Boyfriend 3:554. Wild Kinda Love 3:345. Hold On Tight 3:386. Do Ya Do Ya (Wanna Please Me) 3:507. Want You To Want Me 3:308.

Fox Hunt Mix: I Surrender/Touch Me Medley 5:56 touch me by samantha fox is a very good first album. some of my favorite songs are touch me i want your body,wild kind of love, do ya do ya wanna please me,i'm all you need,and he's got sex. i really like this album. I just picked up a copy of the 2 disc. I also own theoriginal USA cd(which also has a different track listing for the 10 songs on it).For some reason I had a suspicion that this might be a LOUD remaster (LOL). On the ""remaster"" the original tracks had a Foobar Dynamic Range of 8 (AWFUL). The original had a ""13"" score, which is THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN FROM A ROCK CD. The only better 44/16 score I've ever seen was an acoustic jazz cd.Of course, despite primitive 80's a/d convertors (which produce lots of grain & lack of detail), the original sounded tons better due to the lack of shrill compression. Amazing how much things have changed for the worst. And sad, because a combo of today's electronics with no-minimal compression can produce stunning results; including at 44/16 especially with HDCD.I have not heard theWounded Bird 1 disc.I'm assuming that anyone looking at this set is familiar with the original album. I consider it a fun (though somewhat mindless) 80's ""guilty pleasure"" & probably her best. Not a lot to be said about this album besides it's good memories it will bring me each time I'll think of 80's icons! (not a word about Sam's advantages...) Le me explain why the 3 in rating it: First, it is not a top record from the 80's if we compare it to such records from Whitney Houston, Celine Dion or Debbie Gibson and specially because Samantha Fox did not commit to music since the very beginning. This is a enjoyable rock and roll based record, with catchy and memorable melodies and a good voice by Fox. I enjoy it a lot since I am very attached to 80's music. For what is worth, Samantha's best releases are the first two. So if you like 80's pop with good melodies and a full charge of hits go and get this one! You will enjoy it! So starts the song of 'Hold on Tight'. No matter how many times I've heard this song, I just can't help but to laugh out loud. Perhaps it's because she's actually trying to sing rock, maybe it's because she's singing with guitars and not crappy drum machines, or maybe, just maybe this is the song that shows Samantha for what she really is, a big breasted, blond, British, bimbo (that's a lot of B's) that sizzled her way from Page 3 to the airwaves.Hey I like Sammy, I really do. She's sexy and beautiful, all of her albums had at least two or three songs that I liked, and who didn't make out with their girlfriends in the back seat of their dad's car with Ms. Fox on the radio? Sam is what she is and we love her for it. I'd put her up against flat chested Britany any day. ""Touch Me"" was Samantha Fox's first album and was released in 1986. The album produced 4 hit singles, ""Touch Me"", ""Do Ya Do Ya"", ""Hold on Tight"" and ""I'm All You Need"".The original vinyl LP contained 10 songs but not long after its release, the record company felt it needed a couple of stronger album tracks. So ""Want You To Want Me"" and ""Rockin' In The City"" were recorded and relegated ""It's Only Love"" and ""Drop Me A Line"" to join the non-album tracks, ""Tonight's The Night"" and ""Never Gonna Fall in Love Again"", for use as b-sides for the singles mentioned above in different countries.""I'm All You Need"" and the great album track ""Baby I'm Lost For Words"" are 2 songs that show Samantha tackling some more serious material and vocally extending her, hinting at the better and stronger sound that was to come on her next album.This re-release of ""Touch Me"" contains all 14 songs that were recorded by Samantha Fox in 1985 and 1986, as well as several extended and remixed versions of the first 3 singles. I believe the Fox Hunt Mix should have been omitted though from this release and its place taken by both the single mix and 12"" version of ""I'm All You Need"".""Touch Me"" is a must have for both fans of Samantha Fox and those who have a love of great 80s music. No Bad Songs,Went Gold. This Is One Of My Favorite Cds Of Samantha Fox.And One Of Her Best For someone who comes from bare-modelling to singing, this album is surprisingly good. Samantha doesn't have the strongest voice, but she works it well and it is enough for her kind of music. Catchy tracks like ""Rockin in the city"", ""I'm all u need "" and ""Suzie"" show that the album has more than just the hits ""Touch me"" and ""Hold on tight"". Steady debut Easily the best Sam Fox album - if you like the rocky side of sam. Great Fusion of Rock and Dance. Not too sophisticated, just pure fun stuff.

185,389,B0000004UI,"The garbage doesn't stop. Kool Moe Dee releases more garbage.Don't buy this album you will be disapointed. When God speaks, the wise will listen!!  If you like/love Kool Mo Dee's music, then you'll absolutely love his book, &quot;There's a God on the Mic - The True 50 Greatest MC's&quot;!  This is not just another list of MC's - this is the definitive Hip-Hop bible.  Previous attempts to rank MC's have been compiled by people who don't possess the knowledge, expertise and wisdom that Mo has - who better to write this book than a veteran practitioner of the craft??  This book is also a historical look at hip-hop/rap music and he provides the reader with thoughtful and thought provoking analysis of each rapper included on the list.  It's written from a personal perspective and he includes an explanation of the categories used for ranking purposes.  And for you sports fans, Mo uses a lot of sports analogies in this book, which makes it even more enjoyable to read.  If you're a serious student of musicology, hip-hop-ology or rapology, this book is required reading!  Peace Usually don't listen to RAP but KOOL MO is  definitely rated up there with the likes of TUPAC and others.  LOVE YA MO!!! This was one of Kool Moe Dee's better CD's. It took me back to the days when Rap was actually good and it wasn't about talking about and downing woman and talking about all the drugs out there. Kool Moe Dee is the bomb.  I remember listening to this album so many  times my cassette wore out.  Wild Wild West with the Kool ricocheting  bullet sound is the standout. this is a classic.back when you had your own Idenity&amp;battled on the  Mic.Kool Moe Dee came out to battle.this was when Rap was about that all  the Numbers Non-Sense it has become.Kool&amp;LL battling each other on  Record is what's missing now.you knew the Lyric's were gonna be tight.Kool  did this Album With New Jack Swing Genius Teddy Riley&amp;it has stood the  test of time.this is very essential. After reading the other reviews, I realized a something, when rating albums like this, you have to take a few things into consideration like cultural impact, overall value, what the trend at the time was, how well it stands the test of time, etc...  As far as impact goes, I can't think of a single club that didn't have classics like &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; and &quot;How Ya Like Me Now&quot; in heavy rotation and the overall value of the CD is still high.  If you're into old school hip hop, this should be considered essential listening.  I know that his rhyme style is somewhat elementary, but you have to remember that just about everyone had a simplistic rhyme style back then (Kurtis Blow or Run DMC, anyone?) because that was the trend at the time and rap music has always been about trends.  Back then you had to have your own style or image.  Everyone wanted to do something different instead of everything sounding the same like todays rap music.  I saw in another review where someone said that Teddy Riley did some production on this album, but that's not the case.  Teddy Riley helped produce Kool Moe Dee's self titled 1986 debut, but he's absent on this album.  In his place was Pete Q. Harris.  Though this album came out in '87, it still has an '85 feel to it.  Tracks like &quot;Way Way Back&quot;, &quot;Stupid&quot;, and &quot;No Respect&quot; seem to bring the albums overall value down, but tracks like &quot;Don't Dance&quot; and &quot;Suckers&quot; instantly make you want to get up and start doing the wop like it was '87 all over again.  Tracks like &quot;I'm A Player&quot; sound like a B Side to his 1st album, but they were still funky while tracks like &quot;Get Paid&quot; are classic Moe Dee at his best.  Overall, this album was off the hook when it first came out, but it doesn't have a lot of replay value now.  But if you're throwing an 80's party or you just want to stroll down memory lane every now and then, you should dust this one off and give it a spin with the rest of the classics you play.Standout Tracks: Wild Wild West (My Favorite), How Ya Like Me Now, Rock You, &amp; Don't Dance This is classic hip-hop at it's finest. Kool Moe Dee was a great lyricist and helped with the transition from the simple rhyme schemes to more complicated one's. This album had the classic hits &#34;Wild, Wild West&#34; and &#34;How You Like Me Know&#34; which gave everyone the insight on his and LL Cool J's rivalry. Good album for hip-hop enthusiasts!  I had a great time reminiscing with this album. ""I'm not your average rapper, so I can't half step. i gotta come off right, I got a MOE DEE rep. And imma live up to, cause ya'll can't do it. Alot rappers tried...but they blew it. There's a heavy demand for me, Cause I am the Man they see, on stage, front page of newspapers and TV. Radio stations don't play me enough. It's doesn't make no difference, cuz Im so rough. I'm tough, either way you look at it, Rappers wish that they had it...As good as MOE DEE, that's why they try to be me. And, what they've become is a facsmilie. Rappers wanna beat me. Ladies wanna see me. There ain't no comparisons, so why don't yall just leave me..alone, cuz I own the microphone.

Love House (Cool Mix)14. I Only Wanna Be With You (Instrumental) The album &quot;I wanna have some fun&quot; by Samantha Fox is seriously a masterpiece. It combines fun club RnB like &quot;I wanna have some  fun&quot; and &quot;Next to me&quot; which is soft RnB and very sexy. And  goes over Dance pop like &quot; i only wanna be with u&quot; and &quot;U  started sth&quot; and &quot;Walking on air&quot;. &quot;Your house or my  house&quot; is a pop song that will make your party goin! &quot;Ready for  this love&quot; is a sweet love story with honest lyrics. &quot;Hot for  u&quot; is the rocky Sam and has a lot of guitars and drums involved.  &quot;Love house&quot; is a acid house song which represents the club life  and is one of the most sexiest tunes ever. &quot;Confession&quot; is a five  star ballad about a strong fault, it goes very deep, this song is  co-written by Sam Fox. &quot;Out of hands&quot; is the most impressive song  out of these impressive songs, it is a story about a lost relationship. In  this song u'll hear Sam's voice really clear and it's amazing how wonderful  it sounds.  So go for this masterpiece, I recommend it strongly. I first bought this album on cassette in 1989 and when I switched to CD's, I got this one as one of the first. The album is pure pop, and suggestive without being raunchy. The best songs on this set are the title track (edited on every other album it's on--that's why a fan of Fox's HAS TO HAVE this album), &quot;Your House or My House&quot;, I Only Wanna Be With You&quot;, and &quot;One In A Million&quot;. There are only 2 songs I did not enjoy: &quot;Confession&quot; and &quot;Out Of Our Hands&quot;. Other than those, the tracks are very upbeat,dancable, and singable. Need some &quot;Fun&quot;?? Check out Samantha (the) Fox!! With a successful formula on her second album, I wonder if Samantha Fox theorized that the more producers the better, a strategy that works to some extent for Jennifer Rush.  In addition to the Steve Power/Steve Lovell team and that of Stock-Aitken-Waterman, I Wanna Have Some Fun boasts two songs each done by Rob and Ferdi Bolland and Fred Zarr, with others doing one song only, and yes, their distinctive styles emerge.  80's dance pop definitely predominates here, but there are a few surprises here as well.The title track might as well be called ""Naughty Girls Still Need Love.""  ""Hello it's me again/don't you know it's hard to keep a good woman down/but then again, maybe that could be fun.""  After a giggle, the song begins in earnest with a funky bass backbeat and harmonies by the Full Force boys and some monologue rap in the middle.""Are you ready to do things tonight that you never dreamed were possible?  Follow me.""  With that spoken intro, we get ""Love House"", a more danceable single, which has harmony vocals, a cacophony of rap-scratched words, strange voices, special effects, and ominous vocals of the guide of the house.  I initially thought this was produced by Full Force, because of the heavy bass beat but it's a Bollands production.  I really enjoyed my visit to this house, all right.Samantha must have really fallen in love with drum machines and bass beats, as ""Your House Or My House"" mixes those and sundry keyboards, computerized voices, and a strong backing chorus and monologue by Sam.  Pure dance pop, call it Stock-Aitken-Waterman vanilla with some chocolate mousse and sprinkles.The Full Force-produced ""Next To Me"" is similar to but injects a trice more fizzy pop to Full Force's 80's R&amp;B formula.Fred Zarr produced ""Ready For This Love,"" a spright thumping drum machines and funky synths that resembles something Kim Wilde might have done on her Close album, also released in 1988.Power and Lovell were responsible for the haunting ""True Devotion"" on her eponymous album.  They do another one, ""Confession"", which explores sin in a religious aspect, only this time, a heavy bass synth beat,  drum track, quick bursts of string synths, and satanically deep voice saying things like ""Je t'accuse.""  The rhythm reminds me somewhat of Mick Jagger's ""Just Another Night.""Then comes the two typical S-A-W bubblegum songs, the first one, a single, being a cover of Dusty Springfield's ""I Only Wanna Be With You.""  It's only fair to give Foxy a 60's song after Kylie did ""The Locomotion,"" right?  ""You Started Something"" is of a slightly slower tempo, though the sound is unmistakable.  On both these songs, Foxy blows the S-A-W bubblegum without it messily sticking on her face like those who don't chew Hubba Bubba gum-remember those commercials?If S-A-W was upbeat, then what does one call ""One In A Million""?  S-A-W songs on steroids?  The Bollands produced this song, with a rapid fire chorus and a sound Bananarama would've peeled their skins for, there's even a fierce guitar solo midsong.  A must have on any disco mix tape.""Walking On Air"", produced by Fred Zarr, is more Kim Wilde, Close-era pop and reduced the BPM compared to the previous barnburner.The next song, ""Hot For You"" boasts synths but also a guitar that's alternatively wails and grinds like light metal.  Is she trying to do Pat Benatar or Vixen, I ask, complimenting the laudable guitar solo that could fit in 80's pop-metal?  Nothing wrong with the song.""Out Of Our Hands"" is another atmospheric Power and Lovell ballad, sporting piano, bombastic power synths, and haunting vocals by Sam.The variety of sounds, be it Full Force-style R&amp;B/pop, bubblegum synth pop, or the attempt at pop-metal, makes I Wanna Have Some Fun a masterpiece for Foxy.  And just think, when I first got this, I was thrown by what I perceived to be an incoherent mess. I am being block from writing separate reviews for these CDs, so I've joined them into one.WOUNDED BIRD RELEASEThis truly is a fantastic package from Wounded Bird, and doesn't suffer from the sound quality problems some of their releases do. Samantha's music is as bass heavy and thumping as always. You pretty much get the entire album plus full length 12"" mixes and b-sides. There's only ONE issue with this disc, and it's really a necessary evil. In order to fit all the songs on this reissue, they had to EDIT the album version of the hugely popular ""I Wanna Have Some Fun."" Originally 5 minutes on the first release of this album, this edition fades the song very abruptly at 3:55. Naturally, that really bites, but the only other option would have been to make this a two disc set for about another minute of music... HOWEVER, the bright side to this travesty is that the included EXTENDED version of I Wanna Have Some Fun is essentially the album version with about a 10 second spoken intro by Samantha tacked onto the beginning. That's right. I never understood from the days when I bought the original 12"" how they could consider 10 seconds extra of spoken intro an EXTENDED version, but that's what the 12"" version is. So in other words, the album version IS on here, it just has a spoken intro attached to it (which I actually think may have been on the original 7"" version. not sure). So, if you don't mind having a little extra something before you get to the opening beats of the LP version, the extended version should suffice. The only other real gripe is the lack of liner notes. It's pretty minimal. Would have been nice to have some background information as to what bonus tracks were on what single releases. Track list:1. I Wanna Have Some Fun (edit)2. Love House3.

But fear not, it's on the double disc reissue of ""Just One Night.""The BIGGEST thrill for me is to learn that there's actually an 'extended version' of the Stock Aitken Waterman produced album mix of I Only Wanna Be With You. The mix I original had on vinyl is a house mix of the song (included here as well), but I always longs for an extended hi-nrg mix and never knew it existed until now. Also, with all the mixes included, I'm surprised the left off the have some fun dub mix of I Wanna Have Some Fun, which has some very unique parts (including male ad libs) that aren't on any other mix of the song included here.CHERRY RED TRACK LIST:CD1I Wanna Have Some Fun  5:01Love House  4:35Your House Or My House  3:55Next To Me  5:32Ready For This Love  4:20Confession  4:38I Only Wanna Be With You  2:44You Started Something  3:23One In A Million  4:38Walking On Air  4:10Hot For You  4:11Out Of Our Hands  4:13Don't Cheat On Me  3:05Lovin' Don't Grow On Trees  4:09All I Wanna Do...

Yes, the sound is very dated, but the tunes are still danceable and singable twenty years later.While some tunes are obvious fillers, the album/tape/cd is majority loaded with pretty good songs such as ""Love House,"" ""Your House Or My House,"" the dance-pop ""I Only Wanna Be With You,"" and the standard slow song (that is, seemingly, a must on every dance album), ""Out of Our Hands.""Granted, it's not deep stuff when it comes to house or dance, but it's a pretty decent start.  - Donna Di Giacomo This is a good album by Samantha Fox.  It features the hits &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; and &quot;I Only want To Be With You&quot;.  Unfortunatley after this album her career faded into oblivion and I have no idea where she went.  I don't think people gave her a fair chance and once the nineties came she disappeared.  I hope she returns to the pop scene soon. The 3rd album by the super-sexy but not overly suggestive Samantha Fox (born 4-15-66) has many fine moments as well as her most commercially successful song ""I Wanna Have Some Fun"" (the only one to hit the Top 40 in R&B as well as pop). Other highlights include the non-hit ""Next To Me"" and the Dusty Springfield cover ""I Only Wanna Be With You."" Not as strong as her self-titled 1987 album, mainly due to the lack of anything as hauntingly mesmerizing as ""True Devotion,"" but still several steps above her stale efforts of the 90s. ...that not even the S-A-W or the Bolland's songs save it. It is very rare to find a pop-dance-mass marketed album to be of high quality but it is not that hard to find at least a album you can hear completely and find one or two good moments. This album is an absolute waste if not for the two singles I find no explanation to own this album and you can get those singles in any greatest hits compilation. The rest of the songs sound very generic, repetitive like half-finished songs. Absolute FILLERS. When you start playing this album, and you DON'T hear ""Hello, it's me again"", you know something is wrong. As the other two reviewers noted, you don't get the original album version of the title track on this CD. Why? If the so-called bonus track of the song is so similar to the original album cut, why not re-release the album as it was made, and then put the shorter single version as a bonus track?I have yet to find any Wounded Bird release that doesn't have some serious problems when compared to the original album. When Samantha Fox released this album in the late 80's, she reached the peak of her popularity. It spawned three succesful singles (the title track, &quot;I Only Wanna Be With You&quot; and &quot;Love House&quot;), and heralded her first-ever world tour.What surprises the most with this album is how good it still sounds today. The big variety of producers makes it for quality listening, and it's an album that doesn't stall on the same sound twice. Most people were turned off by the fact that Samantha was a former porn star, and that she didn't have the most powerful voice in the world, but hey, she could still carry a pop tune and make you feel what it's about.There were many, many great moments on this album. Of course, the three singles were fantastic (&quot;Love House&quot; was even totally ripped by Madonna on her classic &quot;Vogue&quot; single - same beat, same funky piano solo near the end), but I always wondered why there weren't more singles from the album. &quot;Ready For This Love&quot; in particular is a magnificent pop song, highly danceable and almost euphorical; if this one doesn't put you in a good mood, then chances are you're already dead. &quot;One In A Million&quot; was also a very catchy dance song, very energetic; and &quot;Hot For You&quot; was arguably one of the album's best songs, adding a surprising rock and roll touch to an album that was mostly dance and pop. It was a nice reminder that Samantha had initially opted for a rock and roll orientation for her career. &quot;Confession&quot; is also a standout, with its ambiant mood and dark edge. And the closer, the beautiful rock ballad &quot;Out Of Our Hands&quot;, proved that she had the versatility to do a great job on ballads.There are only a couple of duds on this album : the boring &quot;Next To Me&quot;, which proved that Full Force had little creativity as producers and could only rely on two hooks; and &quot;Walking On Air&quot;, too generic and repetitive for its own good.After this album, Samantha said in interviews that she would go in the direction set by songs like &quot;Hot For You&quot; and &quot;Out Of Our Hands&quot;, meaning more rock records. Unfortunately, her record company wanted to milk the dance formula to death and they hired Full Force once again to work on Sam's follow-up, the boring and half-baked &quot;Just One Night&quot;. Thus ended the career of Samantha, proving that an artist should be the one to have creative control, and not the record company. Still, &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; lived up to its title - and still does 15 years after its release. ""I Wanna Have Some Fun"" was originally released in 1988 and was Samantha Fox's last successful album. It produced 3 hit singles, ""Love House"", ""I Wanna Have Some Fun"" and ""I Only Wanna Be With You"".The original vinyl LP contained 12 songs kicking off with a 5 minute version of ""I Wanna Have Some Fun"". The version that appears on this CD is one of the single versions of the song that was released at the time. The extended version that is a bonus on this re-release is identical to the original album version, after the first 10 seconds!""Don't Cheat On Me"" was the b-side to ""Love House"" and it does not date back to 1986 (as the sleeve notes has it)! Nor was it produced by Phil Nicholas. Chris Tsangarides produced the track. This song and ""Confession"" were the first tracks that Samantha herself had a hand in writing.Another bonus on this re-release is ""Now I Lay Me Down"". This version sounds much rougher, especially Samantha's vocals, and unpolished than the song that appeared as a bonus track on her fourth album ""Just One Night"". Interesting.What else could have been included on this re-release? ""Givin' Me A Hard Time"" was recorded as a b-side song during the sessions for this album. As was ""Too Late To Say Goodbye"", which was re-recorded and used on Jason Donovan's debut album. These 2 tracks would have been preferable to the extended and remixed versions of the singles that appear here.Samantha Fox's voice on this album is not as good as it was on her previous two efforts and tracks like ""Ready For This Love"", ""Walking on Air"" and ""Out of our Hands"" unfortunately highlight this fact. Some of the material is not suitable for Samantha's range either and a few of the songs could have been shortened by losing repeated (poor) takes of choruses, ""Ready For This Love"" being the greatest offender.""Hot For You"" could have been released as a single too and Samantha herself at the time said this was the sound she wanted to persue on her next album. History tells another story. The follow-up would comprise some Full Force tracks with Samantha guesting (or should that be groaning), probably just a little too much sexual innuendo for some and the record company deciding to pull the plug.""I Wanna Have Some Fun"" has some good tracks on it and a variety of musical styles to suit all tastes. Fans of Samantha Fox should pick this up as well as those who like fun, easy listening, 80s music. I Wanna Have Some Fun is 50 minutes and 59 seconds long and was released in 1988. I Wanna Have Some Fun reached #37 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Charts and went Gold. Two songs from the album charted in the United States. The album is a mixture of dance club and pop music. Her version of I Only Wanna Be With You is a good cover song. However, Dusty Springfield version is the best and charted higher then anybody else. The songs on this album are great and Samantha Fox get an A.Side OneI Wanna Have Some Fun#8 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesLove HouseYour House Or My HouseNext To MeReady For This LoveConfessionSide TwoI Only Wanna Be With You#31 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesYou Started SomethingOne In A MillionWalking On AirHot For YouOut of Our Hands I loved this cd because every song has a party feel and if you like Dance Music and love women or a particular woman in your life,...go for this cd album! Her Third Gold Album ,A Dance Album,No Bad Songs On Album,Its A Favorite Of Mine I bought this album on the strength of &quot;Just One Night&quot;.  I wish I hadn't.  It isn't near as good as the other album.  It's excessively generic.  The only song that I actually look forward to hearing on it is &quot;I Only Wanna Be With You&quot;.  One song out of the whole CD.  Unless you're a major Samantha Fox fan (in which case you already have this), don't waste your money.  Get &quot;Just One Night&quot; instead.  &quot;Oh, wait!  There goes Barbara Bush!  Miss Bush?  Miss Bush?&quot;  :) This is one of Sam's best albums and probably will be the one that people remember her by. It starts off with the song that almost everyone knows &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun.&quot; Next is &quot;Love House&quot; one of my  favorite Sammy songs. &quot;Your House Or My House&quot; is sure to get  your party going and &quot;Ready For This Love&quot; is perky pop of the  best kind. &quot;Next To Me&quot; is a laid back ditty that sounds good  anyway you listen to it. Sam's remake &quot;I Only Wanna Be With You&quot;  has become a classic for her (I still hear it on the radio 11 years  later!), and the rest of the CD is just as good. This album really  surprised a lot of people who didn't believe in Sam, but this album helped  prove them wrong. Some people might see some difficulties with the mix of all kind of styles on this album, but personally I don't mind because I think it works: you find producers like Stock Aitken Waterman, Full Force and others here. So you have pop-tracks like ""Hot for you"" and ""Walk on air"" plus R&B tracks like ""I wanna have some fun"". You can see that Sam did this album when she was still enjoying fame, because it's an album full of good songs - like she picked all the goodies for herself from the producers. Well done The albums before this were slight flirtation of pop dance fun, but this album brings it all home.  Samantha brings her talents to the table big  time on this album which is just more than straightforward dance excess.  It's full of new kinds of music that will move you in some way.  It's a  dance movement rather than just some record.Sam's biggest hits come Full  Force and courtesy of the group as well with the femme fatales call to  party in &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun&quot;.  I think maybe the single edit  works better because a back ground singer saying those few lines just makes  the song drag.  Still it's a pretty cool song with R&amp;B pop hooks.  Samantha also makes some heat on the super sexy &quot;Next To Me&quot; with  Full Force working as a background group.  It's energy in R&amp;B form as  she sings &quot;touch me baby&quot; and Full Force echoing &quot;I Need To  Feel Your Body&quot;.  It's not &quot;Touch Me&quot; but a new dance  groove.  The innocent but naughty fun pop of songs like &quot;Love  House&quot; and &quot;Your House or My House&quot; brings American house  and British pop together.  Even more cutesy dance tunes can be found like  on Stock, Atiken and Waterman soundalikes such as the blissful  &quot;Walking On Air&quot; and &quot;Ready For This Love&quot;.  The SAW  team actually work their magic on two tracks.  Most notably a very peppy  &quot;I Only Want To Be With You&quot;.  Three of the most experimental  tracks are really the best.  The pure rock and roll excess on this strictly  pop album of &quot;Hot For You&quot; is a nice touch.  Sounds like  something that would have made &quot;Touch Me&quot; a better debut.  The  co-written &quot;Confession&quot; is an out of mind dance record with  experimental beats that just can't be classified as dance pop.  It's got an  electronic edge and the lyrics are very sharp.  It's the smartest song on  the album.  Thank you, Sam.  The ender is the tradition two albums strong  of Samantha.  A big powerful ballad that her little voice manages to lift  up.  In this case it's the near ethereal meets eighties hook sound of  &quot;Out Of Our Hands&quot;.  You'd be surprised how effectively she sings  her.Another great Samantha Fox album.  She really diversified herself  into many areas on this 12 tracker that her shorter albums just couldn't  reach.  You always felt there was some lacking, but not her. Listen to it  and fall in love with Sam and her eighties dance grooves.","R&B,House,Soul,Pop,Dance & Electronic,Dance Pop,Blues",cd wanna fun love house house house next ready love confession wanna started someting one million walking air hot hands dont cheat lovin dont grow trees wanna single edit late say goodbye giving hard time shout ready lovecd love house black pyramid mix house house extended version wanna extended version wanna fun extended version lovin dont grow trees extended version love house chicago house jam mix wanna mix wanna fun sample fun mix love house coldest mix wanna ff remix love house dj pierre club mix wanna fun alternative fun mix love house cool mix wanna instrumental quot wanna fun quot samantha fox seriously masterpiece combines fun club rnb like quot wanna fun quot quot next cd wan fun love love house house house house ready love confession wan started walking air hot hands cheat dont grow trees wan single single edit late say goodbye hard hard time time shout ready love love house house black black pyramid pyramid mix house house extended version wan extended version wan fun extended version dont grow trees extended version love love house house chicago chicago house house jam mix wan mix wan fun sample fun mix love love house house mix wan remix love love house house dj dj pierre pierre club club mix mix wan fun alternative fun mix love love house house cool mix wan instrumental quot wan fun quot samantha samantha fox fox seriously masterpiece combines fun fun club club rnb quot wan fun quot quot
187,392,B0000004V0,"Kool Moe Dee was part of a seminal Hip Hop group from the 1980's called The Treacherous Three.  From these recordings you could tell that Kool Moe Dee had potential to be a breakout star.  He is the inventor of more rhyme formulas than anyone else in rap history.  From the fast rhyming style on ""New Rap Language"", to breaking rhymes down syllabically, introducing uncommon vocabulary, matching subject to verb properly, popularizing battle techniques with old rivals from Busy Bee to LL, and so forth and so on.  Kool Moe Dee is also a scholar in emcee studies.  On the inside of an earlier albums liner notes, he introduced Hip Hop's first (and maybe only) report card where he graded emcees on specific categories (vocab, stage presence, vocal presence, flow, lyrics, originality, etc...).  In other words, Moe Dee takes his work very seriously and this album is his finest solo work.  In fact, his finest lyrical performance may very well be ""I Go To Work"".  Personally, this belongs in a trinity alongside Rakims ""Lyrics of Fury"" and Kool G Raps ""Men At Work"" as master works of lyrical craftsmanship.  He also values knowledge as exemplified by the albums title track.  This was a song that enlightened many minds at the time to not fall into ignorance which is so easy to do without doing the knowledge first.  The lyricism is very impressive and you can tell that Moe Dee is a very well educated man (I believe he has a masters in communications).  The production from Teddy Riley is funky but at times it can be pre-new jack swingness which doesn't always do justice for a lyricist of Moe Dee's caliber.  Overall, this is Kool Moe Dee at his finest lyrically with some of his most accessible production even if at times the beats may alienate fans who leans towards harder back drops. Came just on time. Perfect gift for my mother who loves all the original rappers. Have to chime in and say that this truly is a lost classic.  Knowledge is King came out right as the Old School was transitioning into the powerful (yet fatally flawed) Gangsta Rap era.  It is definately not as playful as older rap albums, but KMD comes across strong and hard without the tired gimmicks (guns, b*tches, etc.) that defined his followers.  On top of decent beats, he's as lyrically gifted as the D.O.C.  If you like this era but aren't familiar with this one, buy it and you won't be disappointed. This,too me, is Kool Moe Dee most complete LP. Sure 'How ya like me know, had it good cuts, Funke,Funke wisdom ditto, but this LP was on point. It's conscious lyrics, great production(mostly Teddy Riley)are worth the price alone. Tpo cuts are: They want Money,The Avenue, I go to work, Knowledge is King, and pump your fist. Go enjoy. This is the first album I ever got of Kool Mo Dee's. His albums are hard to find in stores. Anyways, this album represents an interesting scenario, since Mo Dee is old-old school (starting in the late 70's with The Treacherous Three), and this his third solo album, in which the world of Hiphop had changed drastically beforehand in '87,'88, and '89. So it's interesting to see if he's still relevant in those changed times.The album actually began with 3 of the first 4 tracks being lighter and less serious than expected (excluding ""I Go To Work"" of course), but even these songs have messages denouncing women's materialistic ways, and declaring he wants a woman with a strong mind and personality. ""I Go To Work,"" if you didn't know, is one of the best songs of his career. This one has superb lyrics covering his approach to this craft and some battle rhymes (KMD is one of the all-time greats at battling). I usually prefer mellow music, but ""I Go To Work"" just gets me AMPED! Otherwise, the remaining six tracks are all serious and brilliant in their own ways. Still, the highlights out of these are the title track (great rhymes promoting intellect and study), ""Get The Picture,"" ""I'm Blowing Up,"" and the last ""Pump Your Fist""(promoting black pride and denouncing drugs; a true gem from this era). You will have to listen to all these over and over to catch everything.Kool Mo Dee is known as the prelude to Rakim, in that he raised the bar lyrically and how he rhymed every sentence. And this is the work he did after Rakim & a few others had advanced the Hiphop art. Kool Mo Dee's vocabulary is vast, maybe the best I've ever heard in a rapper. He still uses his old-old school style of shouting over flowing, but I think he sped it up a little in this album to adjust with the times. His voice sounds a lot like Ced-Gee's from the Ultramagnetic MC's, or it should be said the other way around based on KMD's legacy. The musical backgrounds usually hit pretty hard, and have aged well, and there were even some rock elements included in a couple of the songs.It's funny how I bought this album right before I bough Mos Def's brand new album ""The New Danger,"" and it all sounds good to me. I don't need to play this one over and over again just to understand what was going on in '89 compared to modern day stuff, or vice-versa. Hiphop at its best is timeless! Kool Mo Dee himself stated in his book (""There's A God On The Mic"") that this is his best work. I recommend getting this because Kool Mo Dee is one of the pioneers before Rakim, before KRS-One, before Big Daddy Kane, and he proves he's still relevant in a time when those three were kings. His music still offers valuable insight today, and his legacy and contributions to Hiphop are irrefutable! I really like Kool Moe Dee's flow on his album's. I bought the CD as a replacement for the cassette that I used to own back in the day. I have been looking for this CD for 7 years.  I had the CD but had a fire and everything was destroyed.  I remember playing this CD over and over and over until I learned all the words to the song knowledge is king.  This CD is is not only old school rap but and inspiration to all people no matter what race, color or creed. This Cd is wonderful and everyone all ages should listen, retain and study and apply it to everyday life and it's situation(s).  This is the very best CD.Joi from Philly I Remember Having This On Cassette; &#34;They Want Money&#34; Would Be My Perfect Driving Music,If I Had A Car,That Is. Way back in the days when rap was inventive and meant something, there was Kool Moe Dee.  Blowing the roof off of nearly every other rapper around.  Always taking the high ground, never stooping to gangsta posturing or pretty-boy posing, he came at you with an amazing ability to  rhyme and poignant subjects that make today's rap look just plain silly.  It's a shame rap had to be co-opted by tough-guy-wannabes and pointless  airheads, because Moe Dee could still be topping the charts today.  A  forgotten legend. Kool Moe Dee...what more can I say. By far, Knowledge Is King, is his best work. Before there was Nas, there was Rakim, before there was Rakim, there was KOOL MOE DEE. As a member of the Treacherous Three, he was the creator/innovator of being ""lyrical."" He is the reason why I wanted to be a serious MC. K.I.K represents many facets of a well-balanced display of lyrical contact, music and song structure. I still enjoy this album till this day. My favorite song is ""the avenue."" However,""I go to work"" and the title track, are superb. I don't beleive that the ""average rap fan"" understands MOE DEE's legacy. Overall, the L.L battle may have had an effect on his influence on Hip Hop. Based on the fact, that because L.L (who is also one of the greats) had a longer lasting career and it's probably safe to say, that he also made better records than his counter part; people think that he may have won the battle. But, if they would have ever met head to head, on stage, rhyme for rhyme...KOOL MOE DEE would have been victorious. What L.L brought to the culture of battling, was that he added other components to the battle, such as record sells, sex appeal, money etc. Prior to this period, battling was about rhymes, lyrics, wittiness etc. MOE DEE is indeed a Master. One of the greatest of all-times. Prior to the coming of Rakim, KOOL MOE DEE was the best. My top 5 overall influences- Rakim, KRS-One, Big Daddy Kane, Kool Moe Dee, Kool G. Rap. Moe Dee should probably be first, because he is the reason why I wanted to MC, back in 1981. Treacherous Three is my favorite group from the pioneer period of hip hop (79-85) From New Rap Language, At the party, The Body Rock, Put the Boogie in your body, Feel the Heartbeat, Yes we Can, Action, Get Up, X-mas Rap, We'll Turn you on, Gotta Rock, Turn it up etc. They always represented lyrical excellence. They were like three solo MC's together in a group. Anyway, Long live KOOL MOE DEE. Your presence is missed. PEACE..... r.l.will.sun I'm giving this 5 stars on the strenth of track 3 alone...&quot;I Go to Work&quot; is an absolute lyrical masterpiece, it seriously stands up as strong as Eric B and Rakim's &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; (and any head  will tell you that's a TALL order)...Kool Moe Dee is best on this record  when he's hitting the uptempo battle rhymes like &quot;I Go to Work&quot;  but he's also strong on his serious tracks like &quot;Knowledge is  King&quot; and the venomous &quot;Pump Ya Fist&quot;...even the  no-I-ain't-got-no-girlfriend track (&quot;They Want Money&quot;) works as  well at a party as it does in headphones.A record which deserves to be  better known than it is, coming from the Golden Age of Hip hop, when you  had to be NASTY on the mic to get a record deal.","Old School,Pop Rap,Soul,Pop,East Coast,R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Blues",kool moe dee part seminal hip hop group called treacherous three recordings could tell kool moe dee potential breakout star inventor rhyme formulas anyone else rap history fast rhyming style new rap language breaking rhymes syllabically introducing uncommon vocabulary matching subject verb properly popularizing battle techniques old rivals busy bee forth kool moe dee also scholar emcee studies inside earlier liner notes introduced hip hops first maybe report card graded emcees specific categories vocab stage presence vocal presence flow lyrics originality etc words moe dee takes work seriously finest solo work fact finest lyrical performance may well go work personally belongs trinity alongside rakims lyrics fury kool g rap kool moe dee moe dee seminal hip hip hop hip hop group hop group group called called treacherous recordings tell kool moe dee moe dee potential breakout star inventor rhyme formulas anyone else rap history fast rhyming style new rap language breaking rhymes syllabically introducing uncommon vocabulary matching subject verb properly popularizing battle techniques old rivals busy busy bee bee forth kool moe dee moe dee scholar emcee studies earlier liner liner notes notes introduced hip hip hops hops maybe report report card card graded emcees specific categories stage presence vocal presence flow lyrics originality words moe dee work seriously solo work fact lyrical performance work personally belongs trinity rakims lyrics fury kool g rap g rap rap
188,393,B0000004V2,"Since the Stone Roses were the nominal leaders of Britain's ""Madchester"" scene -- an indie rock phenomenon that fused guitar pop with drug-fueled rave and dance culture -- it's rather ironic that their eponymous debut only hints at dance music. What made the Stone Roses important was how they welcomed dance and pop together, treating them as if they were the same beast. Equally important was the Roses' cool, detached arrogance, which was personified by Ian Brown's nonchalant vocals. Brown's effortless malevolence is brought to life with songs that equal both his sentiments and his voice -- ""I Wanna Be Adored,"" with its creeping bassline and waves of cool guitar hooks, doesn't demand adoration, it just expects it. Similarly, Brown can claim ""I Am the Resurrection"" and lie back, as if there were no room for debate. But the key to The Stone Roses is John Squire's layers of simple, exceedingly catchy hooks and how the rhythm section of Reni and Mani always imply dance rhythms without overtly going into the disco. On ""She Bangs the Drums"" and ""Elephant Stone,"" the hooks wind into the rhythm inseparably -- the '60s hooks and the rolling beats manage to convey the colorful, neo-psychedelic world of acid house. Squire's riffs are bright and catchy, recalling the British Invasion while suggesting the future with their phased, echoey effects. The Stone Roses was a two-fold revolution -- it brought dance music to an audience that was previously obsessed with droning guitars, while it revived the concept of classic pop songwriting, and the repercussions of its achievement could be heard throughout the '90s, even if the Stone Roses could never achieve this level of achievement again.I love all the songs. I really can't add anything that hasn't been said already on here by others.  Just pick this disc up, its absolutely brilliant music.  The best example of Madchester ever!! One of the most influential Brit rock albums and a classic. Captivating is a word that comes to mind. This album has the power to move one to another plateau. The dreamy psychedelic irreverence of each magical track builds into a finale that is the unforgettable &quot;I am the Resurrection&quot;. The Stone Roses - the band that has influenced so many and shaped music to what it is today. Will they one day be resurrected and rule the earth again? We can only hope. From the opening track, ""I Want To Be A Dog"" to the blasphemous finale - ""I am an erection"", this album struts along the dandy-lions like butter dripping on lead.Absolute rubbish if I was being honest, I'd rather eat a can of worms than listen to this nonsense again. The 2nd track ""He who bangs the drums"" was awful, it reminded me of everything that was bad about the 80s: shiny guitars, reeling drums, and a singer who sounds like a cross between Ricky Steve and Bobby Carlton.Don't waste your time lads. Go and check out those heady early days when E.L.O. lit Lucy in the pie with diamonds. Spiffing! In a word. I couldn't get enough of this album when it was first released.  It still manages to move me almost 20 years later. An immediate jolt of music-prozac for whenever I'm feeling down.  It is indeed too bad about the subsequent years, but does that really matter? If any of us could shine this brightly albeit for a short time, we'd be there in a heartbeat [and yes, the sound is ""tinny""]. In 1989, a band from Manchester, England named the Stone Roses released a self-titled album that became a smash in their homeland. Before Oasis, Radiohead and Coldplay came along, there were the Stone Roses, and they were a *phenomenon*. John Squire was an instant guitar-god, Ian Brown had a singing voice that could easily melt you, Gary Mounfield was a solid bassist, and the drummer known only as Reni was nothing short of fantastic. Oh yeah, and they also wrote fantastic songs, shimmering beauties that perfectly mixed rock, pop, funk, dance, psychedelia, and acoustic stuff. And all in one album! And although the Roses never got beyond cult status in the States, their self-titled debut remains a landmark album in British rock history. From the opening ""I Wanna Be Adored,"" ""She Bangs The Drums"" and ""Elephant Stone,"" to the halfway point of ""Elizabeth My Dear"" (all 59 seconds of it), ""(Song For My) Sugar Spun Sister"" and ""Made Of Stone,"" to the brilliant extended tracks of ""I Am The Resurection"" and the GROOVY ""Fools Gold,"" this album is a mindblower. As other reviewers have pointed out, every note played and sung is absolutely perfect. Sadly, when the promotional duties for the album were finally finished, the Stone Roses got tangled up in legal hassles with their record label, preventing them from releasing another album for five years. The second album, ""Second Coming,"" finally arrived in 1994, and it, too, was brilliant (and it was also the album that made me a Roses fan, t'boot), but it wasn't received anywhere near as well as the first album, and the band fell apart shortly afterwards. Their lifespan was much too brief, but ALL the current hot British bands of the day owe a great debt of some form or another to the Stone Roses for helping to forge the path with this all-time classic 1989 release. The Stone Roses burst out of nowhere in 1989 changing music and youth culture in Britain forever. From the slow build up of the opening ""I wanna be adored"" to the chart storming ""Fools Gold"" the album doesn't have a bad track; it's an astonishing debut. Considering that it is a debut, the self-confidence and downright cockiness of the band is amazing, they truly believed that they were the best band in the world - and for a short time they were. John Squire's guitar work is brilliant throughout and ""Fools Gold"" spawned a rash of inferior copycat bands. Some of the music is not totally original though. When Morrissey was asked to give a one word summation of 1989 he replied ""1969"" - he may have had a point. I always think of ""eight miles high"" by The Byrds as the first real ""Madchester"" tune. Nonetheless, ""The Stone Roses"" is one of the all time classic albums that everyone should own. Before the Stone Roses, indie kids and dance kids hated each other, but here was a band that fit into both categories and in turn made a whole new area of music accessible to both groups. It's difficult to pick out recommendations from such a great album, but ""I wanna be adored"", ""She bangs the drum"", ""Waterfall"", ""I am the resurrection"" and ""Fools Gold"" are really worth checking out. You won't regret buying a copy of the Stone Roses. It has to be the greatest debut album of all time. The opening sequence will run shivers down your spine as I Wanna Be Adored builds up to a melody so tranquil you will lose yourself immediately in the album.Progressing through the melowness of the opener and track 2, Waterfall, we are hit by track 3, in my opinion the best on the album, She Bangs the Drum. This song will hit you with a vengence. The fast paced bassline is pure class.After this we wander through the record at varying speeds. Always taking you along for the ride with the littlest of effort.In all, this has to be in the top 10 records ever made! Not a bad track and they are all arranged in a perfect order.Do not hesitate to add this to your collection. In 1989, the Stone Roses paved the way for countless Britpop, Madchester, dance-rock and indie-rock bands with this one, universally appealing, classic debut. They never came anyone near bettering it and that's no surprise seeing some of the brilliant tracks here.Opener 'I Wanna Be Adored' is a magnificent fusion of a pounding, driving rhythm section, an almost oriental guitar line and Ian Brown's melodic, sustained voice. Throughout the CD all the other classics are visited - 'She Bangs The Drums' - pure euphoria in a fantastic pop song, a classic melody with meandering bass - 'Waterfall' - a Manchester anthem for decades to come - 'Made of Stone' - my very favourite - a psychadelic, swirling rock song with an unmistakable riff, a mysterious, beckoning verse and a classic tune in the chorus, and winding up at the 11-minute brilliant work that is 'I Am The Resurrection' - a pretty cool tune, but after 4 minutes it flows into a mad, hynotic, genius instrumental section - and that is what is most exciting.The Stone Roses never did anything else half this good (except for maybe the single Fools Gold). But I'm happy with this as proof that they were one of the most influential, important bands ever and this CD is one of the true classics. Have not had the chance to hear this band really from radio...so I bought the &#34;best of&#34; and listened to it in my car. They are good as you have read the reviews... Well, what can I say about this album that hasn't already been said?The first time I heard this album; within the first twenty seconds of the first track, I knew this was going to be something special, and I wasn't wrong.  Every track on this album is pop perfection; why can't music be like this anyomore?If it wasn't for this album, there wouldn't have been oasis, ocean colour scene, the stereophonics, and just about every indie guitar band of the 90s!!!Has any album been so significant and influential?  I doubt it, top marks from me!!! Another reviewer said that the US and UK versions are identical. This is not true. The US version contains a 13th track--Fools Gold. OK I only want to make one key point: When this album was made, Elephant Stone was never on it, neither was Fools Gold. Elephant Stone was a previous single recorded entirely separaely a year beforehand, by a different producer. Fools Gold was recorded over 6 months later in a completely different vein, and whilst Fools Gold is a track that truely shook the world, it must be considered separately. So boys and girls please BUY THE ORIGINAL 46 minute album with the original 11 tracks on it, as the band originally intended. Why ? Well all the rave reviews and plaudits are from that original format. If ever there was a record that was made as one, as a complete journey using various styles cleverly joined together and immaculately paced, this, is it.I'll leave all the plaudits to the thousands of others online - this is a unique record that speaks for itself.Download the original 11 track album and let it enrich the rest of your life. I fell in love with ""I Wanna Be Adored"" on the radio, long ago. It was only recently that I thought about what else the Stone Roses may have put out... another case of ""I waited too long!"" I read reviews on Amazon, and decided to buy the first album, rather than the ""Complete Stone Roses."" I am SO glad I did. This album is pretty much perfect. I can listen to it straight through and have quickly learned the lyrics to almost every song. I believe I'll be adding this album to my ""Top 5"" list. I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking to hear something with more depth and passion than the majority of the crap that's being played on the radio right now. When I first heard this debut record from Manchester's Stone Roses I was completely blown away.  I remember first listening to it during the summer of 1989 and thinking that this was the best band I had heard in a very, very long time.  I originally purchased this record on 12&quot; vinly and wore it out long ago.  I replaced it with a CD and I am now on my second copy as someone stole the original after I played it at a party.  Not only is it still the best debut record that I have ever heard, I firmly believe that it belongs among the best albums of the last 25 years.  To this day this album still stands the test of time. Remember that this record was originally released in the spring of 1989.  There is no weak track on this record. John Squire's guitar playing is simply awesome.  As a fellow drummer I was simply mesmorized by Reni's drumming.  Reni is perhaps the most innovative drummer I have heard since Keith Moon. Although not the greatest live singer, Ian Brown's vocals ooze so much confidence it is obvious why Noel and Liam Gallagher of Oasis were so inspired by this band.  The bass guitarist Mani provides the backbone to the band. Please give this record a listen, I can assure you that you will not regret it! i fell in love listening to i wanna be adored.completly beautiful.listen and love. What more can be said about this self titled review?  This album is absolutely perfect from the beginning to the end.  There is absolutely no filler and each song can stand on its own.The album opens heroically with &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; and only hints at what is to come.  &quot;She Bangs the Drums&quot; is pure bliss from start to finish, not to mention the infectuous &quot;Waterfall&quot; with a guitar riff that would put AC/DC to shame. Theres the psychedelic &quot;Don't Stop&quot; which slowly crawls from out of your speakers, not to mention &quot;This is the One&quot; which is a great sing along.More importantly than the songs themselves is the feel of the entire album as a whole. Its the perfect sound to uplift your spirits.  Reni's drumming is fast paced and very danceable, not to mention John Squire's guitar work, which is most prominent and worthy of praise on &quot;I am the Resurrection&quot;, in which he goes on a 5 minute tangent of guitar trickery and effects.The self titled stands out on its own because of its fresh melodic approach and is worth investing in because its very catchy, yet it doesnt repeat itself.Simply put: it was released in 1989, yet its still as fresh and relevent today as it was then.  This album will never get old and tired. Absolutely extraordinary. To my mind this is the definitive piece of modern music of the last 20 years. All the more remarkable that it should come from a band that seemingly vanished as quickly as it appeared.It's hard to describe this album. There are several threads that work together; Each dark brooding lyric comes coupled with a soaring anthemic melody. You have airy psychedelica and no-nonsense consumate rock simultaneously. Moreover this record is a complete article - there's a groove to this work that ties each song to the next - I never shuffle this CD...each component is already in the right place. Almost 15 years after I bought CD it continues to be the mainstay of my collection - the one record that continues to spin regularly and the one I've turned the car around for again and again.This is my favourite record of all time. Buy it. Rip it and then pack it away carefully for your offspring. Think ""London Calling"", ""Revolver"", ""The Bends"", ""What's Going On"". It's in that space of utter quality. This is a group I had never heard of until researching &#34;best of &#34; albums. Their rock and roll style is inventive. Unfortunately the recording solution they had available isn't kind to CD, plenty of digititus. hope I can find an LP at a reasonable price somewhere The Stone Roses magically came together and and recorded this one perfect album. The fact that they never put out anything else that matters is irrelevant. Very few bands achieve perfection like this. After all these years, there still aren't many albums that I have listened to more than this one. It will always be in my All-Time Top 10. This album is so timelessly perfect that it simply could not have been constructed by mere mortals alone.  My theory is that the Roses were practicing one night in a garage, dreaming of glory and stardom.  Lucifer appeared and made a proposal.  He would give them the talent to create some of the most perfect music ever heard, in exchange for their everlasting souls.  The catch is that the talent was fleeting.  After this magnificent album, the dark prince revoked it.  Nothing like this would ever be heard again from the same musicians.  He even went so far as to remove the gift of voice that he had granted to Ian Brown, who is now left partially tone-deaf.  It remains to be seen whether Satan still has title to their souls.  Regardless, this album is in the same league as Eine Kleine Nachtmusic, Abbey Road, and other precious few works of sheer artistic genius.  Unfortunately, it does not share the same recognition as those works, due mainly to the deal with Satan.  However, I believe that future generations will rediscover this album and treasure it as we do now with other classical greats who were ahead of their time. If you buy one album this millenium, all month and a half, or even the next millenium, make it this one. It is a mixture of blasting indie tunes,  such as This Is The One and She Bangs The Drums, and tinkling melodies such  as I wanna be adored and Made of Stoone, not to mention the thunderous  chorus of I am The Resurrection. This is a highly acclaimed album and  deservedly so, so buy it as soon as you can, and buy it from OUR PRICE in  NELSON, 12.99. or get that at Nirvana MTV Unplugged, for 22 in the  current campaign. This album is really a masterpiece! I allways think of what my top ten/five albums of all time are and this GEM allways makes it. If u like this check out, 'The La's'- they only made 1 album, and Paul Weller's, 'Wild Wood' these three albums could have made the 60's stay FOREVER! Casting back to 1989, it seems strange not to remember the exact moment  this album first enchanted the ears. Today, of course, it's a  permanent fixture of my musical conscience. It touches places  in the heart you never knew existed, and the way it speaks to so many  different emotions is almost frightening. Some of the best music  communicates what we already know. Then there is music that changes the way  we listen to music--forever. This record is both. On first  listen, these songs probably won't strike you as original or  ground-breaking. The Byrds done by four lads from Manchester? Well, watch your back. Every song here is a fierce grower.  Squire's guitar always works in service of the tune. His sense of  melody is flawless. Even Brown's modest voice announces itself with utter  confidence. Ultimately, though, it's Reni's crisp, shuffled beats that make  it all so distintive--like a jazz drummer who happened upon a rock band  rehearsal, then folded it all together with effortless style.  This self-titled debut is endlessly fascinating, unfailingly engaging. The  towering singles--""She Bangs The Drums,"" ""Elephant  Stone,"" ""Fool's Gold""--are all here, but so are the  heaven-sent ""Don't Stop"" and ""My Sugar-Spun Sister."" If you've always been cynical of the hype surrounding British bands this could  change your mind forever. Only hearts of stone will fail to be moved. The Stone Roses made only one good album, but what a great album it is!  Imagine if Beatles of 1964 were reincarnated twenty-five years later.  That's how good this album is.  The songwriting is absolutely first rate.  The Roses have what could be called a &quot;modern rock&quot; sound and  just enough of a snotty atitude to give their songs some bite.  One song,  &quot;Elizabeth My Dear,&quot; concerns the assassination of the Queen.  Another is actually called &quot;I am the Resurrection.&quot;  Clearly, the  lads do not lack self-confidence, or talent.  Their anthology albums are  either redundant or water this album's greatness down with tracks from the  band's mediocre second album.  Go with this one, one of the best rock  albums of the late 1980s, instead. With over 200 reviews I'd say this review is just filler at this point. So let me just add that this is as close to perfection as, say, Echo & the Bunnymen's Heaven Up Here is.The other thing that gets me every time I listen to this album is how a band can do an over eight-minute song (""I am the Resurrection"") that is not only presumptuous (let's face it this song is about the Stone Roses' sound resurrecting a Brit music scene that was in a post-punk down cycle) but rocks out.Throw in the buildup to ""I Wanna Be Adored,"" the breath Ian Brown takes before ""Sugar Spun Sister"" starts to John Squire's transcendent guitar playing and this is an album that will hold up for decades. This album, simply put, is stunning. In my humble opinion it has to be the best, most wonderful, debut album by a band ever. &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; is a haunting and sublime blend of songs; a seminal work that  defines (and is a yardstick for) urban British bands of the '90s like Oasis  and Pulp. &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; is one of the best opening tunes  for a record. Its slow fade in, with a soft cacophony of noise effects,  gives way to one of the most memorable bass riffs ever. The listener has  goosebumps well before the song kicks in - lyrically, it's a simple  repitition of verses, but lines like &quot;I don't have to sell my soul,  he's already in me&quot; haunt you. Religious imagery is a distinctive  feature of the Stone Roses' music - sometimes it is reverent, sometimes it  is laced with spiritual sexuality. Could it be crisiticed as blasphemous?  This depends on your sensitivity - myself, I believe this mixture of images  to be no more profane than the Song of Solomon. The theme continues with  &quot;She Bangs the Drums&quot;, both a danceable pop song and also a  celebration of love and spirituality. &quot;Waterfall&quot; is in the same  vein, while &quot;Don't Stop&quot; showcases the experimental talents of  the band. Musically it is &quot;Waterfall&quot; played backwards, lyrically  it is somewhat abstract, but by no means pretentious. Following directly  after it makes a terrific impact. This album is hard to fault - &quot;Bye  Bye Badman&quot; has a jaunty, poppy tune which belies nasty lyrics  (&quot;I have bad intentions, I intend to knock you down&quot;) while  &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot; is a vicious attack on the monarchy -  performed in under a minute to the tune of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;.  Listening to &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; you can tell that the band is  heavily influenced by the Beatles without being a carbon copy - especially  with &quot;(Song for my) Sugar Spun Sister&quot; and &quot;Made of  Stone&quot;. The latter song is the album's first single. It is another  haunting piece, seemingly dominated by images of dying in a car crash.  &quot;Shoot You Down&quot; has gentle and subtle guitar work from John  Squire. &quot;This is the One&quot; is wonderful while &quot;I Am the  Resurrection&quot; is a downright epic - a three minute verbal tirade which  changes into a funk style instrumental. At the end you can't believe you've  been listening to the same song for eight minutes. For an album like this  it is difficult to express exactly how brilliant it is - the spiritual  energy is inspiring, the music complementing Ian Brown's haunting vocals.  Just listen to it. You won't be sorry. Unbelievably brilliant, well ahead of it's time!  I can't get Waterfall out of my head.  I'm only sorry that I didn't clue into this band when they made this album but I don't think I would have been mature enough to appreciate it's brilliance.  Rarely in the history of music do collaborative artists produce such magic together squire/brown have made a masterpiece.  It's shocking that they didn't produce much more material together, but I can think of 100's of bands that have 10's of albums out and not one of them equal this.  John Squire's guitar and Brown's vocal are a match made in heaven.  If the legacy of The Stone Roses is this and very little else then so be it, at least they went out on a figurative and no doubt literal high. For those who missed Madchester period, a good way to discover one of the 10th best album of the past century. it doesn't matter if you were around in 1989 to know about this.  frankly, it's just too damn good to ever ignore.  most people who enjoy music (here comes a sweeping generalization) want either to be able to dance to it or they want a good piece of songwriting.  to be honest, it's a superhuman task to reconcile these two qualities.  that's where the stone roses came in.  i mean you could dance to elvis, but who wants to look like their parents anyway?  if you've never heard this album, think of what would happen if you crossed duran duran (assuming you like them) and the beatles.  it's crazy stuff indeed.  &quot;i wanna be adored&quot; was the first song i loved, and it's hard not to with its throbbing bassline implying a subtle dance beat, layered with some catchy guitar riffs.  not to mention the rock'n'roll arrogance that pervades the album.  who else can pull off singing &quot;you adore me,&quot; or &quot;i am the resurrection,&quot; with such nonchalance as to wholly expect nobody to disagree.  and not a soul will speak up.  there are more classic pop pleasures here, notably on &quot;elephant stone&quot; and &quot;she bangs the drums&quot; but that rhythm section keeps things fresh with the dance thing.  &quot;made of stone&quot; is perhaps the most harrowing song on the album, and it stands out a bit, though not it a bad way.  musically, it flows very well.  some songs do resonate more over time, such as &quot;fools gold&quot; the most dancy track here, again pulled off with that familiar swagger that exudes brilliance, but every song is monumental and necessary.  it's hard to fault the band for never really matching this again, though their follow up is largely ignored and unjustly so.  too much hype surrounded this debut because it kickstarted an entire ecstasy-dance-madchester-whatever movement.  the album was so good it stood up to that hype and kicked it around a little, but no group could ever follow this up.  what does that mean to you then?  if you like music at all, you must at least give this a chance.  i don't think i could say that for any other album.  this could potentially satisfy anyone who really loves music, and it's something that may never be repeated again.  too much praise?  maybe.  judge for yourself, if you're skeptical. Amid the buzz of the late 80s Manchester ""Baggy"" scene,The Stone Roses looked just right and had just enough decent tunes for a massive British press hype, but the music on this record was otherwise frankly average. 60s psychedelia merged with 80s indie shoegazing (a very unorigional combination even at the time of release)heralded as genius. Had they come from another part of the world other than Manchester they probably would have dissappeared into obscurity. It seems that the group themselves had no idea why the public had got so excited about this album and so took 6 years before managing to release another. When the 2nd album was released the press hype machine had long gone elsewhere and so it bombed and they split up. Its not a bad record but its nothing special. Dont believe the hype. Hard to believe this is over 20 years old. Putting this remastered version of The Stone Roses on the stereo was instant heaven once again, only this time heaven looked, and sounded, even better.First off I'll say that Ian and co. did a great job on the packaging. Giving this release some much needed heft (it is heavy) They not only boosted the demo tracks, LP's, booklet, art prints, and live dvd, but they did it in a very handsome package. The outer slipcase feels like a large clothbound novel, and even the lettering on the cover gets the gold stamped treatment. The real joy of course is the remastering of the debut record itself. This is not the standard rush and clip job here. Each track is handled with respect and care an album of this nature deserves. Sure the vinyl could have stretched out a bit into a double LP, but what you get is on 180, and plenty nice for anyone's picky ears. The live dvd looks and sounds better than it did, the demos (some of which even I hadn't heard till now) are amazing to hear. Again, each of the CD's levels sound great and these versions give a noticible level boost to any previous issues, all without sacrificing the quality of the mastering.In short, if you love this record (it's in my all time top 25), then I can think of no better version to own than this one. Simply superb handling of this landmark debut record in every way. The Stones Roses were innovative because they fused guitar-pop with dance and rave music. Every song here is good-if-not great, and there's even a couple classics scattered about (the hit ""She Bangs The Drum"" and ""I Wanna Be Adored"" are some). Singer Ian Brown perfectly fits the lyrics as I can't see how anybody won't like him. The lyrics are always catchy and are very much worthy of close inspection. The instrumentation is also fantastic - it's all very creative, fun and distinctively Stone Roses - they definitely have their own sound. It sounds just a tad dated, but I don't think most people will care in the end. All things aside, I'm pretty confident that pop rock and 80's rock fans will definitely love this album (along with most other people)! HIGHLY recommended!Highlights include:the entire album! i always heard so much about them- yet never had really heard them.- finally i got myself to buy this CD as it was supposedly similar to a lot of the other British music I like.  wow- its better! its the king of all  britpop and really is an all time classic.  Songs like This Is The One are  just euphoric.  The Stone Roses had a unique, amazing sound that I am mad  that I didn't discover earlier.  Truly a timeless classic. All I can say is that this reissue of one of the greatest records ever released by far exceeded my expections. If you're a vinyl addict, such as myself, and you LOVE this album, the box set is the only way to go. The audiophile that I am will not go into detail about the the subtle nuances you now notice in the remastering, but trust me, it got the much needed boost that was long overdue.The heap of bonus tracks, the artwork, the DVD that was always of medicore quality prior to this release, are all great. As you can tell, I'm very happy with this release. My ONE-AND-ONLY recommendation would've been to have a higher quality audiophile grade vinyl pressing that stretched the length of the album over two records and not limited to one. Regardless, Mr. Brown and Co. did a wonderful job with the remastering and I recommend that anybody who loves this album to at least purchase the less expensive reissue and leave the box set for the completists, like myself. This album is without question one of the best albums of the 80's or 90's.  It offers a more serious, deeper sound than most of the one hit wonder  British Bands from the 80's- and it rang in  the 90's with a sound that is  contemporary even now.  The best measure of an albums worth is how it  stands up over time. I understand why some bands never went further- i.e.  Happy Mondays or Blue Aeroplanes- but of the British Bands from that era-  The Stone Roses deserve better! Highly influential was this Manchester band, the Stone Roses.They only put two albums out in their whole 12 year career, but this one marked the Stone Roses as a very important Rock band who crafted a style that was all their own. Combining 60s guitar pop with dance beats and a bit of psychadelia. Very innovative, since no other band was doing this, with the possible exception of the Happy Mondays. Of course they were nowhere near as good.The Stone Roses s/t debut is definitely an 80s classic. One of the best from the decade. Pure Brit/Pop that re-energised the movement.A movement in which later inspired bands like Blur and Oasis. Still no one does it better than the Stone Roses! and their debut is pure gold.To me, it sounds like this record is from a band who had a seasoned career, not just a first time effort as this. One of the best debut albums I have ever heard.John Squire is a Master at the guitar, superior throughout, especially on the band's epic - ""I Am the Ressurection"" and ""Fool's Gold"" which isn't on my early used copy. The song was released on later editions and I first heard it on 'The Complete Stone Roses' album.Every song on this Cd Rocks! Not a stinker on all of these 11 or 12 tracks depending on which version you have.- ""I Wanna Be Adored"" - ""She Bangs the Drums"" - ""Made Of Stone"" & ""This Is the One"" are my highlights.If you are a fan of Rock music or just music in general and you don't have this in your collection, What are you waiting for ? Buy it. I bought this magnificent album in 1990, and still today this is on of my best records. I`ll first heard about this incredibly group in 89`(I wanna be adored), so i`d &quot;selled my soul&quot; to Stone Roses. This is just a must-album to own for everyone who loves this kind of music. Gets better on repeated listenings as great albums do. Give this one a try, even if you've not heard much of them before. Released early in the summer of '89, The Stone Roses' first album still sounds fresh and exciting nearly a quarter-century later. The songs are strangely gorgeous, almost femininely so, when compared to later Mancunian bands (Oasis is an obvious example).Kicking off with the poignant indie anthem ""I Wanna Be Adored"", this near-perfect album then breezes through eleven songs, all of them brilliant: highlights ""She Bangs the Drums"", a declaration of love and newness as tangy as the lemons on the album cover; the life-affirming ""Waterfall""; the revolution hymn ""Made of Stone""; ""This Is the One"", a tastefully bombastic song about love and starting over; and, last but not least, the screw-you anthem ""I Am the Resurrection"", which is somehow simultaneously lighthearted and viscious. The songs, skillfully written, are brought to vivid, colorful life through vocalist Ian Brown's soft, distinctive voice, John Squire's psychedelic guitar stylings, and the quirky, hard-driving rhythm section, consisting of bassist Gary ""Mani"" Mounfield and drummer Alan ""Reni"" Wren.This album is, in my opinion, rather underrated. Over here in America, you'll get blank stares if you ask most people if they've heard of The Stone Roses. They're missing out. This should be a mandatory item in any music-lover's library. I wholeheartedly recommend that you buy this album and worship it, if you haven't already. ...this is it.  An absolute masterpiece, this album played an important role in my formative years, as it surely did for many others.  In high school, I wanna be adored was something of a single.  I got the album and fell in love with it.  Once I got to college, it really struck me how this album was revered by fellow students of all types: punk-types, hippies, nerds, it seemed like everybody was touched by these songs.The 5 year hiatus, during which the Roses supposedly were wrangling with their label, only added to their mystique: these guys were legendary.  When Second Coming finally came out in '94, it wasn't universally received.  How could it have been? Kinda tough to follow one of the most highly revered musical works of the modern age.  Anyhow, the second album certainly stands as another monumental work - perhaps without the impact of the first, but a kickin' piece of (Zeppelin-esque) rockandroll...I had the pleasure of seeing one of the very few Seahorses shows, and maybe the only one in the US, at Irving Plaza in NYC a few years ago.  I recall a great set, and Chris Helme seemed like a good (in tune) frontman. Highlight of the night, however, was meeting John Squire on the street after the show.  I drew a blank when confronted with the greatness, so here's my chance to say &quot;thank you John, Ian, Reni, and Mani&quot;-CL On first listening to this album I was blown away with its intense individuality of sound and its mind blowing sucession of excellency, track after track. There truly never has been nor will there ever again be an  album which surpasses the magnificence of this, the greatest album ever. The Stone Roses (BY The Stone Roses) is a very hypnotizing album to say the least. It is almost like a crossroads between the British indie scene going on at the time, and the 1960's psychedelic scene, creating a very unique brand of alternative music that only The Smiths could have equally matched (have they not broken up before this release unfortunately :( ). This is a very diverse, exciting, and fun album, and is an ABSOLUTELY essential purchase for any music collection. ""College was a time for intellectual growth often exercised in meaningless conversations on a Tuesday night, hanging around with friends, drinking Keystone Lights, and discussing things as obscure as the greatest bass line of all time. Some people would argue such tracks like Queen's ""Under Pressure,"" The Clash's ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" and, of course, the haunting mysterious bass line from the Zeppelin classic ""Dazed and Confused."" In this hypothetical argument, the answer would have to be the bass line from ""I Wanna Be Adored"", as played by ""Mani"" Mournfield the first track off The Stone Roses stunning debut. The simple fact is that when you heard it you knew that no matter if you were doing something as mundane as studying for a Psychology 100 exam you were in for a great musical experience for the next fifty plus minutes plus."" [...] A must buy album which will provide hours of fun and entertainment whatever music your into! It contains their big hit 'Fools Gold' and my personal favourite 'I wanna Be Adored' Stop reading now and buy it! man, what a great album.  everything i type has already been said - things like &quot;i never get tire of it&quot; and &quot;pure pop brilliance&quot; - but all these things are true.  so, instead, let me just say that this album invaded my life in every way when i discovered it in 1990.  ian brown's voice made me long for travel and pretty girls.  squire's guitar made me wish i could play (i've sort of learned since).  and reni's drums just made me want to move.  i dressed like these guys.  i wore out 3 cassette tapes in 4 years.  i turned on countless friends to this album.  it is such a huge part of how i grew up, and such an influence on the music i write for myself today.on a weekly basis, i dream about these guys getting back together.  but until then, we have this ethereal, masterful, spacey and melodic collection of songs. .... and I don't.  The first couple of songs are nice enough, but the rest of it is a disjointed and inaccessible mess.  To their favor, no one can accuse them of selling out and losing their indie cred with an overproduced pop album, but there's a difference between being ""off center"" and ""way out there.""  I know many folks go bananas for the Stone Roses, but I just don't see it.  Were they an overlooked band who never got the recognition they deserved?  Not really.  They have their cult following, and that's all a band that focuses more on being cool than producing listenable songs can expect. Having heard so much about this album, I was excited to hear it for the first time. And after many listens, im not convinced that its a work of genius as everybody thinks it is. Some of the songs are great - made of stone, she bangs the drums, and i am the resurrection are the obvious standout tracks for me. But this album lacks momentum...there is hardly any passion in the execution of these songs. In other words, if I want to listen to a high energy album, im not going to stick this in my cd player.I think the guitar work is uninspiring throughout - there is nothing innovative about using the wah wah pedal. The vocals are practically non existent; maybe this was a problem with the mixing of the album, or maybe Ian Brown just cant carry a tune (probably the latter). I am baffled as to why this is considered a classic...people always talk about this album like it was a `movement`, but when it comes down to it, its the songs that count, and theyre sub standard. I think if my expectations hadnt been built up quite so much then I would enjoy this a lot more...as it stands, its a good little album, but nowhere near as good as its cracked up to be. This album was a complete revelation when it arrived in 1989.  The Smiths were sadly gone, and British rock seemed to be in a bit of a holding pattern.  This shattering debut from Manchester completely changed all that in a single listen.I still remember where I was when I first heard it in the summer of 1989.  After I picked up my jaw from the floor at the end of ""Fool's Gold"", popular demand insisted that the disc be put on ""repeat"" for the duration of a party that lasted until sunrise the next day.  It has never left my heart since that very memorable evening.So many previous reviewers have caused me to nod in agreement with their heartfelt praise, so I won't do much more but encourage casual browsers to read those previous spot-on reviews.  Cliche or not, this is a desert-island, once-in-a-lifetime, truly indispensable record.If I had one criticism, it would be that a remastering to bump up the bottom end would be welcome, as it's rather a bit trebly, and the Stone Roses rhythm section deserves to be fully audible.  Yes, the high end is crystalline and fully available to be enjoyed in all its detail, but the bass and drums could be a bit more up front.Rumors are once again swirling of a summer tour reunion ""before we're all fat and bald"", but alas, only one possible US festival appearance is mentioned.  I say a long tour with a double-superbill of a reformed Smiths and Stone Roses alternating headline billing and joining each other to guest on select songs would be by far the most exciting ticket in memory.This record is often put at the top of music magazine ""best album ever"" lists for good reason.  A list of those artists citing the Stone Roses as a significant influence would represent a mind-boggling number of album sales.  Buy this CD and understand.  Lather, listen, repeat.  You simply cannot be disappointed. This album is absolutely beautiful to say the least!  One of the best albums ever made period!  You want Brit pop, this is the cornerstone...this is the standard.  Music rarely reaches this level but when it does it is wonderful!Easily 5 stars! In 1989 I was a teenager and only interested in Heavy Metal music.  I'm glad that I can now appreciate this classic recording almost 25 years later.  I read that a few British music magazines have recently called this the greatest British recording of all time.  If this is true, I feel that they may be a little biased by the fact that this album was a part a scene that later spawned Brit-pop.  Good guitar rock. I just bought this LP for an incredible swiss girl because, trust me, this CD can bring visions of happiness to the ones who are dear to your heart. I love this album, recently purchased it like 2 months back and this cd is always in rotation in my car, theres one song i usually skip over and its the reversed track of ""Dont Stop"" not even that its a bad song but not really in the mood when im driving usually to hear it, other than that all these songs i love. I can definelty hear the influence of these guys on all the brit pop bands to come after them especially in The Verve and Oasis..Excelent album recomend to anyone who likes genuinely good pop rock music I don't think the version of Fool's Gold on this album is the full length version which is almost 10 minutes long. (9:53) You haven't really heard the song in it's full jam-to-the-death sonic glory until you've heard it groove out for 9:53. You can't get it on Amazon.com - go to Amazon.co.uk and import it! If you like or love Fool's Gold 4:15 and you have never heard 9:53 you are missing out! Go get it. NOW! Since The Stone Roses' debut has achieved legendary status as the seminal album of the late 80's Madchester movement, you knock it at your own peril.  After all, there is some brilliant stuff here.  The 1-2 punch of ""She Bangs the Drums"" and ""Elephant Stone"" represent some of the best pop the 80's had to offer.The problem is that the 80's is where most of that pop has stayed.  This is a record that, with the notable exception of ""Fool's Gold"", is dated.  The tinny production makes the songs sound distant, as if they're being played in the room next door.  It's exciting to hear the Stone Roses meld guitar riffs with dance textures, but none of it sounds as revolutionary as it all once was.  Leftover studio tricks from 80's stick out here like signposts.  You can occasionally spot riffs that belong on a Duran Duran record.  The drums all sound programmed and pushed well into the background.  The whole album just feels like a product of its era.This may all sound blasphemous, but consider this record compared to others from its era.  U2's ""The Joshua Tree"" still sounds fresh when you listen to it today.  The sound is immediate, as if were just recorded.  The Stone Roses suffers mightily by comparison.  It is certainly a good record, and by accounts is was a record that changed music forever in the UK.  But it is not a timeless record, and that's the title many have erroneously bestowed upon it. This music moves you and is pretty good raw Manchester underground british psychedelic rock stuff that you can trip to. I did back in 1989. I won't forget that. The best cactus peyote I ever had! Elephant Stone! The Stone Roses were one of those bands who burned brightly... and all too briefly. Thankfully their presence has been long-lasting -- the music of their self-titled first album still lingers long after the breakup of the band. They captured lightning in a bottle, even if their first album's musical perfection was their downfall.After the panoramic, rumbling buildup of ""I Wanna Be Adored,"" the Roses catch you with rollicking, infectious rock songs and psychedelic trips. While sticking to strong pop melodies and rock instrumentation, the Roses manage to experiment around a bit -- the delicate ""Waterfall"" is literally turned backwards and replayed, in a song that is almost as good as the original.The true rock rebellion shows in ""Bye Bye Bad Man"" with protests concerning French student riots (""Every backbone and heart you break/We'll still come back for more"") and an acid-tinged anti-royalist song. Finishing up the unalloyed brilliance is the bitter, complicated ""I Am the Resurrection,"" and the melodic ""Fool's Gold"" -- two of the best songs on the album.The Stone Roses spread their influence far in this album -- there are soft ballad-like melodies, whirling psychedelic trips, and rock that rises, crests and slowly sinks. Expect your heartbeat to rise and sink with it -- because this music has a richness and depth that most rock music cannot even begin to equal.John Squire's guitar riffs are flexible and fluid; it sounds like this guy was reinventing guitar licks all on his own. His shimmering guitar riffs of ""Waterfall"" are truly magnificent. The deep basslines will drawn you in whether you like it or not, as will Reni's outstanding drumming. Everything culminates in a wild, dense psychedelic mass in the overwhelming ""I Am the Resurrection.""Ian Brown's vocals are excellent; unlike many rock singers, he has genuine vocal talent. The writing for these songs is deeply vibrant. Sometimes the intensity is almost breathtaking, as Brown sings, ""I am the resurrection and I am the light/I couldn't ever bring myself/To hate you as I'd like."" Ow, heavy stuff. But he is equally good with the quieter songs, sounding sad and a little pensive.""The Stone Roses"" is an unforgettable musical experience.  A culmination of musical genius, this is one of the handful of albums out there without a bad track or a sense of monotony. Very, very highly recommended. A really beautiful, but rocking album.  The vocals and lyrics are great and the overall sound of the album as a whole has been mimiced by so many britpop bands its ridiculous.  Its a Little Before my time but It is just flat out good.  The last song is incredible.  I get in this focused intense zone everytime I hear it...This disc should be in your collection...Go buy it ...Now... really no insert!!!..., Jo, in fact too no information about the band and it's history and impact on the back cover or anywhere else..., incredible to be THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER MADE. My comfort, if correct, there are only 2000 copies over the world, I have the 1751/2000 ... This album still amazes after more than 17 years. It definitely has stand the test of time. Rarely there's an album that you'll like every track but this is the best example of a loved-all-the-tracks cd. Just can't get enough of their jangly guitar pop tunes. I just hope a deluxe remastered version will be in the works for this timeless gem. All personal enthusiasm aside, this is the only album I can honestly recommend to anyone regardless of her/his musical taste. No album could have more universal appeal IMO. Ironic considering it's relegated to mere &quot;cult&quot; status in the U.S. The Roses' style embraces the classic melodies of the variety that have allowed the Beatles to endure as the most widely loved band of the rock and roll era, while at the same time showcasing a certifiable guitar hero, undoubtably rock's greatest attraction and one the mighty Beatles actually did not have (one never confuses George Harrison with Jimmy Page). Most importantly, the Roses modernized their classic influences, taking rock out to the rave culture that was so popular on the British Isles in the late 80's. In fact, this album has made its most lasting mark from this unification of rock and dance in both rhythm (though somewhat understated) and spirit. Also gratifying is the fact that the album plays the part of the masterpiece with the full intention of being one, complete with a slow rising epic introduction in Adored, ambitious studio wizardry perhaps best exemplified in Don't Stop (Waterfall backwards), hushed theatrics found in This Is The One, the psychedelic, raved up 9 minute jamfest climax of I Am The Resurrection, and even a chilled, funked-out denoument in Fool's Gold.All in all, this album transcends personal taste. People are predisposed to enjoy humming to an irresistable melody, bobbing their heads to a catchy beat, or doing a little air guitar. Thus, everyone is predisposed to LOVE this album. It may take a couple of spins for the record's worthiness of its infinite hype to be revealed, but trust me, it will. This is the surest bet of any CD purchase you could ever make. Buy it and enjoy! This is one of those albums that you can play from beginning to end and it all flows and sounds great.  Staring with the melodic and somber I Wanna be Adored and ending with the epic Fools Gold - the listener becomes enraptured in these beautiful melodies and lyrics.You simply can't go wrong with this album.  Buy it. Any album that starts with the line ""I don't have to sell my soul, he's already in me"" certainly sparks immediate interest.  John Squire's guitar work is remarkable throughout the entire album, reaching its height on ""I am the Resurrection.""  Sure, there's arrogance here, and perhaps even some songs that slouch at points, but the overall effort is superb.  The Stone Roses prove to be a jam band for those who think Phish to be tired, and a band who've the emotion of the Smiths, but couple it with a self-confidence that Oasis would make popular in the mid-90s.  This self-titled album, and their ""The Second Coming"" are dually amazing, and need to be part of any music collection. What did &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; sound like when it was first released? Well I wasn't there so I can't really say. Some say that the Stone Roses were all hype and I think that's just wrong. Suede, now THEY'RE  all hype. Ugh. But those Roses, man, they had talent. I wish there was some  band that sounds like them now but there isn't. They mean nothing to us  Yanks weaned on grunge and boy band pop. Oh well... This album has some of  the coolest bass lines ever. Especially &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; and  &quot;She Bangs The Drums&quot;. Oh and &quot;Fools Gold&quot; that rocks  too. And the drum beat gets SOOOOO hypnotic. I mean when &quot;Fools  Gold&quot; starts you should turn the bass all the way up and then put both  your speakers on the floor and lay down. It sounds really cool. Now I've  never smoked reefer before but word on the street is that it &quot;puts you  in a trance&quot; or something. Well if you're one of those lazy drugged up  lowlifes that's constantly giving my generation a bad name then this just  might be the album for you. That rhythm section in &quot;Fools Gold&quot;,  though. Wow. Garbage and Rusted Root must worship at the sonic altar of  that song. Buy it now. Awwwww amn..... YES! YES! THIS ALBUM RULES!!!!! Every song is classic. Excellent songcraft in the beginning, middle, AND end! And friggin' HAPPY for once!! In today's depressed music world of &quot;I'm not here, this isn't happening&quot; and &quot;If I say 'F---', two more times that's twenty six 'F---s' in this f---ed up rhyme&quot;, you owe it to yourself to go out and buy something freakin' OPTIMISTIC and FEEL GOODY for once! The album REALLY improves your mood and makes you feel good! It adds happiness to an otherwise depressing day! The opener, &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; starts out really creepy and then Mani plays one of the catchiest basslines ever, a few more bars of that, then a huge snare drum hit, and they're off! &quot;I don't haaaaaaaaaaaveeeeeee ta sellllll myyyyy soulllllllllllllllllllllllll. He's alreadyyyyyyyyyy innnn meeeeeeeeeeeee.&quot; WHERE did the belief that Ian &quot;King Monkey&quot; Brown couldn't carry a tune in a bucket come from? He sounds FANTASTIC on this album! He's got such a low cool voice that doesn't really make him seem as arrogant as he's supposed to be!!! Then there's &quot;She Bangs The Drums&quot; with another catchy bassline, this one a much faster, more &quot;poppy&quot; one. Also one awesome John Squire guitar solo at the end. Probably the most anthemic song they ever did. Sure, call it &quot;stupid&quot;, call it &quot;derivative&quot;, call it whatever you want. I guarantee you'll be singing along merrily &quot;How could it ever come to pass? She'll be the first she'll be the last.&quot; over and over after you've heard it a couple times for it to sink in your head. Okay after that, you've got &quot;Elephant Stone&quot; and &quot;Waterfall&quot;, two more poppy songs, one real crashy and bangy, the other wah wahy and dreamy. Rules, as always. I used to really detest the next song &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, which is just mostly &quot;Waterfall&quot; played backwards with new lyrics, but now I think the reason they did that was because it sounded just as good backwards as it did forwards, so they turned it into a new song. Uhhh.... okay! The next one, &quot;Bye Bye Badman&quot; takes the musical feel-good spirit even further, with a great John Squire shuffle guitar solo. Yet another great song. An album with this many great songs makes you really mad that the Roses never conquered America. ...They invented Britpop! Anyway, after &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot;, you get &quot;(Song For My) Sugar Spun Sister&quot;, which just might even more of an anthem than &quot;She Bangs The Drums&quot;. Dig that &quot;Yeah yeah yeah the candy [something] girrrrllllll, The sticky-fingered boy!!!!! Oh the sister of miiinnneeee Oh yeah yeah yeah!!&quot; chorus at the end. Then there's &quot;Made Of Stone. Boy, you'd never expect a song with as ridiculously dumb a chorus as &quot;Sometimes I fantasize&quot; would be so dang CATCHY and SINGALONGABLE, but it is! &quot;Shoot You Down&quot;'s got soft Reni drums and Hawaiian guitar. And there's &quot;This Is The One&quot;, which is all Ian sings for the last minute and a half or so: &quot;OOOOOH THIS IS THE OONNNNNNNNNEEEEEE SHE'S WAITING FORRRRRRRR&quot;. This review is really boring isn't it? Then the album closes with not one, but TWO of the absolute GREATEST dance songs I've EVER heard in my life (except &quot;One Nation Under A Groove&quot; of course, but never mind that for now). In fact, did I mention how awesome the bass is in this album. If you play bass you NEED this album. Hell, even if you DON'T play bass you need this album. But bassists should really love it. If Mani doesn't qualify for rock's greatest bassist ever, I don't know who does. Okay, so &quot;Resurrection&quot; starts off like that with the snare hits and the &quot;Behind The Counter&quot; bassline, but then about three minutes into it it slows down and Mani plays this &quot;Doodoo doo doo duh doo da doo doooooooooo&quot; riff and Reni plays a couple of hi hat fills then kicks in this awesome dance beat and awww man it's so rockin' you gotta hear it. The they're off!! It turns into NOTHING but a phat jam. I mean, NOBODY plays jams like this anymore. WHY NOT???? Then there's ANOTHER awesome dance song after this one and it's like ten minutes long, called &quot;Fools Gold&quot;, with an even catchier bassline, groovier drums, and one hell of a trippyesque wah wah solo at the end. Okay so I've just described all the songs on the album. BUY IT NOW!!! It's rockin' dancy, happy, and oh so friggin' CATCHY!! And you know what? It was only their debut. OK so I'm listening to this cd for the um-teenth thousandth time and my wife says to me &quot;Either you stop playing this freakin' cd or I'm leaving&quot;. I respond with a sniffle, &quot;I'm gonna miss you!!!&quot; I wanna be adored!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Stone Roses' debut is really one of the best album of all time. Ian Brown, the charming and energetic &quot;King Monkey&quot; vocal; John Squire, one of the best guitarist in his generation with his deep blues  root; Mani, whose funky and massive baseline has always stir up every cell  of mine; and Reni, with his unique drums skills and talent. The Stone Roses  is really a true SUPER GROUP. Unlike many rock bands, their music seems  more optimistic--with lyrics like &quot;The past was yours but the future's  mine&quot;(She Bangs the Drums), &quot;I don't have to sell my soul, it's  already in me/I wanna be adored&quot;(I Wanna Be Adored). No doubt, Fools  Gold has really changed music. John Squire's excellent guitar skills with  the cry baby effect(wah-wah! ), Ian Brown's low and &quot;mysterious&quot;  vocal and the dance-beat-like drums behind. Whenever Mani's  &quot;funkiest&quot; bassline got louder...that's the greatest part of the  sound. This song is not just a rock song, it also influnenced dance music.  Is this the root of today's Drum n' Bass? Is that what we call &quot;dance  rock&quot;? Besides, other songs are very excellent, too, but there;s too  little space here for me to write...haha. My favourites are &quot;elephant  stone&quot;, &quot;she bangs the drums&quot; , &quot;bye bye badman&quot;,  &quot;made of stone&quot; and &quot;elizabeth my Dear&quot;.  &quot;Elizabeth...&quot; is really a nice song about anti-monarchy, i  expecially like the pistol-sound at the end. It's great. If you're at all curious about the Stone Roses and their refreshing brand of britpop, I say go for it. Their 1989 debut is a really worthwhile record, though I must admit it took me longer than I thought to get into it. It really conjures up a certain time and a certain place, and yet its pretty timeless. Personally, it takes me both to the grey streets of cities like Manchester and to the wide English countryside (which I always imagine, listening to this, with stray hay floating through the air).I've heard this band being called psychedelic. Though they add a couple of minor artsy touches reminiscent of psychedelia (backwards guitar in ""Don't Stop"", flanged guitar in ""Bye Bye Badman"", etc), I wouldn't really call them that. They're just catchy English rock songs, guitar, bass, drums, gentle but strong vocals from Ian Brown, and while some can be moody (like ""I Wanna Be Adored"" and the short, blunt ""Elizabeth My Dear""), most of them are delivered joyously, particularly some of the choruses. There's even a jam to finish things off at the end of ""I Am the Resurrection"")I'd recommend this record to fans of Blur, The Smiths, Suede, Oasis and the like. It's quality. The Stone Roses are monolithic flowers indeed. Looks like I'm being a bit redundant here, since the previous thirty-seven listeners have it bang to rights.  Most albums that everyone loves have at least a few detractors--or at least a few who don't think they're perfect  in every way imaginable--but for obvious reasons, The Stone Roses is an  exception.  About all you can say is, &quot;Just buy it.&quot;  It sounds  trite, and it's the sort of thing many different people say about many  different albums, but this truly is an exception.  It's just impossible to  quantify the virtues of this album.  Since coherent sentence structure is  simply incapable of summing up this album, I will instead say  this:joyfullyecstasyhappinesseuphoriablisssunshinewonderelectricityloveunimaginableOnce  you hear it, you will understand. 9am on a sunday morning in the early nineties. You get back to London after an intense 3 hour drive back from a free party in an anonymous field in Somerset. 36 hours on the go - time to chill out, take things down a notch or two. everyone flops down, tries to crash. then someone puts the stone roses album on the decks. you try to fight it, settle further into the sofa. Then the music takes hold. Looking around, people are stirring. I wanna... i wanna... i wanna be adored. Whooshbangboom. You're off again. Just one of those collections that is a must. Right up there with a copy of a &quot;Love will tear us apart&quot; cut or something along those line. Buy it. I missed this one's significance at the time of it's release, even though I owned it for a while without really listening to it.  Most of us have been guilty of it at one point or another, and I've got my share of skeletons.By the time the Roses got around to recording their sporadically brilliant sophomore album (4 years too late), their time had passed, but not before they released their debut; it's the pinnacle of the Brit-Pop, Manchester scene in the year '89, and with good reason.  It's a solid pop album.The album starts off strong with both ""I Wanna Be Adored"", and ""She Bangs The Drums"", continues mid-way with ""Made of Stone"", ""Sugar Spun Sister"", then peaks with ""I Am The Resurrection"" (some editions fail to contain ""Fool's Gold"" for some reason).  Maybe it's not the 'essential' britpop album, but you could do much, much worse. i loved this album so much i had to buy it twice...well, only to replace my worn down cassette...nobody who considers themselves a fan of modern music should be without this album, i'm just saddened that i wasn't able to see them when they came to TO back in '95, even given the hostile atmosphere the boys were creating at that time...if you don't have this album, shame! I don't have to sell my soul, he's already in me. The devil has all the best tunes - Ian Brown knew that and the boy gods that were the Stone Roses knew people would start asking questions once they'd heard the glorious debut album. Surely nobody could create this wonderful noise without a little help from his satanic majesty.This album stuns me. I must have listened to it a thousand times in the space of twelve years. It has grown familiar but will never breed contempt. Quite simply it is the finest collection of songs known to man or beast. It it is the greatest testament to the fact that music can be the the most powerful affirmation of what it is to be human, to feel, to live. Even now this record still has the power to knock me out of my miserable set of preconceptions, to kick me up the backside and tell me to get on with living, instead of simply moaning about how shitty life can be.Three virtuoso musicians, one flawed but irresistibly charismatic singer. A song writing partnership that married technical brilliance, naive simplicity and a self belief so strong it almost conquered the world. What the Stone Roses possessed in spades was synergy, alchemy, magic - something so much more than the sum of their parts. The inexplicable electricity you feel as the bass line to I Wanna Be Adored thumps straight through you, as the liquid crystal guitar trickles into your brain, as the drums seem to rise up through your feet from the earth's core, and then that immortal first line, the crushingly insouciant delivery, almost whispered. You think it can't get better, and actually you're just about right - but it comes damn close. The opening guitar salvo of She Bangs the Drums screams at you to celebrate life - capturing the infectious sense of euphoria that you last felt when you were a kid, the sheer joy of waking up on a summer's day and running around in circles like a madman. Listening to Waterfall, I think of the first line of Tomorrow Never Knows - turn off your mind relax and float downstream. It's as though they've managed to distil all the best harmonies, stolen from the Beach Boys, the Beatles and the Byrds, and made something infinitely more lovely - it positively lulls you. Sugar Spun Sister has the best chorus of any song ever, dripping sunshine and rainbows, honey and love. Made of Stone is an amphetamine surge, a call to arms exuding a sense of urgency and menace.  And with a killer guitar solo. This is the One means what it says - it captures that headrush when you're absolutely certain about someone, and everything is beautiful. And to the end. I am the Resurrection and I am the life. Close your eyes and you'll think you're flying. In 1989, armed with 11 songs and some Jackson Pollock-style artwork, The Stone Roses seized immortality and then some. What had gone before was shrouded in mystery, until the excellent biogs by John Robb and Mick  Middles, and the release of Garage Flowers, revealed the lost first album.  Until then, all we had were the Byrds-like promise of Sally Cinnamon, and  the brilliant Elephant Stone.That The Stone Roses had been hanging  around since the mid-eighties and had recorded a dodgy goth-rock album as  early as 1985 may explain how their debut album proper couldn't possibly be  the first attempt of four young upstarts to singlehandedly hijack the  British music scene: it was too impossibly perfect (eleven years later it  still tops many of the Best Album Of All Time polls).As the Martin  Hannett inspired intro to I Wanna Be Adored rumbles into focus, like the  sound of a storm in heaven, &quot;the most infectious bassline ever&quot;  (copyright) takes over, and seizes control of you. By the time Ian Brown  whispers the immortal line &quot;I don't have to sell my soul - he's  already in me&quot;, you know this song has the ability to reduce you to  jelly - if Mani and Reni don't get you first, Squire will nail you with the  best sound to have been produced by a guitar since Hendrix cut a mountain  down with the edge of his hand. She Bangs the Drums opens the floodgates -  pure, unadulterated pop perfection - all delicious guitar trickery and  soaring harmonies - like water to a dying man. Waterfall, the tale of a  girl on acid, is another absolute gem, a chiming riff, a killer melody -  kind of like Simon and Garfunkel put through a blender. Don't Stop is  Waterfall pulled backwards through a hedge, Elizabeth My Dear is  Scarborough Fair assassinating the Queen (we'll skip Bye Bye Badman, if you  don't mind), and then there's Sugar Spun Sister, containing possibly the  most perfect (yes, I realise that's the third time I've used it) chorus in  the history of modern music - I defy you not to feel uplifted/euphoric/  ecstatic when you listen to it. Then there's Made of Stone, The Rolling  Stones' Paint it Black given the Squire/Brown makeover - another  superlative bassline, more guitar wizardry from John Squire, Ian Brown in  glorious form. Shoot You Down is a lovely, if vicious, ode to unwanted love  - &quot;I never wanted the love that you showed me, it's starting to choke  me&quot;.  That brings us to the best thirteen minutes to close an album I  can think of.  This Is the One is utterly gorgeous, as close to a love song  as Ian Brown gets on this album, and anyone who considers him the weak link  in The Stone Roses should think again.  Then of course there's I Am the  Resurrection, surely the greatest single blast of pop/rock/psychedelia to  have graced these shores in many a decade.  The workout at the end is  legendary.What came after was Fools Gold, and the words to describe that  fail me.The Stone Roses. Genius. Shove this one into the hands of anyone who dare says the music of the 80's was all Flock of Seagulls.A bunch of shaggy haired boys in Manchester managed to rewrite the rules on Brit-Pop and pave the way for the coke snorting Oasises of now.It opens sinsterly enough- there's something nearly Satanic about &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot;, with its coiling, sexy guitar hooks and sultry command for well-earned adulation.The darkness quickly gives way to lighter fare though- She Bangs the Drums, Sugar Spun Sister, and This is the One seem joyous to the point of revelry, meshing pysch, dance, and utter-pop wonder into a crystaline finished product.It almost seems to good to be true at times.  The music is so sharp and catchy, that one could easily see it falling into the hands of a producer with visions of the Backstreet Boys dancing in his brain, but there's none of that over-worked schmaltz here.The Stone Roses is polished with rough edges and so enjoyable, so effortless in it's grace, it seems like impossible that an album could carry this much street cred and still make you smile and sing along.Perfect. Being a huge fan of British music, I had heard of the Stone Roses but had never heard any of their music so I decided to pick up this album when I saw it the other day and...WOW, this is one of the greatest albums of all time, their are so many great songs from I Wanna Be Adored to Waterfall to Made of Stone to Fools Gold.  Its really trippy, dancable, British rock music.  It never lags one bit...I Am The Resurrection is the best song in my opinion.  Go get this now, you won't be disappointed. I bought this album 11 years ago and it still finds it's way into steady rotation on my cd player. I hate most of the stuff that comes out of the UK, but these guys were unique. They wrote the most beautiful melodies, heaped on soaring choruses and the interplay between musicians was outstanding. They played the most uplifting happy music but never sounded sappy. It wasn't embarrassing to say you dug these guys. Everyone I know who has heard this album has LOVED it. Somehow, they managed to squeeze 30 years of pop music into one majestic piece of work. From the distant clicking train tracks that introduce ""I Wanna Be Adored"" to the final tambourine shake at the end of ""Fool's Gold"", the Stone Roses' debut inspires awe and adoration. I'm running out of superlatives here. It's as if they took every good element of indie-pop, folk-rock, funk, house and psychedelia and somehow made it click. ""She Bangs The Drums"" is pure grandeur. Not one hook or melody is wasted. ""Waterfall"" takes it's cue from a propelling shuffle beat and a pulsing bass line that raise the shimmering guitars to heights way beyond your standard UK jangle guitar bands. R.E.M. only wish their guitars could chime like this. ""This Is The One"" is a the most uplifting cynical song ever and ""Shoot You Down""'s soft brush drumming and gentle arpeggios create a magnificent ambience. ""I Am The Ressurection"" sees the band start off in a Merseybeat pop style only to morph into a monstrous psychedelic jam that includes 12-string and countrified slide guitar, maracas, tambourines, bongos, funk-derived basslines and frenetic drum soloing. It's as if all the 60's had been compressed into one eight-minute power pop jam. In truth, there is not one bum track on the whole album. John Squire's guitar playing is the unholy bastard child of Hendrix, Page, Johnny Marr, Paul Simon and Roger McGuinn. Reni is the best drummer to come out of Britain in a generation. Not since John Bonham and Keith Moon had their been a limey drummer with such a distinctive style. Mani's bass playing is functional, but, because he's surrounded by virtuosos, somebody has to keep it simple. Ian Brown was tone-deaf live, so his vocals must have been run through heavy harmonizers and sequencers because he sounds good here. At their peak the Roses could do no wrong. Their b-sides could have easily been saved up and used as a second album, and it would have still been better than most bands' best outputs. Oasis copped their attitude, the Verve borrowed their jam-heavy stylings, Blur took the art-school feyness and Radiohead even nicked their producer. The Roses have to be the most influential and inspirational cult band in the world. Unfortunately, they frittered away all their potential by delaying their second album, losing Reni's powerful drumming, by abandoning the sound that made people love them and by playing awful live shows. Their aloofness turned into laziness and killed the band. At least they can be proud of this one gem they bestowed upon the music world. I was lucky to come across something this sublime at the moment it was unleashed upon the world. God Bless.

I was lucky to come across something this sublime at the moment it was unleashed upon the world.  God Bless. and i know it was released in 1989. Mike and the Mechanics ushering in the Madchester scene? You must subscribe to Roling Stone magazine, 'lad'. ""The Living Years"" was just soft adult fake prog pablum created (or should I say, manufactured) by a bunch of aging second string hipsters with greying ponytails who couldn't usher in their own garbage tin from the street much less a new pop scene. In addition, they weren't even from Manchester, where you had to be from, to usher in the MADchester scene. Get it? The Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses were the real proginators of the Madchester scene.Now, after all that, is the 'Stone Roses' perfect? Absolutely not. At the time it was touted as the best debut ever, alongside the Beatles, which it kind of seemed like at the time if you were 16-18 yr old kid with a good weekly pot allowance. It is still a great guitar album, and still holds up for the most part, but it has gone from 5 stars down to 4 due to some sub par filler which wasn't filler to me when I was that 18 year old kid with a sizable pot allowance! Bottom line, it is a great album by a great band whose flame burned out quicker than their ambitions and a wonderful and important part of late 80's early 90's pop music scene.Cheers ""Lad"" The best Stone Roses release, and one of the best albums I've heard. The Stone Roses put a full stop to the grey wash that hung over the late 1980s British music scene after the departure of The Smiths, bringing melodies, harmonies, and (sometimes) funky beats together in a fusion that hangs incredibly well together on this album. From the simmering opening to the final funky beat of 'Fool's Gold' 'The Stone Roses' is a tour de force, with echoes of Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Rolling Stones, and even Sly and the Family Stone. No bad tracks, but highlights are the opening track, 'I Wanna Be Adored', 'Waterfall', 'Made of Stone' and the clever 'Don't Stop', which is 'Waterfall' backwards with some lyrics and instrumentation added.Oasis, The Verve, The Charlatans, and more recently Kasabian are some of the bands most overtly influenced by the Roses, but none of them have ever done anything this good in my opinion.Everyone I've played this to has loved it. It's an exhilerating first listen (yep, I remember), and still great 16 years on. Buy this twice before you even think about their dismally disappointing second album 'Second Coming'. If you love the Stone Roses, it is worth it.  If you have never heard the Stone Roses, at least give it a try.  You don't have to get the 20th anniversary edition.  If you love music and you don't at least like this album, there may be something wrong with you. This is the most magical album of the last twenty years. Most albums now cannot hold their consistency throughout, while the Stone Roses kills the whole way through. The leadoff track, I Want To Be Adored, sets the tone for one of the most laid back and beautiful things put to record. Songs such as Waterfall and She Bangs the Drums bring a tear to my eye and make me yearn for younger summer days. There even is some mild funk to close off the masterpiece with Fools Gold, which even at nearly 10 minutes does not drag. All I can say is I was blown away by this work, and it singlehandedly reaffirmed my love of music. I bought this album when it came out in 1989 on an import cassette and then on an import CD so it didn't include &quot;fools gold&quot;. To say this is the best debut album of all time is an understatement. I still  listen and marvel at its brilliance over 10 years later. Definitely going  into the &quot;10 albums i need on a deserted island&quot; along with  Hatful of Hollow, Technique, OK Computer and several others. the stone roses is the third greatest album i have ever heard (behind dylans blonde on blonde, and the whos tommy), yet for a long time it was my favourite. the elegance in the songs is emphasised by ian brown pisspoor  voice and squires guitar contains no limits. the jingle jangle morning  sound is imitated by the roses, but has been equally imitated by just about  every band since at some stage in their career (charlatans, blur, verve,  embrace, oasis(although poorly)). without the stone roses britian would  have been overtaken by nirvana imitators and one note dance songs, but they  kept a subtle simplicity to the songs. their official follow up (second  coming) is equally excellent in different ways and will become just as  revered in the future. once split squires seahorses continued in a similiar  vain (listen to his allovertheshow guita on do it yourself) and brown  released two of the best albums of the late nighties, and made some simple  marching dance the coolest thing of the age. This album is brilliant I wish they come and play some dates in the USThis is a great album from start tot finish! It truly does get better with each listen.  Simply put, one of the greatest albums ever recorded. I first listened to this album when it came out, in 1989. 12 years later, it has withstood the test of time -- I still listen to it, I still count it among one of my favorites, I still fervently recommend it. Words don't do it justice -- magnificent, epic, monumental, transforming...just plain perfect. I hope...no, I expect that, 12 years from now, I will still be listening to this, and introducing my kids to the band that never quite got off the ground. The opening track &quot;I want to be adored&quot; hooks me every time.  This is one of the rarest of musical finds, like the Beatles Revolver, and Still Feel Gone by Uncle Tupelo it will forever find regular rotation on my stereo.  There are few albums which can be listened to tirelessly, this is one. Never has a band captured my emotions and innermost feelings as the Roses have!!!  It was a dark day in my life when I heard they had broke up.  This CD, is in my opinion a select work of art that is worth far more than the  material that is was printed on.  Roses Live On!!!! I'm a confessed CD-a-holic.  Even when I've run out of CD's to purchase, I'll take a risk and buy a CD of a band I've never heard before.  Silly?  Maybe.  But when it leads to purchases as brilliant as this, I don't really care anymore.The Stone Roses could have been the biggest band in the world, but somewhere along the line, something went terribly wrong.  They only released two albums in their career, and a handful of non-album singles.  This was their debut, and what a debut it was.From the opening chords of &quot;I wanna be adored&quot; to the endless guitar jam at the end of &quot;I am the resurrection&quot;, this is music to lose yourself in.  The fact that this album was released in the 80's (the decade of one-hit wonders) elevates this album to legendary status.Only the Roses can make a pop gem (&quot;Waterfall&quot;) and the same song backwards (&quot;Don't stop&quot;) sound like totally different songs.  It was only recently when I discovered that not only is the music backwards, but the lyrics as well!  Any band that can make a backwards song sound as good as this is well worth investigating.Many say the Roses resurrected guitar pop.  I find it hard to disagree with this sentiment.  Every song on this album is a pop gem.  Take the risk like I did.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Let me put my very life on the line and be one of the few to pose my confusion at the generally high (sometimes top, as in Observer Music Monthy's latest top 100 list) ranking of this record. It should be said first that the Brits consider this their all-time best, without Fool's Gold on it (an American release inclusion). I love that track, as well as I Wanna Be Adored, but everything in between sounds rather mediocre to my ears, and I consider myself a pretty serious music lover. when I back up and listen to it in its entirety, I just cannot put it up against any of the other nine records on OMM's list. Even Metal Box (number 10) with it's stunning fidelity tops the comparatively muddied recording of this debut. Time will put it in its place eventually, but that's not to slam it. It just doesn't stand out to my ears. I mean, Bye Bye Bad Man doesn't stand up to anything on, say, Astral Weeks (rated number 4 on the list). I'd put Tomorrow Never Knows, that singular track from the second place record against the entire Stone Roses' record. Back to the days of baggy pants and a lay back feel for the funky jamma. This album captures a generation and a century. Truly a classic throughout. ""this is the one"". I grew up with this album in the heady days of the BritPop invasion. It's intertwined with my memories and always will be. Regardless of my sentimental attachment, this album is brilliant, and I've returned to it over and over again through the years, even as I have become an old geezer. Musically organic, totally stretched out, driving bass and drums, inspired guitar work; there won't be another one like this ever, no matter how many have tried to imitate it over the years. Remember how Shaun of the Dead wanted to verify that it was not this, the FIRST Stone Roses album, which was to be thrown at the zombies? Yes there is a reason he wanted to check. Even if you are threatened with flesh eating ghouls, this one is a keeper. My own highest recommendation. Every band/artist releases an album that's a game-changer. Either it's the band's magnum opus or a watershed moment that changes the music industry forever. In rare cases, the album fits in both categories. THE STONE ROSES is one of those albums.Like many great British alternative rock albums, THE STONE ROSES doesn't get much love in the United States, for a variety of reasons, some sensible, some illogical. One illogical reason is the Stone Roses sounded ""too British"". But then that's like saying that John Lennon's music didn't work because he didn't sound like Bob Seger. A more sensible reason is that the Stone Roses were part of the now-forgotten Madchester scene, which was a movement where British rock bands fused acid-house dance rhythms and melodic pop, filled with catchy choruses, psychedelic flourishes and chugging beats. They owed as much to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Kinks as Funkadelic, Sonic Youth and the Jesus and Mary Chain. That movement became obsolete for two reasons: 1.) Bands like the Stone Roses fell prey to drug abuse that hindered their music; and 2.) Nirvana's NEVERMIND was released in 1991 and grunge became the forefront in 1990's popular music. It also didn't help that the Stone Roses didn't follow up their debut until 1996, with the critically maligned SECOND COMING.But to say that is to make unfair generalizations. NEVERMIND and THE STONE ROSES were amazing albums; it's just that THE STONE ROSES was more of a victim of bad timing, the changing music climate and American rock fans' prejudice towards anything British. But time has a way of healing wounds and now THE STONE ROSES deserves its rightful place as one of the greatest and most influential alternative rock albums of all time.What makes THE STONE ROSES unique? Well, let's talk about the band: The Stone Roses were a traditional guitar-pop band that happened to love dance beats. Ian Brown had a detached singing that recalled Morrissey; John Squire was a skillful guitarist that created psychedelic guitar hooks and simple, layered melodies; and Reni and Mani represented the unique rhythm section that helped make their songs less heavy and more groovy. They were a band that treated pop, rock and dance as if they were one, rather than three, entities. In short, they made rock music that you could also dance to.THE STONE ROSES, their debut album, crystallizes that attitude perfectly. Each song unfolds one by one, creating a colorful, neo-psychedelic world that sounds retro but feels modern. ""I Wanna Be Adored"" builds on a pulsating bass-line, cool guitar hooks and before Reni's slamming percussion and Brown's crooning vocals come in to play; ""Waterfall"" is a relaxing ballad that sounds every bit as aquatic as a waterfall; ""Bye Bye Birdman"" is a lovely fusion of psychedelic pop and rolling beats; ""This is the One"" is the kind of song you would play at a celebration party; and ""I Am the Resurrection"" is an epic as heavy as Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"". Even the filler tracks intrigue: ""Don't Stop"" is basically ""Waterfall"" played in reverse.But the album's best song is ""Made of Stone"". With its opening gel-like guitar riff and a chuggy bass and fast-paced percussion that provides the beat and the rock while Ian Brown croons about fantasizing when the streets are cold and lonely, ""Made of Stone"" is the epitome of the band's trademark sound and the Madchester movement. Released as the album's first single, it should've been a huge hit in the UK and at least made a dent at the Billboard charts. Thankfully, the second single, the rollicking ""She Bangs the Drums"", was more successful.THE STONE ROSES, along with The Smiths' QUEEN IS DEAD, was cited as a major influence on a generation of 90's British rock bands like Oasis, Blur and Pulp. Indeed, it's hard to imagine Pulp's ""Common People"", Oasis' ""Supersonic"" and Blur's ""Girls and Boys"" without ""Elephant Stone"", ""This is the One"" and ""Made of Stone"". But it also should be praised because it is a fantastic record in its own right: diverse, exciting and rewarding on multiple listens. Even if NME failed to recognize the album, it would still be considered a classic today. It's tempting to avoid listening to the album given the reasons that I explained. But trust me, buy this album and you won't regret the purchase. Get it while you still can.BONUS:As a bonus, there are a couple of versions of THE STONE ROSES: the original UK version and the US version that contains the fantastic ""Elephant Stone"". Then another US version that does not include ""Elephant Stone"" but ""Fool's Gold"", the band's most popular track. In addition, there's a 20th anniversary deluxe set that contains 2 CDs and 1 DVD of the album. But either version is a worthwhile purchase to anyone whose new to the band and those anyone who has followed the band since its formation in the late 1980's. This is the one.  This is the music that defined my world in 1989.  This was the sound that made me finally believe in the power of music.  All drama aside.  My dad had his favorite album that he never got sick of playing nor sick of talking about.  I grew up in a house filled with music.  The good kind that radio rarely touches.  I never found that one album that captured all of the things I loved about music.  That is until a day in 1989 when I stumbled upon a sound that turned me on my ear.  It was the simple bassline and chugging beat of ""She bangs the Drums"" tinged with john Squire's magic fingering.  I knew immediatley that this was a band that was going to stay with me for a very long time.  To this day I can always put on the ""Roses"" and it's like I am forever transported to that day in a little record store in tulsa, Oklahoma.  The album is simply perfect.  Nothing has affected / effected me since...the closest being the Flaming Lips ""The Soft Bulletin"".  So, take this as you will, we all have or favorite things in the world.  This happens to be one of mine. This is a fantastic album, but you can read the other reviews to find out why.My problem is the album needs to be remasterd. If you listen to ""Very Best of the Stone Roses"" (which is remastered and recommended as an introduction to the Stone Roses) the difference is night and day and difficult to listen to the original albums songs that overlap (which is quite a number). I would also suggest adding some bonus tracks such as the Peter Hook (of New Order) produced version of ""Elephant Stone"" which makes an already great song even better (available on Very Best) and some era B-Sides especially ""Mersey Paradise"" the best Stone Roses song not on this album (and good enough alone to warrant a purchase of Turns Into Stone). A band that was here and gone well before their time.  Fantastic experimentation with effects and such, along with really good vocals/lyrics/harmonies. This one needs to be in your collection! Unfortunately, the Stone Roses did not last very long but their debut album is a major landmark in music. Alternative music, or at least that label, began with this album. It played a major role in the whole  Manchester scene, right about the time that raving became everyone's party  of choice. &quot;I wanna be adored&quot; was the only single that received  any airplay in America, but there are several songs that are just as good.  This album should not be listened to track by track but is best when played  in its entirety. Good God I cannot explain how much this album means to me from the time I bought it when I was 14 to where I am now it never grows old rather just coils and fits like a piece of sunken sunshine. Seriously though this album  will open up a whole new world for you not just musically but just how one  can look at the world. Liquid 12-string guitar runs, funky bass lines,  drums that sound off from a distance and vocals that hypnotize. The band  appeals to both men and women, it doesn't matter who you are this piece of  art sticks with you forever. If anything, The Stone Roses sound fantastic on this album. Their music is sheer quality, and im not using that as a cliche. It is. From the start, you are treated to ""I wanna be adored"", which is probably one of the best openings to an album ever. Throughout the album, you are aurally soothed by Brown's vocals, Squire's wiry riffs, Mani's effective bass and Reni's Orgasmic drum beats. This album is the rawest Brit-Rock album on the shelves, so get it! maybe this album was the most influential album of the 90's decade, and maybe the first real alternative rock album, this album takes the best of all times music and mixed in a few fantastic songs...from the Past of Beatles to The Smiths, From the future of The Pixies to Radiohead...BYE BYE BADMAN Raw and churning and aggressive, (the) Pixies' ""Doolittle"" emerged on this side of the Atlantic as yet another ancestral focal point for the grunge movement in 1989. Subversively poppy, hook-laden, and with big stinky grooves, The Stone Roses' eponymous full-length debut that same year in Great Britain emerged as the spear-carrier of the Madchester scene, combining psychedelically-tinged rock with heavily danceable rhythms. Both CD's received a significant amount of airplay on truly alternative radio stations (before ""alternative"" came to mean corporately- sponsored modern rock programmed by super computers). Both CD's are considered to be masterpieces of post-punk pop, yet The Stone Roses benefited from a stateside release in 1990 that allowed them to shift many more units just as ""Doolittle"" was playing out, suddenly embraced by newly-emerging modern-rock stations and seen as heralds of The Next Big Thing.I can't really qualitatively compare ""Doolittle"" with ""The Stone Roses""; they represent two different sub-genres of music. But I think I can qualitatively compare ""The Stone Roses"" with the rest of the Madchester scene, and based on what I heard then and continue to hear to this day I can tell you that out of all of the music released from that era, this one is the most enduring. If you're just coming to The Stone Roses, know this; the band knew how to sell a groove. So heavily integrated together that they might well have been linked through telepathy, drummer Reni and bassist Mani consistently created supple, heavy, complex interlocking rhythms that set the band apart from the rest of the Madchester pack, allowing texturally-driven guitarist John Squire to overlay his muscular, sinuous, arpeggiated, and, at times, aggressively funky riffing over a heavy spine that nevertheless bent into all sorts of elastic positions.Some of the tracks have an almost anthemic feel, building immediately toward crescendo or sustained explosive release (""Don't Stop"" and  ""This Is The One"")while others reach that plateau in a more gradual build-up of dynamic tension ( ""I Wanna Be Adored"",""Made Of Stone"", ""Waterfall"" ,  ""I Am The Resurrection"") while others simmer heavily or percolate (""Fool's Gold"", ""Elephant Stone""  and ""Shoot You Down""). No track seem to have more of a ubiquitous presence on modern rock airwaves in `90 than ""Fool's Gold"", which seemed to be a universal feature on every playlist. Several other cuts also received quite a bit of exposure; ""I Wanna Be Adored"", ""She Bangs The Drums"",  ""Elephant Stone"", ""Waterfall"", and ""Shoot You Down"" all retain presence as classics today as a result.And I'm not really an audiophile, so while this review is appearing under the re-mastered version, its primary purpose is informative w/r/t/ the relative strength of the content, rather than whether or not the sound has been definitively improved (or not), and this was (and remains) a muscular release.  I  strongly recommend buying it. I bought the stones roses second album ""Second Coming"" before I got their debut.  I had read all the hype about how it was the greatest album of all time by some pious music journalists and even a few amazon shoppers, but I had to listen to give my two cents.  I thought this album would rock more but its quite mellow and the guitars remind me of shoegaze acts like my bloody valentine and the jangle of Johnny Marr.  The vocals are quite hushed but each song flows into each other quite perfectly. This is an ablum that gets better with repeated listens but it just doesn't rock enough in my opinion. As the owner of over 3,000 CD's I think I qualify as someone who can comment on ""earth shattering"", ""greatest album on earth"" claims and this is not it.  Whilst it is a good album, perhaps great (hence the 4 stars) it is not as good as the 100+ reviews I've read suggests it is.  Perhaps it's the fact that it was an excellent debut album or the fact that not much else followed from the SR's, although Second Coming is not bad, that clouds peoples perceptions of this album.  It certainly is a quality album throughout with little or no filler, although I think the 8+ & 9+ minute ""Resurrection"" & ""Fool's Gold"" are more an example of 70's and 80's overextended ""wig outs"" than brilliant crossover dance tracks, as some have suggested.  Once again, I don't want to put a downer on things here, and whilst I agree that this was certainly the forerunner of most Britpop that followed, it is not the ""era defining"" or ""best ever"" album that most reviewers are suggesting.  I won't start a pointless arguement here by listing albums which I think are better but believe me there are many.Nonetheless any serious CD collection would be incomplete without this.Enjoy!!!! I remember sitting on the floor of my friends San Diego apartment in 1989. It must have been around 80 degrees outside and the golden California sunlight was filtering through the blinds.  The stereo was on at a  reasonable volume and my friends were getting their gear ready for the  beach in the bedrooms down the hall.  A bassline from the speakers suddenly  caught my attention, followed by a guitar riff with a vaguely Japanese  motif that was nothing like I had ever heard before.  The song was I Wanna  Be Adored and it remains to this day the only song to which I can recall  the exact moment of first listen.  This is my favorite collection of songs  and not a month goes by in which I do not let it invade, soothe and  energize my mind.  This is also my most hated album because it sets such a  high standard for pop music that few, if any, have approached. I cannot  think of another record  (and I'm talking about the record as a whole, not  individual songs) that has had the ability to conjure such disparate  emotions, from disappointment to optimism, longing for something more to  total satisfaction. It is a first love and an old familiar companion.  It  is a jealous partner not wanting you to love anyone but them as well as the  most generous open-minded lover of your dreams. I think you know what I  mean.  Oh yeah, and it is only an album. If you love this album it is well worth the purchase...the sound is much improved...and the DVD of the live show is top notch. I first heard of the Stone Roses in 1992.  My roomate had a Stone Roses CD and I put it in and played one song one time and then pulled it out.  I just did not give it a chance.  When he moved out in 1995 he left the CD, but I never bothered to play it and pretty much forgot about it.  The next time I stumbled across the Stone Roses was on this site.  The reviews sounded to good to be true.  So on the way home from work I bought this CD figuring the Stone Roses CD my roomate left me must have been their not so good second album.  Only when I got home did I realize that it was the same one.  This time I gave it a chance and I'm glad I did.  I have over 100 CD's in my collection and it seems like out of all of my choices, I keep picking this one to listen to.  I can't believe I have had this CD for so long and ignored such a great piece of work.  Now have have two of them. Surely the greatest debut album of all time.  As others have commented, every track is a classic.  13 years on and I still listen to this album more than any other I own.  If anyone doubts its continuing importance, then they should have been with me in a club in Brixton, London last week when the DJ put on &quot;I Am The Resurrection&quot;.  I will never forget looking around the dancefloor and seeing so many kids in their late 20's and early 30's with the most incredible expressions of joy, some punching the air, some in a trance and some in tears!  For those brief few minutes we were taken back to that time when we thought we, and the Roses, ruled the world.  The Stone Roses still do. If there was a blueprint on how to make an album from the first track to the last, all perfect, this is how it would sound. There is not one bad song here. I had a steady boyfriend in high school whom I had not seen for 10 years and I met up with him just recently.  You know what he told me?  More than anything, this album reminded him of me.  After we broke up he bought this album because I used to play it all the time. For him it became a cult classic...a relic of a certain age that has now passed.  This album is the epitomy of the 80's...the last true New Wave stuff.  I still have the original cassette that I used to play so much and it is so worn out that the songs last for 4 seconds before he winds up sounding like a chimpmunk.  I bought &quot;The best of the Stone Roses&quot; CD as a replacement and, boy, was that a mistake.  No need for that.  This CD is all I need, thank you very much.  No truer classic than this CD. Even if you blinked during the 80's and never knew that this band even existed this CD will transport you to the waning years of when music was actually fun to listen to. Yes, this album is quite possibly the greatest one ever made. While it may not be as groundshaking as the Beatles releases, it comes pretty damn close. All the songs are wonderfully well done and will stay in your mind  until you die, or go crazy or something. The CD is amazing and is one of  the best ones in all my collection. Sadly, they could never top this CD,  but then again, who could? Go get because you'll never regret it (unless  you're a dirty Korn fan. Then stay away from it). Enjoy! The Stone Roses were the greatest band from the Madchester era. If you are into indie rock at all, this album is definitely a must have! Unlike many of the reviewers here, this album has no memories attached to it for me. I never heard the band's work while they existed (give me a break! I'm only 17 years old!) and it's not like alternative radio's slamming this out on a daily basis (although in a just world, this would be in heavy rotation right along Pearl Jam). So when I say this is a five-star record, believe me - this is somebody who's hearing the music fresh.What makes this so addictive is the way that pop songwriting and dance grooves exist side by side. Don't get me wrong - it's not a dance album. But the Stone Roses manage to combine the two to the point where the music defies categorization, and it's beautiful. Nothing on the album is weak, and the highlights (in my opinion, &quot;Elephant Stone&quot;, &quot;Fools Gold&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Badman&quot;) are all-time classics. This may take a few listens to get, but it's well worth. Essential. While by no means catastrophic, this album has been greatly over-rated since the start. One the one hand, their greatest song, which was from that era, Fool's Gold, is not from the original version of the album and has been only added on later versions. That song was and is fantastic and does correspond to exactly what the hype was about: the perfect fusion of dance with rock estaetics. However the rest of the album is not that great. While one can see that they are talented, the sound is musddy and the playing is sloppy. While these characteristics are what makes a hypnotic song like Fool's Gold great, the remainder of the songs which are more straightforward in structure do suffer. The next record was actually somewhat better since production values were superior but since the band had been so much over-hyped, survival was not posssible and they split. Also a group such as the Happy Mondays were abloe at their best to convey much more energy in their songs. Don't get me wrong I'm an Ex-pat that lives in the States, I love the country, but the recording industry here has me scratching my head sometimes.  There is a definitive belief in my mind that the industry here is very closed minded, or perhaps just biased.  It's only really Radiohead and Coldplay that has made it in recent times.  The dullest, most boring bands I have ever heard.  Sure they each had a couple of good tunes, but come on!!  Oasis had some success, but they were not even a quarter of the band The Stone Roses were.  For those of you out there who say I'm just another Brit who reads the NME or just thinks Brit bands are better, I say to you its not the case I'm making. I think the UK is open to all American Music, but it just doesn't work the other way around and it could.  I've played close friends here Shed Seven, Dodgy, and Kula Shaker, the Roses, and even The Happy Mondays.  Many have stated that he could not believe these bands had never made it in the States, and that they made excellent records.  Whatever your point of view. I can confidently state that this album is one of the best of all time. but this album is so perfect it's scary. makes u dream of the potential. has everything on it, from the psychedelia of waterfall 2 the guitar jam of i am the resurrection. full of attitude, yet softened with the warmth of  the music and the various stylings of john squire. and it ends with a  10-minute acid house track, fool's gold. good god!  2 much enjoyment 4 2  ears. Fortunately, I found this by surfing through the Amazon website.  I read some of the reviews, heard the samples, looked over some critical reviews, and bought it.  What a find!  Up to four weeks ago I had never heard of this group, let alone the album.  Having listened to it five or six times I am convinced that there is no weak song here.  The music is melodic, inventive, fun, complex, and diverse.  With so magnificent a start, one wonders what mountains the group would have climbed had they remained together.  This may be the best first album ever.  The group is wholly self-assured and rightly so - their craftsmanship leads nothing to be desired.  One of the few albums I wish were longer.  You will not regret purchasing this work of genius. One of my all time favourite albums. Every song is good and it puts you in a great mood. Ian Brown's voice is heavenly beautiful and the music is the best. The production value is also top notch. It's one of my all time favourite albums with great music on it that everyone will enjoy. Hearing this album will put a smile on your face and make you happy and experience an album that you've never experienced before. What Can I Say. This album puts you in a good mood.The Stone Roses selftitled Album is one of the best album i've ever purchased in my entire life. It is definately a 5 star album. Every song is flawless. The production is amazing. The music and the lyric are brilliant and the performance is a top notch.You cant imagine after you have listened to it that it was recorded in just a few days with very limited budget because it is so well put together and produced.This is a must buy for every music lover out there and if you don't have this album in your record collection you must buy it now because you won't regret it. The Stone Roses made an ultimate classic album that they should be proud of. Even if they never followed it with another great album. Someone said it earlier and it is completely true - this album gets better and better after every listen.  It is a truly rewarding experience to listen to this album, whether it is your first time or your hundredth (which I am approaching).  As others have mentioned, this was the album that paved the way for Oasis, the Verve, Pulp (to a degree), Radiohead (also to a degree), Blur, and many other of the so-called ""Brit Pop"" bands.""I Wanna Be Adored"" may be the greatest opening track ever and then there is the sheer brilliance of ""Waterfall"" running into ""Don't Stop"" (they play a part of ""Waterfall"" backwards).  Ian Brown, John Squire, Reni, and Mani came together one day and for that moment, they laid down some music that was never going to be equalled, no matter how hard they tried.  ""Second Coming"" (which was a belated 5 year follow-up) is solid but no where near the album that ""The Stone Roses"" is.  But how could it have been?  ""The Stone Roses"" was an album to perfection.Everyone who is into rock music or just music period needs this album in your collection.  You don't have a serious collection without this one.  I own over 1100 CDs and if I had to choose 5 albums to save from a fire, this one is there along with ""A Tribute to Jack Johnson"" by Miles, ""Ultimate Blue Train"" by Coltrane, ""Animals"" by Pink Floyd, and ""Disintegration"" by The Cure.  Buy it today if you don't own it already. I've often wondered how many bands have been set aside because of comparisons to another band?  I like to read the reviews to determine whether I should write a review of an album.  Can I add to what has already been said?  The only negative reviews of The Stone Roses debut seem to misunderstand their direct lineage.  This band follows the path beaten down by Jesus & Mary Chain, Echo & the Bunnymen, U2, REM,  New Order/Joy Division and possibly some of the 4AD label (I am sure their are others, these are the most notable).While I am able to recognize references to these bands, Stone Roses diverges into paths that are unexpected.  On one listen I might be sure the band sounds like Jesus & Mary Chain, then I  notice the vocals sink into the mix and are less aggressive than Jesus & Mary Chain.  Maybe a J &M; informed by REM, but wait that big bass stadium sound of U2, on and on, until I give up and just accept them as The Stone Roses plain and simple.  This is at once familiar and something new.  Most importantly, something drew ME in and kept ME listening.  This is an album that returns to my playlist often.In the end, what makes an album great?  This album is the pinion of entire genres (Shoegazer_Dream Rock/Pop_My Bloody Valentine, et al) yet it doesn't fit comfortably into a specific genre.  Does it stand the test of time? Has for me.  Does that mean you will like it?  Not necessarily.  Has it influenced bands that followed? No doubt.  The Stone Roses is an eye piece peering back to some great bands and the foundation of some great bands that have followed.Finally, great albums aren't always listen-able to the masses. One listens and appreciates .  Likewise, listen-able albums aren't necessarily great. The Stone Roses debut falls into that rare category that is, first and foremost, listen-able and, to those of us who immerse ourselves in way too much music consider to be, important and great. When I first listened to this album over ten years ago I firmly believed that I was in possession of the finest rock debut album ever.  It was certainly the finest one I had encountered.  I am now over forty and have  changed my opinion of The Stone Roses somewhat.  I now believe this to be  the finest rock album ever.  The sound captured the essence of a  fleeting  era in music; the Manchester Scene. But it has turned out to be so much  more than that as it has retained it's vitality years later. It appears as  if the music has a timeless quality on par with it's defining quality in  1989. It had few rivals in it's day and far fewer now.  Perhaps only  Pills  Thrills and Bellyaches or Screamadelica or for me, at least, New Order's  Technique could claim parity status.  I am grateful for all the lyrics,  guitar riffs and dancing pleasure that this recording brings.  But I can't  help but wonder what might have been had there been a bit more from them.  It is truely amazing that most of America missed this one.  In the end  though all that matters is the music and this one is a melodic masterpiece  meant from the very beginning to be adored. There is not much more to say about this album than what others have already said. Music can't change the world, but great music can change people's emotions and alter their expectations of what is possible. The Stone Roses' debut was one of those albums that came along in late 1988 and through word of mouth and a lot of hype began to turn the tide ever so slightly in the US in terms of what people liked and were ready for. It was not a smash, multiplatinum disc that led to years of ... follow-ups and overblown tours (that would be Oasis) but it was a stealth attack that was like some kind of sweet, vague wind that swept over a few hundred thousand listeners.No one wrote melodies or guitar leads as strong as John Squire, and no one else but mad 'King Monkey"" Ian Brown could whisper over them so seductively. This never gets old. It stands up, irregardless of the decade or fads.  The band burned bright, died young, and left a beautiful corpse. The greatest, most complete album I have ever owned, bar none.  I've owned it for nearly a decade now, and it is one of the few albums that I never tire of. Typically offensive Brit-indie record. Arrogance rooted in Brit-art-pop school aristocratic nonsense. Sounded fairly epochal to bored middle-classers and British music critics. Achieve appropriate balance of Brit-pop and acid-ecstasy vibes on ""Fool's Gold."" Absolute, unparalleled brilliance from the slow build-up of &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; to the funky climax of &quot;Fool's Gold&quot;, this album is just so dang important - and not just because without it, there would never have been an Oasis.  The opening bars of &quot;She Bangs The Drums&quot; are still as inspired as the first time I heard them, years and years on.  Recommended to all, as this does not fit neatly into any one musical category - if music could change the world, this would definitely be the catalyst. From the first song to the last, this album has everything. We need more music like this! oh man, what a great, great album. Just really good innovative brit-pop. It's obvious that each and every one of them were extremely accomplished musically and the songwriting is flawless. Very catchy vocal hooks, a bright, crisp and clear sound, well-thought out chord changes and melodies, it's got everything! Well it's actually not completely perfect...the only bummer has to be the annoying ""Don't Stop"" which sounds like a backwards ""Waterfall"", a song that comes directly before it...but it's just a minor distraction. Otherwise every song is a winner and I would recommend it to anyone. if miles davis' 'a kind of blue' is the definitive jazz album, the roses self-titled debut is the definitive post-1985 brit-rock album.  most of the 200+ reviews here on amazon are written, i assume, by dyed-in-the-wool roses fans.  consequently a lot of the reviews are biased--and that's understandable.  so, to those who've never heard the roses,  here's why you should pick up this album.1) the marriage of dance and rock. the roses were among the first to incorporate dance beats into classic guitar rock, and we can thank reni for that (a hugely underappreciated drummer). it's most evident in 'fool's gold,' -- still one of the greatest songs ever written.2) john squire. mr. squire is a *witch* on the guitar. his solo during the last five minutes of 'i am the resurrection' leaves little doubt the man sold his soul to the devil. if the devil does indeed find work for idle hand to do, john squire must have been one idle little kid.3) the songs.  top to bottom there's really not a dull moment. 'i wanna be adored' is probably one of the greatest album openers ever, and signals a rallying cry to what would become their legion of fans. it builds slowly, like an train picking up speed, before exploding into john squire's signature riffage. after that thrilling into, the band never let up. the sequencing is brilliant and relentless. 'she bangs the drums,' 'elephant stone,' made of stone,' 'shoot you down' (itself a highly jazzy number), and 'sugar spun sister' (and it's curious 'sticky-fingered boy' lyric) are the perfect blend of dance and rock.  the production is *perfect.* the album never gets bogged down with brass, strings, etc.  this is the classic four man lineup--guitar, bass, vocals, drum. no filler, no fluff.4) sheer enthusiasm and exuberance. they were a band primed for greatness and in listening to songs like 'i wanna be adored' and 'i am the resurrection,' you get the feeling the band knew it--and they were right, which makes it's all the more astonishing.  it's very much a statement album, a statement that forever changed the british musical landscape. i don't think it's stretch to say that without the roses, there would be no oasis, no blur, no verve, no suede, no charlatans.5) let's face it--this album's got cache. any self-respecting music fan *has* to have this album. not only is it essential listening, it will get you bucketloads of cool points--at least in certain circles.the roses, sadly defunct (can a reunion really be that far off?), remain as influential 15 years after their debut as the were the day it was released.  i assume this is an album each successive generation will discover anew. I became a fan of Oasis in 1994, a fan of Blur in 1995, a fan of Ocean Colour Scene in 1996....I DIDN'T GET TO THIS ALBUM UNTIL 2001!!!  Well better late than never you know.  This album is one of the most amazing British rock albums ever.  The songs are flawless, the production is flawless, the musicianship etc., etc., etc.  It was like a version of ""Revolver"" for 1989.  Every Brit pop-rock band that came after these guys sites the Stone Roses as one of their primary influences....almost right next to or even surpassing the Beatles.  Not since albums from the late 1960s had a track sequence sounded so invigorating and cohesive.  This album belongs in anyone's collection who even skimps at British rock.  It's a masterpiece from beginning to end! This is one of the rare collections of songs where you can buy the full album with confidence that you'll have more than 1 or 2 tracks to enjoy. Basicamente creo que los STONE ROSES, es lo mejor que pudo ocurrir a finales de los 80's, pr&aacute;cticamente ya iniciando los 90's, este album es perfectamente audible en su totalidad...y aunque no creo que exista un ""re-encuentro"" ya que Ian Brown sigue muy fuerte como solista y muy enfocado a su trabajo - que por cierto excelente rola con Noel Gallaher (Oasis) ""Keep what ya got"" - pero el trabajo ya realizado es de muy buena calidad y que ha dejado huella en otras bandas que han sido influenciadas x sus sonidos e inclusive en sus letras &iexcl;&iexcl;Aqu&iacute; les dejo a los hispano-parlantes (hasta el mismo Ian, tiene una rola en espa&ntilde;ol) para que consideren este CD (en 5 a&ntilde;os desconozco si se utilizara el mismo formato) para su colecci&oacute;n mel&oacute;mana.Saludos otra vez desde Zapopan, Jal. MEXICOMORK This first album from Manchester band The Stone Roses has often been singled out as one of the most important albums released in the 1980's. I can not disagree that this is an exciting and beautiful album and will not hesitate to give it five stars. On the other hand I feel that there is a tendency to overestimate its impotance when compared with the best of the Beatles, the Kinks and the Who. This serves neither the group nor the album, as it inevitably will lead to disappointed listeners with the wrong expectations.Enough said about this; to the album and its music. Musically  group seems inspired by the American sound of the midsixties, created especially by the Byrds, but also a group like The Bobby Fuller Four  easily comes in your mind when you listen to specific songs.First and foremost is melodic pop-rock music spiced occasional sharp edges and psychedelic guitar solos.Most numbers are actually very well put together, but obviously tracks like ""She Bangs the Drums"", ""Waterfall"", ""Do not Stop"", ""Sugar Spun Sister"", ""Made of Stone"" (the songs that first made me think of Bobby Fuller) and ""Shoot You Down"" first and foremost will capture new listeners' ears.A pity that the group never managed to fulfill the promises the debut album gave, and the group dissolved after a disappointing second album. When Mike & The Mechanics ushered in the `Madchester' scene with The Living Years it was only a matter of time before these jokers attempted to jump on the bandwagon. If you want to be adored you should write some decent songs lads!Verdict: don't waste your money. The stone roses for me are probably the best band ever to come on the face of the earth, in my opinion anyway. this new legacy edition provides you with the full remasterd debut album,with bonus track 'fools gold', a full album of lost demos, including the singles and some of their b-sides and a lost demo that is called 'pearl bastard', which i reckon, with a little bit of tidying up, could of made a fantastic track. then theirs the dvd disc with the roses performing live in blackpool in 1989, which also includes three or four videos of some of the roses songs, and plus its got a great booklet inside with loads of pictures and interviews with ian brown and mani. well worth the purchase. Sublime, uplifting, life affirming masterpiece.Removes the need for anyone to ever take drugs again as listening to this album will make you happier and higher than taking crack, heroin and angel dust combined. Should be distributed free at drug rehabilitaion centres.Each killer track flows perfectly into the next. Lyrical references to god, the devil and the bible are appropriate as listening to 'I am the Resurrection' transports you to a higher spiritual plain.Inspiring to know something so god-like and timeless was created by human beings - Genius! this is the greatest album ever made. i don't know how it happened, but the band have made an album which trancends everything that you could say about it. The brilliance lies in the way the songs sound so achingly beautiful. Every note chimes, every word breaks your heart. it is a work of genius, and one which reminds you that the gap between being great, and being genius, is vast. People will listen to this album in a thousand years time, and be moved. they are almost too good to be real, and the way they crashed and burned, it's like the world couldn't cope with something so perfect. i saw these live once when i was a kid, listen to this cd and you'll know what i mean. This album may be considered overrated for anyone familiar with a some music-related publications, such as the New Musical Express (NME) and the British newspaper The Observer, which both placed it as #1 on a list of Best Albums and Best British Albums respectively. In another sense, it may be seen as underrated because when you mention ""The Stone Roses"", (unless, perhaps, you are somewhere in Great Britain or are talking to a well-versed music fan), nobody knows who you are talking about! At any rate, I feel that this album deserves attention.The Stone Roses (formed in 1984 in Manchester, England and disbanding in 1996) only released two albums, but have left a considerable impact on British music. They were considered a premier band of the ""Madchester"" genre (along with others like the Happy Mondays), which blended dance music with more 60s-inspired, psychedelic-style rock. This becomes immediately apparent when listening to any of the songs on their debut album, with the complex layers of instruments melding together lyrics and melodies. Instead of skipping around, I generally listen to it from start to finish, since the album flows very nicely from song to song.I first found out about The Stone Roses from an Elijah Wood article in Blender magazine. He said that his most favourite album of all-time could be the debut from The Stone Roses, which he had first listened to when they were filming The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand. After I noticed it appearing on various lists of ""Best Albums"" as well, I decided to buy it and find out what the fuss was about. I was really pleasantly surprised. Even though I bought it several months ago, I still listen to the whole album fairly often. I'm not so sure that I'd say it was the best album I've heard, but I'd probably put it somewhere in my top ten. There are some albums that defy words and defines Generations, Oasis Definetly maybe, The Beatles White album, Primal Screams Screamadelica, Nirvanas Nevermind this album is better than any of them. From the opening  bassline of I Wanna be adored, to the white boy funk of Fools Gold, this  album lifts you up and places you on a peak so high, you can see the whole  of the world. Writen by four guys from Manchester, this is an album that  sounds like none that have gone before and although it is getting on for 12  years old, it still sounds as fresh as the day it was made, fusing reggae  and dub beats, psychodlia, sixties rock, house music, this is an  incrediable album, all the tracks are standouts, but, I wanna be adored,  Waterfall, Song (for my sugar spun sister) and Made of stone distill the  essence of this album, beautiful and love lorn but with a hard jagged edge.  This is the sound of a band playing there finest ever concert, nobody is in  control, no body is trying to out play anybody else, this is the sound of a  band playing in total harmony, the players are'nt the star of this album,  the music is. The band only made one album after this, the shambolic Second  comming, but on this album, they have no peers, taking music to places it  has never been before and can only ever hope to go again.Of the four  members, only singer Ian Brown has managed to capture the swagger, the  style and the mystercisum of this album, the solo work of guitarist John  Squire captures the sound of the Second coming, which is unfortunately a  huge dissapointement.  If you own this album, you'll know what I,m talking  about, if you don't, why not? Everybody should own this album it is the  finest album ever made. I have to say that this is my most treasured possession in the world. A real treasure of an album.The UK version (which is the version that gets all the plaudits in the polls) includes neither Fools Gold nor Elephant Stone. The UK release is the original version - please buy that 11-track version, as this is how it was meant to be heard and flows much better. Simply the best album ever to be recorded.Please don't buy this version, though. This is the US version, which is different from the original release - the UK version has neither Fools Gold nor Elephant Stone. Buy the import version, as it flows much better than this version. I had heard many great things about this album by a group I had never  heard of before. I had delayed buying it for a long time for no reason.  Then, I finally decided to but it. At first listen I didn't know what to  think. I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. I could tell songs like She  Bangs The Drums, Bye Bye Badman, Sugar Spun Sister and Made of Stone  equaled the hype I had heard. But alot of the album sounded like noise. I  decided to listen again. This time I payed much more attention. I soon  realized that The Stone Roses was even more incredible than I had Heard. It  remains one of my favorite albums. Buy it. This is the album that started it all. Everything you've heard about The Stone Roses, it all was/is/remains well deserved. The Stone Roses are the type of band that Nirvana and the rest of the Seattle grunge 'movement' wished they could have been. Not only does this record capture the spirit of the times, it's still fresh and relevant today as it was in 1989. Every song on this debut is monumental.Buy. This. Album. For a standard vocalist, guitarist, bass player, and drummer, British pop/rock doesn't get any better. Forget Oasis, The Stone Roses first release is the standard.I started listening to this CD about three years ago. I wasn't lucky enough to have the exposure to the band when they were relatively unknown outside of England. Lucky for me that when I did hear it, I found it excellent.The songs might not have been too radio friendly when released. Only 'She Bangs The Drums', 'Elephant Stone', and 'Sugar Spun Sister' (not including 'Elizabeth My Dear') are under 4 minutes. The rest of the songs contain classic verses and choruses, but also aren't in a rush. The last two songs 'I Am The Resurrection' and 'Fools Gold' are both over eight minutes, and worth every second.The music is relatively straight forward. Basic chord changes. You won't hear sonic layers like 'Pet Sounds' from the Beach Boys (I just listened to that one). Guitar, vocals, bass, and drums eloquently fused to create a beautiful coherent sound. Classically simple. It's the kind of music that every garage or high school band might be capable of creating, but just don't. That is the lure of this music for me. Maybe, just maybe, it isn't beyond my grasp.As far as favorite tracks. I'll leave aside the obvious picks. 'Elephant Stone' shouldn't be missed. Listen for some of the drumming, snares especially.Enjoy. The Stone Roses are one the defining artists of the late Eighties. When they first came on the scene their name was Graffitied all over Manchester. Simply fans of the Roses Knew what was coming and needed to share it with the world! and on the evidence of this record they knew their stuff!! some amazing classics like I wanna be Adored, I am the resurrection, Waterfall just to mention a few. Basically all the songs on this album are classics. I agree with all the previous reviews that have given it a massive 5 stars. Not all these people can be wrong! Just go and buy it trust me you will not be dissapointed!! I grew up in Longsight , Manchester , England and this album is especially  important for a huge number of people who come from Manchester- It is great  to see so many American reviewers who hold this album in high esteem.Faultless end to end and only bettered by their second &amp; final  album.Mere words cannot justify this album I think Fools Gold might be the finest few minutes of music there is. I don't toke up, but if I did, I would hit repeat on the CD player and float away...or something like that. Beautiful songcraft. Every track on this album is a spine tingler, especially the jam out session at the end of I am The Resurrection. Its a timeless classic. don't believe the nerds who complain about recording quality or tone-deafness. the stone roses provide pure pop bliss.top 100 lists, classic?, not classic?, groundbreaking or not, who really cares? This is the greatest album ever made. It has without doubt the greatest rhythm section ever in Mani and Reni. Although he is quite blantently a fool, Squire's guitar licks set off perfectly as the bass and drums gush  out of the speakers. Hell, even Brown's voice sounds made for the song's  here. Possibly a concept album, telling the Roses' story from ambition to  godlike status. The version I have doesn't have Fools Gold on and I for one  think it is better off without it. Is there any better way to finish an  album than with the acid-loaded beat psycadelica that is I Am The  Ressurection? I should at this point say that although it shouldn't be  here, Fools Gold is the greatest piece of sound that mankind, or any other  type of life can create. Fact. No dispute. The groundbreaking dance-like  shuffle of Reni's kit leads to to what is undisputibly the greatest and  most recognisable bassline ever. Come on, you all know it. Doh doh doh,  doh, doh dohdohdohdohdoh. Squire's shakey-wrist guitar action almost takes  backstage. And of course there's Ian Brown's ghostly distant vocals. He was  born to sing this song. Fools Gold will completely take over your mind and  body for 9 minutes and 53 seconds and try as you might, you cannot resist.  The lyrics, like the best Roses songs, are typically swaggery and  egotistical, or at least they would be if they didn't live up to them.  &quot;I'm standing alone, I'm watching you all, I'm seeing you  sinking&quot;. ie. &quot;we've just reinvented what is good and what  isn't&quot;. oh yeah, the other songs. Well, I Wanna Be Adored menacingly  strides out from beyond the horizon to tell you exactly what's going to  happen next. Yet dispite this, the shear explosion of technicolour melody  that is She Bangs the Drums still shocks and exhilerates you. Waterfall,  built around a gorgeous riff, makes you want more. And it comes, in the  shape of its stoned little brother, Don't Stop. Elizabeth My Dear orders  her Maj off her perch (and who would she be to argue?). Shoot You Down is a  blissed out soundscape and This Is The One tells you in the title what you  are witnessing. The final two songs, as I have said are two of the greatest  sounds recordings ever, Iam The Ressurection representing the Stone Roses  coronation as Kings of all who stood before them.  The Beatles may be the  originals, The Clash may have shown what was wrong, and Oasis may have  kidknapped and held hostage the zeitgeist, but can any of them truely match  this album? This has to be the greatest album in my collection.  It changed music, this is an album that will leave you wondering if these are the next, the ones to become the best, to beat the beatles and others.  A truley complete  album that rivles that of revolver,sgt peppers.  A band that in the late  80's created something, something that is still going today.  Amazing  guitar played buy squires, and brillient vocals buy brown that become even  better as the songs roll on.  They are a band that did not last that long,  but in there time they were the best and still are.  To this day others  try, in vein, to come close.  Their was no aragonse with this band just  great music. Dont let people tell you that since the 60's there have been  no great bands, there have, these are one of them. THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT. When this album was a big deal I didn't even know it existed. Our first child took up any music time that used to be. Now she's in graduate school and the Stone Roses play around here quite a bit. Even being from another time and another place this music is powerful stuff. This remastered edition is the straight record with one bonus track--Fool's Gold. Granted, the Deluxe version has an extra disc of recordings and a 3rd disc dvd of their famous concert. Much more fun I'm sure. Lately though, I've purchased a couple of remasters without all the bonus historical theater and been quite happy with a better version of the album I knew so well. As far as being ""the greatest album of all time"" (NME) I personally don't think that recording is here yet, but it is thoroughly amazing. I love listening and dancing with it--it chases away all the geezeritis--for a while. Then I put it on again. Fool's Gold was made for dancing. I heard thisone 1996,first i think that it was one  of those borin' britpop records.But one of those terrible hangover sundays i suddenly realize that it was and it is one of the greatest rock albums ever made.and  very dancable too.after that i had to listen it too much,but sometimes i  pick it up again and have to listen hole album maybe twice and don't stop  three or four times.Their charisma was also very glorious for me like no  other bands(exept rolling stones)before that and they oppened many ways  bands like suede,blur,oasis etc.just buy this one an' listen it and you can  hear marvellous rock music comin out your loudspeakers. Everyone has their own Stone Roses story, and I am no different.  I was only nine when this album came, and obviously was too busy with my Batman  fetish to follow the Madchester scene.  As a 14 year old alt-radio fan, I  dug &quot;Love Spreads,&quot; but assumed it was the work of minor, almost  one-hit-wonder caliber band.Thus, I was caught by surprise when, in  the course of reading up on the British scene throughout the '90s, I  learned that these same Stone Roses were responsible for one of the most  significant albums of the past 15 years.On reputation alone, I ordered  the album, not having heard a single track.  It is now among my 3 or 4  favorite albums.  It is nothing short of magic.&quot;I Wanna Be  Adored&quot; is powerful enough to give me chills.  It contains essentially  one line, yet that line speaks volumes.  &quot;She Bangs the Drums&quot; is  typical Roses - the chorus is practically perfect.  I dare you to try  escaping the pure pop catchiness of &quot;Elephant Stone.&quot;  &quot;Bye  Bye Madman&quot; features wonderfully subtle tempo changes.  &quot;Made of  Stone&quot; is both brutal and beautiful, again with a genius of a chorus.  &quot;This Is the Stone&quot; is pure bliss.  &quot;I am the  Resurrection&quot; features a great build-up, followed by a wildly  different jam session, yet closes the album perfectly.  Included here also  is the greatest white-boy funk song of all, &quot;Fools Gold.&quot;This  is the perfect album for a sunny summer day.  If only I had been old enough  in that glorious summer of 1989 to discover the magic firsthand.  Buy this  now and recreate your own Summer of Love. This is the greatest album ever. shove dark side of the moon, radiohead or the beatles up your ass...this is the greatest album ever. Beautiful, catchy, poppy British pop rock.Just good stuff.Give it a listen. It is a shame this album wasn't a bigger hit. What more can be said? If yuo've read the other reviews you'll know how good an album this is!  Basically all of the tracks are classics and ones that you'll want to listen to over and over again. From the melodic  and thoughtful I Wanna be Adored to the delightfully upbeat and catchy She  Bangs the Drums and the beautifully crafted Made of Stone.  THIS IS ONE OF  THE BEST BRITISH ALBUMS EVER!  I just hope that more people in the States  will bring it upon themselves to experience a masterpiece! I can safely say that this album is probably the finest debut ever made, if not the finest album altogther.  The album is timeless and one can lose themselves in a make believe world of sunshine and pure bliss when listening to its eleven perfect tunes.  From the opening song of i wanna be adored through to the majestic i am the ressurection each song is an individual classic blending to become an amazing sound.The first time i heard the album i was hooked and from then (i bought it in 1995) on it is still my most listened to album. Whatevr mood youre in it will add that feeling of hope and euphoria into your mind.There are many highlights of this album but mine must be the beautiful 'made of stone' with its brilliant guitar solo and ian browns haunting vocals.  Another most amazing part of this album is the fact that its not too commercial and is still a gem to find by many people.It is felt that the stone roses have influenced many bands such as oasis through to lesser known bands as puressence but one thing is for sure is that it has influenced anyone who has bought it and made them feel so much better. Had never heard of this band until recently.  Listened to it on iTunes and really liked it, but that was a remastered version.  The original CD sounds much rougher.  Some may like that.  I didn't. I bought The Stone Roses back in 89 or 90 when it was released in America. I had heard I Wanna Be Adored on the radio in NY and listened to the hype. The album was good, but I never got completely into it....until I popped it  in again a few years ago. Wow....The album finally resonated with me. It is  just a wall of beautifully crafted pop songs. This Is the One and I Am the  Resurrection are certain standouts as is Song for my Sugar-spun Sister.  John Squire's guitar work is about the best of the past decade (Johnny  Marr, Bernard Butler, Robert Smith included) and Ian Brown's hushed vocals,  while not a great singer, certainly have a personality of their own. Reni  and Mani's percussion combine to make it one of the all-time debut records  ever. Believe the hype. This was one of the greatest bands. I am at a loss of words on where to begin when reviewing this album.  I  definitely feel it's a great release from a band that unfortunately didn't  stick around too long. It doesn't sound like anything that was being  released in England at the time of the late 80's early 90's.  This is great  background album just let the music do the talking.  Some highlights I  enjoy are: &quot;I wanna be adored&quot;, &quot;Fools Gold&quot; and  &quot;Elephant Stone&quot;.  I can't imagine anyone really disliking this  CD even if they have a just fleeting interest in Brit pop.  I say if you  are reading this review and do not own this CD you most likely have a  geniune interest in the band and you shouldn't be leary about buying this  release.  I guarantee you will like it. As all the five star reviews will tell you, this is quite an amazing CD. If you like jangly guitar pop rock, not the frustratingly simple pop rock of today but one that have layers of sound on it. You will love this album. There isn't a lot to complain about this album, it has very catchy guitar, well timed rhythm section and absolutely amazing vocal. There is one track you want to skip on this CD, and that's Don't Stop(and please skip?). The rest of the songs are masterpieces. The other reviewers (so far) have provided a great summary of the historical significance of this album and much-improved sound-quality of this reissue. However, I find the omission of the finished version of 'Elephant Stone' from ALL versions of this 20th Anniversary 'Legacy' campaign to be downright mean-spirited. I don't know who is to blame... the artist or the label... but either way, I think it is just a cruel poke in the eye to long-time fans and collectors.I understand and sympathize that some artists have a desire to restore their work to its 'pure' form, that is, to strip away things (in this case, songs) that were forcibly inserted by their labels to show the record-buying public that they would get extra value by spending extra cash on the CD version rather than the cheaper LP or cassette versions. A notorious example was the original tacking-on of 'Perfect' at the end of The The's Soul Mining... which was then dropped when the album was reissued earlier this decade in order to conform to Matt Johnson's original intention for the album to end with the epic 'Giant.' However, what steamed me about taking a personal favorite like 'Perfect' away is the fact that it was offered nowhere else in remastered form, except for in an (IMO) inferior earlier 7"" single version on the 45RPM collection.The Stone Roses and/or their label do the same to us here by stripping 'Elephant Stone' from the track list. I'm fully aware that 'Elephant Stone' was a single predating the album (in fact, as a college radio DJ back then, the 12"" release got spun to death on my show for many, many months before the full LP was released). But why does that matter? The US CD version of this album that I've owned and loved for the past 20 years always had 'Elephant Stone' as Track 3. I never knew this album any other way. And what is truly bizarre is that the single 'Fools Gold' was another tack-on, but for some reason DOES find its way onto this reissue as a 'Bonus Track' (thank goodness!). If 'Fools Gold' can be a bonus track, why not 'Elephant Stone'!?Nick Cave apparently suffered the same problem with unwanted extra tracks on the CD versions of his albums in the 80s. The current reissue campaign for his work follows the 'take-away' approach as well. Perhaps anticipating some outcry about that, the label did see fit to include (inexplicably!) low-bitrate MP3s of the excised tracks on the accompanying DVDs. While that is a less-than-perfect solution... at least it's something. But here, with all the time & material that obviously went into remastering and putting together this otherwise excellent Stone Roses package, they couldn't even find a way to make room for 'Elephant Stone'? Or at least give you an access code to download a high-bitrate MP3 of a remastered version of the song (as The Feelies have done with their recent reissues)?I guess they wanted to leave something for the 30th Anniversary edition to entice us to buy it all over again... again. Ugh. I must say, I had never heard of this band.  I stumbled on these reviews by accident, read and then listened, and rushed ordered it. I was simply just blown away.  All of the songs are amazing,  It's tough to find something that stands out, but they all do.  I must have played Waterfall, I Want to be adored, Shoot you down, over and over.  I'm upset they are not around (or at least not played).  I missed all of this. This album meets all the criteria to be considered an all time great.  it still sounds a fresh and original years after it was released and is unlike most current music.  it was a cornerstone in launching a new musical movement - Madchester, it has influenced countless bands, Radiohead, Oasis and more or less every indie UK band.This Album has it all, great melodies, a interesting mix of songs from the bombastic and slighlty creepy &quot;I want to be adored&quot; , the beat driven rock of &quot; Elephant Stone&quot; , slightly goofy pop rock &quot;Bye Bye Badman&quot; and melodic hooks of &quot; She Bangs a Drum&quot;.The Stone Rise could have been the next big thing but  never reached their potential. They did produce one glorious album  that will ensure their place in Music history and in the collections of music  lovers. You can't really be called ground breaking when the best lyric on you've written you pulled straight from the bible. But it took several thousand years before that book got patched up with some new material making it acceptable to the masses; it only took 20 years for the Stone Roses to perfect sixties rock. Bible thumpers might want to ban this, as it's easily the most danceable rock album of all time. at the time of this albums release it spawned not only a brand new sound but a culture as well. british rock had suffered mortal blows to its ego before the arrival of this debut album. it was rescued from the tiring  banality of groups like duran duran and abc. the songwriting team of  brown/squire combine sweet melodies and lyrics which consider the  intangible things we all long for but arent quite sure how to express. im  not sure if i could explain what these feelings are but that is the  esoteric nature of it. i know i feel whole again after one listen. the  words flow out of Ian Brown's mouth with such grace and beauty and the  melliflous tones of John Squire's guitar are sonically abberated. those two  elements are as perfectly matched as sugar and spice. long live the roses  and madchester! People are starting to bash this CD.  Please, they are all wet!  This CD is PERFECT.  EVERY second of this CD is absolutely amazing.  Melodic, timeless(!!!), uplifting, thirst-quenching, day-breaking, love-making, soul saving.  The guitar playing is flawless (see: JAMMING last 5 minutes of I Am The Resurrection).  The airy vocals of Ian Brown (heard throughout).  The driving bass (Fool's Gold/I Am The Resurrection) and ecstatic drums (She Bangs the Drums, This Is The One, Fool's Gold).  There is not one dud in the whole group.  I have listened to this CD HUNDREDS of times and it still makes me feel like life is perfect (although it is far from it).If you like pop music.  If you aren't a crabby, contrarian.  (fragmented sentences for dramatic effect. ;) )  If you LOVE great tunes, BUY THIS CD and enrich your life.  You'll thank me for gushing like this when you experience this work of genius.  I am not being generous, I am being honest. I'm SO stupid for discovering The Stone Roses for myself so late.  It's funny, I've been enjoying them even though I hadn't gotten into them until about 2 years ago.  I've already listened to them through Blur, the Verve, and Oasis--some of my favorite bands.Well, if you like amazing beats, beautiful harmonies and melodies, LOOK NO FURTHER.  Like me writing a review will add something that no one else here has...I still had to rave about this CD pseudo-publicly.  Every single song is 5 stars, but my favorite is the epic raver, &quot;Fool's Gold&quot; where I believe the BritPop boom chug chugga-a-chug chug beat originated.  The bass line popping in and out driving you mad...  I can't even form complete sentences writing about this CD.  Enjoy this CD for the masterpiece it is.  It's worth 10x what Amazon is charging.To me, The Stone Roses is an original band; however, I'm surprised that I rarely hear anyone mention the Simon &amp; Garfunkel influences in their music.  Specifically, of course, &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot; which is the melody of &quot;Scarborough Faire&quot; (which really isn't technically a Simon &amp; Garfunkel original), but a little more abstractly, &quot;Bye Bye Badman&quot;, which suggestively leads into &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot;.  Everytime I hear &quot;Bye Bye Badman&quot; I'm reminded of middle/early years Simon and Garfunkel harmonies and melodies.  This isn't alone the only influence I hear, but it is a strong one.Long live The Stone Roses!!! Judging by the previous 50 or so reviews you might be under the opinion that this is a bit of a classic album.......classic is too small a word to discribe the magnitude of this CD,it will go down in musical history as one  of the most important musical pices ever.Good to see so many fans from the  other side of the Atlantic with such fine taste. Vinyl came on time and the quality of the vinyl was exceptional. I'm really enjoying the record and reliving my youth. Great job!!! I bought this album in 1990, after seeing the video for &quot;She Bangs The Drums&quot; on &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, the old MTV show which I and my friends watched religiously every Sunday. Twelve years later, &quot;Stone Roses&quot; remains in heavy rotation, resting imperiously atop a pile of disappointing lesser CD's with one or two good(ish) songs on them (Four Non-Blondes, I want my money back!).This album has everything you could wish for in modern music. It's consistently funky, intelligent and chock full of the wrenching, visceral guitar work that any rock and roller must have. There is something to be said for a record that makes you want to boogie and play air guitar at the same time. John Squire, as so many other reviewers have mentioned, really was/is a new kind of guitar hero. His playing is enormously skillful but he never gives in to the temptation to take himself too seriously. His taste is seemingly infallible and despite the very grand sound of some of the songs (She Bangs The Drums, This Is The One), bombast is non-existent on this record.Ian Brown's lyrics are intelligent and ironic and his singing style is perfect for them. He maintains a cool distance throughout, which is especially effective on the Oh-so-English &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot;, a macabre little ditty set to the tune of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;.On this side of the pond, we missed out on the &quot;second summer of love&quot; and the much-ballyhooed &quot;Madchester&quot; scene. I've since heard a lot of the music from that era e.g. Inspiral Carpets, Happy Mondays etc. and some of it is pretty good. However, the Stone Roses are the only band whose contribution transcends the genre and 13 years after its release this album sounds as fresh and inventive as it did when it first arrived.The American version of the album that I bought didn't have &quot;Fools Gold&quot; on it, and it was several years later that I finally got a copy of that track, coincidentally on a &quot;120 Minutes&quot; compilation CD. The inclusion of that funk masterpiece on the version that is for sale here only serves to further elevate a truly magnificent record. The bass line is as insanely catchy a piece of legitimate funk as anything Bootsy Collins ever dreamt of. John Squire shows that he's as much a master of funk-wah playing as he is of Townsendian power-chording. Bravo.Now, if only they hadn't been such a lazy and difficult bunch of prima donnas, there might be a greater body of work to enjoy. Alas, Stone Roses, we hardly knew ye! Mind-blowingly brilliant album that is guaranteed not to disappoint fans of melodic guitar-driven rock. The US and UK versions are identical. A seminal album that laid the foundation for the later Manchester bands , like Oasis, that ultimately shaped the Britpop movement. This album still sounds as fresh and interesting in 2008 as it did in 1989. If only they would remaster it...... With their soaring vocal melodies and virtuosos playing guitar, bass, and drums, the Stone Roses were poised to be the biggest band in the world until it went all wrong in the 1990's.  This is their debut and their absolute zenith.  From the haunting build-up in I Wanna Be Adores to the sheer happiness of She Bangs the Drums and Elephant Stone, to the jaw-dropping psychdelic freak-out jam that ends the sublime I Am the Resurrection, and the tripped-out dancebeats of Fools Gold (tacked on the USA version...it was originally a single), this album is just awesome. Essential listening. I should have taken heed per Alan Williamson. I'd heard this band could be like Led Zeppelin. I was hoping for something like that or maybe a Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam or Nirvana.If you're looking for the kind of music I've just referred to, the Stone Roses aren't going to do it for you. i am not much for writing reviews, and this release made it easy in that it is simply outstanding. fans of this band will enjoy the remastered sound as well as all the b-sides. the super good release came with the vinyl and a usb drive as well. quite the collector's edition. i am very pleased. This album (still use that term) will be 20 years old next month.  One of the best British outputs ever.  Almost fitting that they had the label dispute with Silvertone Records that they did.  How do you follow that up?Revolver and Sgt. Peppers in the 60's, Skylarking from XTC and this one from the late 80's.  Totally unique.  Great artwork from Squire as well.A must listen for anyone, especially the under 30 crowd. The hearing of this work - for me 1990 - was a benchmark in my experience of popular/alternative/dance/rock music.  Quite amazingly as well, was hearing for the first time, about the same time, Joy Division's Closer (both from Factory and Manchester) - two guiding hallmarks of the finest virtuosity - in lyric and music - still to this day.  Even if it's not within your regular musical tastes - it's worth, at least, one hearing... Just received it this afternoon, great photos and interviews, what can you say about this record that has not been said. A true classic album. I bought this when it originally came out on vinyl. I'm a big fan of catchy pop music and heard good things about it. I'm really baffled that people are giving this such great reviews. I tried listening to it many times and it just never got my attention. Once, I put it on and about 10 minutes later I found myself thinking, ""I should put some music on."" I forgot that it was on. Well, okay, the Thai Stick might have had something to do with it; but you know what I mean. When The Stone Roses was released it caused shock to almost all the music scene.It sounded fresh,revolutionary,and a mix of arrogant and tender at times.It took time for many to accept that  you either had to love or hate this record.I love it,although sometimes it is hard for me to dig so much mancunian psychedelia in a single session coming to mind the excesses of the Happy Mondays times.I mean John Squire was a guitar hero but sometimes he overshadows the rest of the band.Here the only bad thing.Now, the complexity of the songwriting...Songs like I am the resurrection,Made of stone or  I wanna be adored are so rich,well produced well performed and well arranged that it would take U2 or Coldplay this life and further reencarnations to release songs of that quality and genius.I imagine notes flowing through the veins of this guys, not blood when they went to the studio.The drum tempo changes in the songs are amazing and vocals fit in perfectly.Now that`s what i call manchester music.Excellent!P.S  If i`d talk about their second, i`d bash them a little bit but that`s another story.... It is hard to fully describe the unique, peculiar level of aesthetic beauty and songcraft present on this debut album from the Stone Roses.  This music is melodically and harmonically extraordinary, and as the album winds on and its players dig in, it becomes something even more, a phenomenal blur of psychedelic transcendental magic.The opener ""I Wanna Be Adored"" seems to drift out of heaven with its distant rumblings.  As the funky bass line emerges from the noise and the layers of shimmering guitar harmonies cascade over the ominous rhythms, the stage is set for a revelatory musical journey.  After this opening swirl of drama, ""She Bangs The Drums"" makes a perfect entry, its endlessly catchy, carefree melody taking the listener to a different world.  And these two songs are but the beginning...There is rarely a dull or unenlightening moment on any of these 13 masterpieces; even ""Don't Stop,"" which is ""Waterfall"" played backwards, is strangely interesting, and ""Elizabeth My Dear,"" a one-minute interlude set to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair,"" is a great political protest.  The album's true shining moment is its conclusion--few albums in recent memory have resolved themselves so well.  The 13-minute firestorm that is ""This Is The One/I Am The Resurrection"" is a masterstroke not soon to be replicated by many rocks bands--the triumphant guitars of the former song, which recall the harmonious work of The Byrds, and the sweeping instrumental solos on the latter are as close to pop Valhalla as most bands ever get.Although this album never went platinum and was basically ignored outside of Britain, it is one of the best releases of the 80s and a watershed within the history of Britpop and proto-shoegazer music.  Some critics continue to downplay its quality and impact, saying that it is simplistic and overly naive, but its charm is elusive and indelible If this band had a better singer with better lyrics then i would give it 5 stars. Everything thing  else about it  is good. The problem with the singer is that he mumbles to much and his lyrics are dull and repetive especially on i want to be adored. Another problem with this cd it is way to long i usually end up skipping the last two songs. Not to be redundant but simply put this is one of the  best albums of all time...I got into Stone Roses when they debuted in '89...There was a period when I wasnt listening to them for a while--just into other stuff..I picked  up my CD the other day and just remembered how great this album  is...Haven't put anything else in since then...Too bad they are  done...There isnt one bad track on this album --- My favorite has to be  &quot;I am the Resurection&quot; My teen years were the 80's and I was stuck in new wave hell along with heavy 'hair' metal that all just seemed like b.s. to me.  Soulless sonic pollution with few exceptions.  There was the indie music scene and I loved bands like the Replacements and fIREHOSE but I always loved the 60's and 70's stuff.  Particularly classic rock and blues with some punk thrown in. Bands like Culture Club and Men Without Hats just weren't going to work for me.  Towards the end of the 80's, I was getting ancy and was really looking for music that reflected the spirit and soul of earlier decades but was contemporary.  I was in NYC in '89 when The Stone Roses came out and it slammed me when I heard it. It was absolutely stunning. Loaded with attitude, fresh song writing, creative composition and superior musicianship.  The guitar work was dreamy beautiful, the vocals and lyrics were mysterious, psychedelic and cynical, the drumming was funky and powerful and the bass was groovy.  Finally a band of my time that I could get behind.  I listened to this album, if not every day, every other day for a solid year.  It was inspiring and bewitching and just as important, indicated that the end of overly produced, slick corporate, bar lowering musical slog was near.  Soon after came the Seattle grunge scene which forced popular music earthbound and though healthy, didn't seem to have the uplifting/spiritual qualities that resonate on The Stone Roses. It's been 20 some years since it came out and it stands up to repeat listens. Every song is great. Some songs transcend up from there. This album is a rare something special.  A perfect album. Two discs-59 and 64 minutes each approximately.  There is a DVD included with this set,consisting of live footage from 1989 and six videos of a number of the tracks from the original album.  The packaging is nice-a quadruple-fold out,with the three discs snapped in plastic keepers.  The booklet has a number of good color photographs of the band members.  There are also several pages on the band and its music by Ian Brown and Gary ""Mani"" Mounfield,plus an overview by John Robb.  On my copy of their first album from a number of years ago,there's a finished track,""Elephant Stone"",that's not listed on this current release,except in different form as a demo.  This,and other singles/early tracks can be found on other releases such as ""The Complete Stone Roses"" album,although a number of tracks are shortened in length.  Another fine collection is ""Turns Into Stone"",which contains fewer tracks but they are full length.  A lot of other tracks are also on the limited edition box set,which contains (among a lot of other stuff) another disc of tracks.  Likewise,on the current release,""Fools Gold"" is listed on the back of the package,but not on the inside,under the disc,with the other tracks.  There is also a ""surprise"" at the end of the demo disc.  Fifteen tracks are listed,but the CD player lists twenty.  There's nothing until track twenty-enjoy!The original album is considered to be one of the best albums of all time ( in Britain) by a number of critics and fans.  And for good reason.  It came out at just the right time.  A combination of bits of acid house,punk,pop,and a bit of psychedelia mixed together-it was the perfect sound for the times.  The band was influenced by another group,XTC,under the guise,THE DUKES OF STRATOSPHEAR,and their perfect re-creation/homage to sixties psychedelic/pop music,and it shows.  The songs ""The Waterfall"",and ""Don't Stop"",are perfect examples of THE STONE ROSES  style.  The first track has a mixture of acid house feel,sixties style psychedelic guitar,suitably trippy (""shes a waterfall"") lyrics,with a pop music sound.  The latter song takes the psychedelic guitar/vocal sound even further to great effect. After a few changes in personnel,the band settled on Ian Brown-vocals,John Squire-guitar,Gary Mounfield-bass,and Alan ""Reni"" Wren-drums and backing vocals.  But one of the best things the band did was hire the fine producer (BEATLES,John Lennon,George Harrison,etc.) John Leckie.  He took the band's somewhat retro sound and up-dated their music and produced a huge,euphoric,somewhat spacey sound that fit the times perfectly.By now most people have heard the band's first (and best) album.  While the sound of the original release was good,this addition is just a bit cleaner,crisper.  There is an immediacy to the vocals,which are up front,along with that great guitar sound,that helped define this band.  Both the bass and the drums are a bit cleaner in this new version,and add greatly to the band's sound.  Overall,this new version only intensifies the band's sound.  But what this album has going for it is a certain,undefinable ""something"".  Everything seems to bend and flow together into a sound that's quite arresting and powerful.  From the first track,""I Wanna Be Adored"",into ""She Bangs The Drums"",through to ""I Am The Ressurection"",this album doesn't let up in its appeal.  The ""bonus"" track,""Fools Gold"",is a bit confusing to me,as its on my original  copy of the album,in all its full length glory.  Possibly it wasn't on the original British release or subsequent releases of the album.  For those who don't own this song,its a welcome addition-fitting in seamlessly with the rest of the tracks.  Twenty years on,the power and intensity of this album lives on,which is proof of its timelessness and appeal.The second disc of ""lost demos"" is not a collection of throwaways.  While lacking the power of the finished tracks (naturally),these demos give a deeper view into the band and Leckie's production.  Are they truly worthwhile?  Yes.  Besides giving a look into the first album's finished sound,a number of tracks are enjoyable on their own merit.  Besides demos of several of the original album tracks,there's a number of songs that were tried out,that didn't make it onto the first album.  The sound on these demos is far better than the bands first demos,heard on ""Garage Flower"".  Examples like ""Going Down"" has an almost early r&r; feel to it.  ""Something's Burning"",a low key combination of pop and psychedelia,has the feel of the original album's sound,and would fit in seamlessly.  ""One Love"" has that STONE ROSES guitar sound,with the rhythm section wrapped around it,which is one of the high points of these demos.For those familiar with this record,this is a good buy,with worthwhile extra tracks and good sound.  For those unfamiliar with this band,give some of these tracks a listen-you,too,will be captivated,and wonder how something this good slipped by you unnoticed. Over a decade on from the Manchester scene which spawned the Roses, the Happy Mondays, and various other lesser bands, &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; is pretty much the only album from that time which survives with its dignity intact.  From start to finish, every track is still an absolute classic, infused with John Squire's inventive guitar and the pulsating genius of the rhythm section.  There are albums which are called 'timeless' but fail to cross generational lines or break across predefined musical genres, but this album effortlessly bypasses both of the aforementioned hurdles.  Its appeal is practically universal, its songs still sound as bright and optimistic as the day you first heard them, and it IS timeless in every definition of the word.  There are bands that want to influence music and there are bands that talk about having an influence on music, but this is a band that really DID influence and forever alter the musical landscape.  Its influence can be heard in practically every guitar-based British band of the nineties and its presence still towers over those who have tried to copy its blueprint.  I'd give it six out of five stars if I could.  Essential. Honestly,I really wait and love all the song inside this album....but unfortunately the shipment got delay almost a month...there is no action or do to get the order came to meRegards,Mahendra They just don't quite make albums like this anymore. The melody's are so beautifully written and the lyrics accompany them so well that when listening to it you just get totally lost in the music. The Stone Roses self-titled debut effort in 1989 is one of the most incredible albums I have ever heard, and I hold music to a fairly high standard. These British musicians have such an amazing sense for smooth, pop-rock that the album gets better and better with every listen. I listen to a lot of hard-rock/alternative/grunge/punk and it is my first love, but I am starting to really love bands like this, that lay down a crystal-clear beautifully written sound that just sweeps you away. Amazing effort by the Stone Roses! I am one of those people who likes music that is not very popular. A lot of people will get turned off by a band just because they have never heard or have never heard anything by them. I suggest that you should listen and  explore your outer reaches of your musical tastes.I think this is one  of those albums. People I now think that just because they have never heard  of the Stone Roses means they were not a good band. This is a awesome band  and yes they were not ever really in the mainstream but at least they have  musical talent. This is one of my favorite albums. I like almost every song  on it it.So to the people who do not like the Stone Roses because they  have never heard of them I say you do not know what you are missing. What can I say that hasn't been said? This record defines the Madchester scene. I can listen to it over and over again, without getting tired of it. You can hear this records influence in a ton of records from the past couple of decades and even today. Not wanting to drink the kool-aid or join a club, this popular album nonetheless blew me away and still does. Rich aural washes, amazing guitar riffs, gorgeous hooks, melodies, lyrics & beats that never get tiresome. At first I would only lsiten to the ten minute epic 'Fools Gold' but slowly noticed that every single song got the same attention and level of production. If you ask me to write about movies, long limber analysis flows, but in the presence of a great music, I'm kind of dumbstruck.I'm with the majority. This is astonishing, joyous, living, ravishing, layered music. Finest CD ever. I purchased The Stone Roses first album when it was released in 1989, and to this day it continues to prove itself to be the most influential album  in my life. A complete album start to finish. Brilliant. I bought this album when it first came out twenty years ago. Maybe it's nostalgia but I think It's aged quite well. I tried to find a flaw in this album after listening to it so many times but, right now, I can't. I'd say Don't stop is the weakest track but even then, it's not too bad a cut. The US version is inifinitely better than the UK release as it has Fools Gold (and the full version no less) included on it.The Roses withered and died not long after this album, One Love being their last decent effort until 1994's Love Spreads single brought them back to life for a short period anyway.I was there on Glasgow Green in June 1990 to see them perform in a big top. The sound and acoustics were horrendous, the spectacle awesome. A definite inclusion in the top ten albums of all time. I listened to this album without any preconceptions.  I checked it out of the library knowning very little about the band.  I never heard of any of the songs. The first half of the CD sounded amateurish to me.  The vocals are difficult to hear through the drone of instruments. It sounds like a band running through its playlist without investing any feeling into it.  The second half gets better.  The songs are more interesting.  To me, ""Made of Stone"" stands out as a good song. ""I am the Resurrection"" has hints of creativity and life (at the end).  ""Fool's Gold"" seems more polished or professional and is good but it's 3 minutes too long. Most of the drumming is second rate.  The lyrics (much of which I had to look up because of the ""muddied"" production) are average at best. Vocals are mediocre.  Guitar playing is inconsistent--flashes of some good playing.After listening to it, I went on line only to find out this CD is supposed to be one of the best Brit CD's of all time.  Never mind all those Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Who, Yes, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, etc. albums that are packed with all those unforgettable songs.  This is it. A CD with forgettable songs, no great lyrics, no great riffs, no great solos (to be fair, ""I am the Resurrection"" has some good stuff at the end if you can suffer through the first half of it with its insipid lyrics and awful drumming).  Really, you want to compare this with the ""White Album"" or ""Exile on Main Street"" or even with the best Oasis albums (another overrated band -- but at least they could compose a song that had some emotional impact)?  If this CD sparked a musical revolution, it certainly had to be by some cosmic fluke.  This is not Zappa's ""Freak Out"" or Brian Wilson's ""Pet Sounds"" -- you won't find anything that ground-breaking here or anything that comes close to that level of creativity.There is a reason you don't hear these songs anywhere (someone is going to tell me they heard ""Fools Gold"" somewhere)-- they are not that extraordinary.  I could name hundreds of better Brit albums off the top of my head. Albums with lots of remarkable and great songs being played by truly great and creative musicians -- who, as a result, become well-known with successful careers.I guess I am missing something?  Maybe 1989 was just a really bad year for music, particularly British music?I would recommend just about any Sonic Youth album instead (despite their being American, they were really innovative).  But, apparently, I am in a very small minority. Despite the many well-deserved glowing reviews, it's hard to praise this album enough.  Suffice it to say that calling it one of the greatest debut albums does it a disservice, because I would put it right up there with the best of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and The Who -- that's how good I think it is.The first song, ""I Want to be Adored,"" puts the listener on notice that the Stone Roses are a special band.  From that curious industrial sound prior to the music kicking in, to that spooky bass-line and guitar phrase, to those sparse and memorable lyrics, (""I don't need to sell my soul, he's already in me -- I want to be adored"") it's just a great song, though, in its darkness, departs from most of the rest of the album.  With the more typical and exhilarating ""She Bangs the Drums,"" one really gets a sense of the unique guitar stylings of John Squire, and the often-imitated smooth voice of Ian Brown (compare the drum intro to Springsteen's ""In Candy's Room"").  ""Elephant Stone"" shows off the subtle intrumentation of Mani and Remi, both masters at their craft, on the bass and drums repectively.  One also learns how Squire can easily switch from a leading role to a more communal one.  In ""Waterfall,"" Squire's repetitive phrases perfectly compliment the harmony driven vocals of Ian Brown with himself, and with Reni in the background.  It's easily one of the band's best songs.Following ""Waterfall"" there is, to me, a bit of a lull in the album.  Not that I don't like the next three songs, it's just that they don't quite match the quality of the rest.  Still, ""Don't Stop"" is a curiosity, where a part of the preceding ""Waterfall"" is played backwards.  ""Bye Bye Badman"" highlights the distinct stylings of Mani and Reni, who might be as good a rhythm section as Clayton/Mullin of U2.  For those who think that the melody of ""Elizabeth My Dear,"" is stolen from Simon and Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair,"" please go back and check your sources.  In fact, both songs use a melody credited as ""traditional"" (same as Traffic's ""John Barleycorn,"" or the Grateful Dead's ""Going Down the Road"").The greatness of the album starts anew with ""Sugar Spun Sister,"" which to me sounds slightly like the theme to the movie ""Chariots of Fire"" by Vangelis.  The chorus (""until the sky turns green and the grass turns several shades of blue"") consists of one of the most dramatic up-lifting parts of the album.  Just as good, and almost its companion song, is ""Made of Stone,"" probably the most ""hit"" oriented track.  Next, with ""Shoot You Down,"" the subtle Mani/Reni rhythm section shines through.If the album had ended with ""Shoot You Down,"" as they say during a Passover Seder, it would have been sufficient.  But the Stone Roses saved the best for last.  The power of Squire's guitar in ""This Is the One,"" after a mellow introduction, is incredible.  But he's just getting started.  Any 8 minute song called ""I am the Resurrection,"" better be good.  In fact it's nothing short of fantastic, with Squire pulling out all of his tricks.  Brown's vocals stand out, as do some of the lyrics (i.e. ""Your tongue is far too long/I don't like the way it sucks and slurps upon my every word."").  The Squire/Mani/Reni jam that makes up the second half of this song might be my very favorite part of the album.  ""Fool's Gold"" is pure funk, and it turns out the band excels with this type of music as well.I don't know how a new band could have the talent and inspiration to do an album like this right out of the shoot (some of their earlier singles were quite good, but not at this level). Soon after the band released this album, there were British clubs that played only Stone Roses music.  In the 90's, a British poll of greatest albums rated this album second only to ""Sgt. Pepper.""  This album (together with My Bloody Valentine's ""Loveless"") inspired so many subsequent bands and albums that one could write a book about just that.  The Stone Roses debut albums remains, after over 15 years, one of the ten albums I would bring to a desert island, and I guess that's the best way to sum up this, admittedly, overlengthy review.Footnote:  These are the ten rock albums I would bring to that proverbial desert island (in no particular order):1. Stone Roses2. Who's Next - The Who3. Born to Run - Springsteen4. The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway - Genesis5. In the Court of the Crimson King - King Crimson6. Disintegration - The Cure7. To Our Children's Children's Children - Moody Blues8. Beggar's Banquet - The Rolling Stones9. Loveless - My Bloody Valentine10.Joshua Tree - U2If I could sneak on three more:1. Nowhere - Ride2. Ferment - Catherine Wheel3. O.K. Computer - Radiohead. Of all the &quot;Madchester&quot; bands the Stone Roses were simply the best. Not only that, they affected Britsh music for years to come:Oasis, Blur, Kula Shaker(just to name a few). I bought this album without even  ever hearing the music, and now if I had to choose one album to take to a  desert island with me, it would be this. The Roses' music is like  Merseybeat from twenty years before, only funkier, and the lyrics  definitely probe some serious psychological depths. Buy this cd, it'll  stick with you forever. The Stone Roses' first album is an undisputed landmark of the pre-BritPop / `Madchester' era - one that would prove enormously influential on the early to mid-90's Britpop bands like Oasis, Blur, etc.  This new remastered edition (2cd's/1DVD) is a very good value for the money (I paid around $20-22), as you get:The debut album itself, which sounds FAR better than the original CD.  The original cd sounded a bit `thin', and this reissue sounds clearer, with more bass, and an overall higher sound level - I A/B'd it on my home system, and the reissue thundered.  The only drawback to the album itself in this package is the omission of `Elephant Stone', which, I found out, was not on the original UK release, but was on the US cd that I have, as a bonus cut.  `Elephant Stone', which is a very good cut, IS on disc 2 of this collection, albeit in demo form, so if you have the original CD (or the Complete Stone Roses cd), don't get rid of them just yet as they have the 'real' versions of the song, which you'll want to have.The 2nd disc is of demos - quality (sonics and artistic) vary a bit, and there's some good material here of both album and non-album songs, so for the hard-core Stone Roses fan, it's an interesting, insightful document.Disc 3 is a DVD containing the August 1989 Blackpool show that is generally acknowledged as a crucial show in their history.  I don't think every song from the show is actually on this (judging by the running time of around 55 minutes and the setlist you can see in shots of Reni's drumkit), but it's very good, and the end raveup (last 10 min of the show) is probably what cemented their reputation.  Film quality is decent - some grain, but more than ok for viewing on a big screen (as I did).  This DVD sealed my satisfaction with the package, as I believe it was only previously available in the US on hard-to-find VHS and import DVD's (I have it on my PAL version of the Complete Stone Roses).  There are also six videos from the era on this DVD, which were also on The Complete Stone Roses.  So versus the Complete Stone Roses import DVD I have, we're basically missing the TV appearances on disc 2 of that set, but for what you get here, it's probably more important to have the Blackpool show.Excellent packaging, nice notes from the principals, with the notable omission of having no comments from John Squire, who doesn't appear to have participated much in this project (Producer John Leckie and Ian Brown supervised the remastering) - apparently, Squire and Brown still aren't seeing eye to eye (putting it mildly), after all these years.  Too bad - it'd have been nice to have some insights/narrative from Squire, who is arguably the best guitarist of that generation.  All in all, though, a nice packaging/remaster of one of the key rock albums of the last 20 years - if you've never owned it, this is a terrific edition to get just for the album itself and the DVD, and if you only have the original edition, this one is a near-revelation. There is no doubt that this disk was the BEST of the 80's! I had it on a LP since 1989 but I couldn't resist to buy this 10th Anniversary Edition and I have to tell you that I am really proud I did it! Most people refer to this album as a synthethis of 60s rock with late 80s/early 90s dance. I'm inclined to disagree. My opinion is that this album merges 60s psych sensibilities with modern effects pedals to produce a trippy, jovial musical experience. ""Elephant Stone,"" ""Shoot You Down"" and most other tracks reveal this infatuation with guitar manipulation technology. The danceyness that's so frequently extolled in reviews is only occassional. The real magic lies in mixing the sound of '67 with the effects available in '89.The technique of the band itself shouldn't be understimated, though. Ian Brown's aloof & cool approach cements the notion that this band is totally sure of itself and it's abilities. The rhythm section is top-notch, and occasionally, downright groovy. John Squire's guitar work is both a throwback to the days of tie-dye and a product of his time's technology. Mesh all of these elements and you've got a superb band playing superb music.Oh, the music! The catchiest songs are interlaced with a fitting production that renders them dream-like (hence the trippyness). Absolutely  wonderful. Save for the brief ""Elizabeth My Dear"" and the backwards exercise of ""Don't Stop,"" each song is a rousing romp through a unique soundscape. The last two pieces are extended forays into a groovyness unseen since the 70s. Excellent.A seminal release from the late 80s, the Stone Roses debut owes plenty to the psychedelia of the 60s but it also stands a testament to the talents of its creators.This is one of those ""Must Have Albums"" that you shouldn't do without. Here's what I suggest, fast forward to 'I Am The Resurrection' and listen to the instrumental part from 3:50 to 8:12. There's a section where after a thick wall of guitar distortion, John Squire then kicks-in with very fast funky riffing. Once I heard this, it was a sheer epiphany, not only is 'I Am The Resurrection one of the greatest songs I ever heard, but it then led me to the rest of the songs where I realized that this is one of the most brilliant albums I've ever had graced my ears. Ian Brown, John Squire, Mani, and Reni. You will never get another band where each member excelled at each of their musical gifts/instruments. Resurrection. Revelation. Powerful. Pure Bliss. The ending of 'I Am The Resurrection' crescendos floating skyward, and how fitting is that...an album that soars far above the rest, a band who's legacy will be remembered, but disappearing into the sunset. The Stone Roses' debut rescued British music and is the diamond that continues to shine, symbolizing that yes, there is still hope. Discover this classic for yourself. This is not a rating of the music. This is and will always be a 5 star album, but the condition of this &#34;new&#34; Sony vinyl deserves 1 star or less if I could give it. The record contained dust all over it after opening. It has lots of surface noise, and this is after having been VPI cleaned twice. This is a pathetic excuse for something in &#34;new&#34; condition. Approach this vinyl with caution. For me, who has been an eager listner for last 25 years, This is THE GREATEST ALBUM in ROCK HISTORY. Beach Boys' Pet Sounds could be arguable, but Stone Roses excels it in many ways. Of course, Beatles made many great albums but none of them tops SR.I even began to trust NME when I saw this album made No. 1 in their ""great rock albums poll"" in 2003.So, no one can say s/he is a genuine rock music listner without fully appreciating this classic. Buy it, period. Pop music simply doesn't get better than this.  The Stones Roses debut album is quite possibly the greatest pop album ever.  I dare you to find a weak point on this album- it's like trying to find a corner in a circular  room.  From the audacious opening line of &quot;You don't have to sell my  soul/ He's already in me&quot; in &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; to the  gentle wash of guitars in &quot;Waterfall&quot; to the out-of-this world  backwards intro on &quot;Don't Stop&quot; to the anthemic sweep in  &quot;This Is the One&quot; to the joyous guitar chatter at the end of  &quot;I Am the Resurrection&quot; to seemingly every other second of this  album, Stone Roses stand as a stunning proclamation of greatness from the  Manchester quartet.  This album is essential for any serious pop music  listener's record collection.  Undeniable perfection!!! No need to write yet another review of THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER MADE. I just have to ask everyone else who bought the 20th Anniversary Vinyl Edition, was there really no insert??? I am very suprised that this seems to be the case. No insert, virtually no information about the band and its history and impact on the back cover or anywhere else, and a completely blank white label on the 7"" Pearl Bastard single. I have also purchased the huge CD/LP Collector's Edition which is magnificent. I am surprised the label (Sony) would skimp on the stand alone vinyl edition. Beware - the 20th anniversary remaster of the sumptuous Stone Roses album does not include the song Elephant Stone.Why is this?Is it because Peter Hook produced it and not John Leckie?Shame on Sony for releasing this without Elephant Stone.And I don't think the sound is all that much different anyway. Yes, the album is hopely overrated by the British music journalists, but the album is great to listen to nevertheless.  The band did not come up with something totally origional here, but their synthesis of several band's music is so wonderful, it's hard to criticize them.  If you are like  me and don't own a copy of Primal Scream's PERFECT pop song, Velocity Girl,  buy this album for the Stone Roses' shameless, but beautiful cover of the  song in &quot;Made of stone&quot;. When the music scene starts becoming stale and boring, along comes an artiste to wipe out the old and herald the new. The Stone Roses were such artistes, arriving at a time when the mainstream was dominated by washed up 80s bands. While I'm a fan of Duran Duran et al, by the late 80s they were crap. Acid house culture was still underground. Along come the Stone Roses, who fused 80s dance sensibilites with 60s pop melodies while still creating something utterly contemporary (for it's time anyway).Starting steadily with I Wanna Be Adored, with it's assured bassline hinting away at a full dance track which comes right at the end, the funked up 10 minute magnum opus Fool's Gold, the Roses' eponymous debut is a classic through and through. Along the way are attacks against the system (Scarborough Fair re-write Elizabeth My Dear, I Am The Resurrection) and what appear to be odes to Ecstasy (pretty much everything else).Ian Brown delivers his lyrics confidently and with poise, John Squire's guitar give the music a certain uplifting power, and the rhythm section...Reni is undoubtedly one of the best drummers in history, and combined with Mani's above average playing create one of the best rhythm sections of all time. On tracks like She Bangs The Drums the hooks blend in effortlessly with the rhythms, creating sounds that one never dreams possible. I've heard the original acoustic version of She Bangs The Drums and it's amazing to hear it's progression. Other standouts for me are Fool's Gold (or Fools Gold as it's printed on my CD), Ressurection, Made of Stone, Elephant Stone, Waterfall...heck the whole CD's great. This is a flawless record. Everything is perfect. Not one song is bad.Did I mention that the music is excellent?","Alternative Rock,Shoegazing,Britpop,Indie Rock,Indie & Lo-Fi,Pop,British Alternative,Adult Alternative,Rock,Dance Pop",since stone roses nominal leaders britains madchester scene indie rock phenomenon fused guitar pop drug fueled rave dance culture rather ironic eponymous debut hints dance made stone roses important welcomed dance pop together treating beast equally important roses cool detached arrogance personified ian browns nonchalant vocals browns effortless malevolence brought life equal sentiments voice wanna adored creeping bassline waves cool guitar hooks doesnt demand adoration expects similarly brown claim resurrection lie back room debate key stone roses john squires layers simple exceedingly catchy hooks rhythm section reni mani always imply dance rhythms without overtly going disco bangs stone roses nominal leaders britains madchester scene indie indie rock rock rock phenomenon phenomenon fused guitar guitar pop pop drug fueled rave rave dance dance culture ironic eponymous debut hints dance stone roses important welcomed dance dance pop pop treating beast equally important roses cool detached arrogance personified ian browns browns nonchalant vocals browns effortless malevolence brought life equal sentiments voice wan adored creeping bassline waves cool guitar hooks demand adoration expects similarly brown claim lie lie back back room room debate key key stone stone roses layers simple exceedingly catchy hooks rhythm rhythm section section reni imply dance dance rhythms rhythms overtly disco bangs
189,394,B0000004V6,"This album is first BDP album that I can't say is a complete classic..however there is classic material on this album (Why Is That, You Must Learn, Who Protects Us From You, Hip Hop Rulez), but I felt that Ghetto Music, and World Peace sound wise were to much of a departure of what came before it. The album doesn't feel as tightly knit as other BDP work..but no question, this is still a highly enjoyable album I recall this being more Jamaican dance hall like than the rest but still very hot.  you will not be disappointed! I have recently introduced myself to the music of KRS-ONE, moreso, re-introduced myself. My wife and I just moved and I was going through some boxes and found one of his earlier albums - the one with, ""Why is That?"", and ""You Must Learn"" on it. In my estimation, KRS-ONE is the BEST RAPPER out there. Not only are his beats and production SLAMMIN'!, his knowledge and message is deeper than the deep blue sea. And for those of you who diss him, and claim that the knowledge he's droppin' is propaganda, I have one question for you: CAN YOU SUFFICIENTLY AND THOROUGHLY DISPROVE AND REFUTE HIM? I pretty much doubt it. May the Edutainment NEVER CEASE! This album is just another great in the career of the Blastmaster Krs One.Put this one in your classic section folks its off the hook.I'm out like Vanilla Ice! Don't believe the hype, this is the best album made by KRS1.  Old school heads (I remember i was a new jack when i first bought this) know what i mean.Buy it if you want a glimpse of what the essence of hip hop is and a nice taste of one of the first professional lyricists. This album still makes ya head nod! I have signed vinyls of this album, ""By all means necessary"", and ""man and his music"". Of course I don't walk around with a turntable so I needed to get the CD. Yeah...I could've did the file share thing and got it for free but it just aint the same. ""Gimme dat"" is definitely the MC anthem. ""The style you haven't done yet"" still makes me appreciate the originallity in the production, ""You must learn"" -classic!I remember being at the Jive listening party and ""Why is that"" came on and my jaw dropped and I was like daaaanng! I was raised in a Christian home and at that time I really wasn't picking up the bible much but KRS had me checking the facts after ""why is that"". This album still knocks and brings back alot of great memories of this era of True Hip Hop. Proud to be from this era yall...It taught me alot of what Hip Hop was truly about. BDP is one of the best. This album shows that. All the songs are good. KRS ONE has made a career with the last two albums, but this one says it all. It actually is The Blueprint. Favorites include Style You Haven't Done Yet, Blueprint, Jack of Spades, Breath Control, Hip Hop Rules,  Bo! Bo! Bo!, and  Ghetto Music. A true Hip Hop Classic. Recommended with the rest of their albums. This is where KRS-One starts to fall prey to didacticism, but he has relevant points to make, and the rapping is surprisingly nimble given all the information he's trying to pack in. ""Who Protects Us from You?"" is a bouncy anti-police-brutality rap, and KRS closes the album with the point that ""World Peace"" can only be achieved through a pragmatic, aggressive struggle for equality. Although Ghetto Music has a few signs that KRS is starting to take himself a little too seriously, overall it's another excellent effort and the last truly great BDP album. BDP threw a sweet curve with this classic. A great album all the way thru. I think this was the last Album where everything from top to bottom was just great and fresh creatively done. I like the other that followed especially sex and violence but this was the last classic to me of BDP. Interestingly enough this album featured his then sister in law Harmony who went on to do a solo album featuring Pound Cake do yall remember that? and of course his then wife now ex Ms. Melody i actually liked Ms. Melody's flow He did a great job with her i especially love the record she did called Live on Stage. What i am saying is this album spun off some great creativity.(period) Now let me go check for some old Ice-T classics. KRS-ONE has now proven for 20+ years that he knows how to make great, timeless, and flawless music. This ""Ghetto Music: The Blueprint Of Hip-Hop"" album which dropped in '89 is no exception to the high standards of a legendary career, you just can't go wrong with songs like ""The Blueprint"", ""Jack Of Spades"", ""You Must Learn"", ""Hip Hop Rules"", and ""Ghetto Music"", mcs take note, this is the blueprint. A phrase I've seen a time or two in reference to James Brown and Little Richard suggests that they can be forgiven their egotism because their music lives up to the boasts. That thought came to mind after ingesting this CD from ""The Teacher"" KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions.Those who suggest this disc is musical propaganda are correct. Kris Parker's general message here is that the police are not to be trusted, the educational system is failing to pass on the achievements of black Americans of the past and of African culture, and that sometimes a black man's only friend is his firearm. He uses an intense vocal delivery while musically smooth rhythms take some of the edge off the bitter pill. Reggae flavors turn up often, being most pronounced (ironically enough) on ""Hip Hop Rules"". The group also make time for a nod to the beat box sound in ""Breath Control"".HIGHLIGHTS:The scratched hook of ""Jack of Spades"" is relentless. Ever wonder where the origins of ""throw your hands in the air"" were? Check the rhyme...Parker's sister Pamela ""Harmony"" Scott turns in a nicely soulful vocal on spiritual paean ""Jah Rulez"". (""What can they do?/What can they say?/They can't live without your love/another day..."") ""Who Protects us from You?"" aims at police brutality, questioning whether the quality of protection varies by class. (""It seems that when you walk the ghetto/You walk with your own point of view..."") ""You Must Learn"" indicts the educational establishment's failure to teach about the achievements of forebears like Benjamin Banneker (creator of the almanac) and Granville Woods (inventor of the walkie-talkie). It's not just young blacks who miss out here. (""When one doesn't know about the other one's culture/Ignorance swoops down like a vulture.."") Gangsta rap template ""Bo! Bo! Bo!"" is catchy, if not more than a little disingenuous on a disc that also includes ""World Peace"" and the logo of the ""Stop the Violence"" movement.LOWS:""World Peace"" is simultaneously musically catchy and lyrically vapid. ""If we really want world peace/and we want it right now/We must make up our mind to take it.."" is the answer according to Parker but that doesn't take into account the fact that many world conflicts are based in deep seated religious or ethnic divisions that won't go away just because of ""positivity"".BOTTOM LINE:You have to take some of the ""education"" here with a grain of salt. But there can be no doubt at all about KRS' skill on the mic. He absolutely defines the foundations of old school hip-hop and this album is one of rap's cornerstones. Recommended. Ghetto Music--Released in the summer of 1989, Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip-Hop was the third studio album from Boogie Down Productions.  The music is crisp and thick with rhythm.  Sonically, Ghetto Music is slightly less up-tempo than both Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary.  KRS-One flaunts his reggae influence more than ever with this album, and even incorporates more live instruments on several songs.Standout cuts include ""Jah Rules"" with a nice sung chorus by group member Harmony; ""Jack of Spades"" gives the lowdown on Keenan Ivory Wayans' vigilante hero from I'm Gonna Get You Sucka; ""Why is That"" re-imagines Biblical characters with an Afrocentric view and criticizes America's public education systems; ""Who Protects us from You?"" admonishes police brutality:  ""So do not kick my door down and tie me up while my wife cooks the stew; `cause you were put here to protect us, but who protects us from you?""The most surreal narrative is ""Bo! Bo! Bo!"":  KRS One's lyrics find himself being rousted by police while on his morning jog; the confrontation turns ugly, and before he knows it, he's taking on several cops in a shootout, blacks out, then wakes up in a bookstore that apparently doubles as a headquarters for militants.  ""World Peace"" is a good closer to the album, with KRS advising banner-waving types that they need to be more aggressive if they really want to achieve their goals.  A re-release should include any available bonus material, including the superior remix to ""You Must Learn"". VEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERY UNDERRATED THIS CD IS WORTH EVERY BIT ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION 10 STARS AND OOP CD MUST HAVE THANKS Any BDP cd is an instant classic. KRS-1 is your favorite MC's MC. Learn hip hop from the TEACHER!!! Extremely DOPE!!! in a world overpopulated by fake gangastas, players, thugs, and wannabe rappers krs-one has constantly proven himself time and time again to be one of the greatest MCs of all time I recall seeing him live in 2002 and to this day he is still one of  my favorite performers. I mean were talking about a guy who over the years has literally crushed thousands of MCs and wack crews both here and overseas how many MCs do you know who can claim that. This album is B.D.P. at the top of his game blazing lyrics and beats that are a good 10 years ahead of their time and when you look at other rappers from that timeframe such as kane and Kool Moe Dee without a doubt B.D.P was the best. while not as good as Edutainment this album is still a wonderful introduction for anyone looking to get into BDP or hip hop in general. i may travel the world being in the military but im truly a bronx resperesentive.....my life belongs to the bronx...so it is a must to buy my peoples album specialy krs one...boogie down productions...will always be rocken...im stationed in germany and they are still crazy about &quot;by all means necessary&quot;...i just hope they don't ever change their style....stay the same for scot la rock...no need to be like the others....just be true to the self.  BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTS....MADE MUSIC BETTER YESTERDAY AND TOMORROW THEY WILL CHANGE IT FOR BETTER LISTENING PLEASURES. EVEN FOR THE APPLE BITTERS.....! KRS One and the Boogie Down Production crew is the epitome of late '80s hip-hop. This album combines hardcore beats with social commentary including police brutality, racism, and religious truths. A must buy for all true hip-hop heads. I actually got turned on to this by Michael Stipe of R.e.m. who praised it in Rollin Stone. As a white boy who owned very little hip hop, this album rocked my world and taught me that hip hop could be as socially relevant as punk rock. KRS-1 is the (...) because he criticizes big hip hop stars and their materialistic life. He also raises questions about Biblical figures, challenging their depictions as white people. ""Jack Of Spades"" is incredible all these years later.There's no stupidity on this record. Most commercial hip hop is pretty empty and stupid, so check out this record if you want to see where the ""edutainment"" kicked off. In my opinion, this album has the best beats of any BDP record.  If KRS-1 came with more substance: this would easily be a stellar, 5 star classic album.  Unfortunately, it lacks wittiness and depth from a lyrical perspective.  Maybe not on average, but from KRS-1 you'd expect more.Still, I find myself listening to this CD the most of the entire BDP catalogue, because... it's catchy. ...afrocentricism was a serious crusade for african americans in our attempt to balance the historical insight of this country to be more inclusive to all of the people it represents...a very lofty goal, but once it became an aspect of commercialism within music, it became less of a statement and more of a fad, sad, but true.but for many of us, what krs and others had to say was like life-music...it didnt just challenge white folks, it challenged the fear of white folks among many black folks and also some of our fears with each other...inclusion into the cultures of others shouldnt always equate to the dissolvement of other ones, room must be made for everyone.  every american is important, as are their points of views, but it is ironic that many who cant get down with mr. kris parker have less of a problem with today's deconstructive and meaningless music than they have with his messages of outrage and upliftment......okay, where was i?  oh, yeah...THIS ALBUM IS HOT! ONE OF HIP-HOP'S TOP 20 OF ALL TIME...SHOW SOME LOVE YALL.... This is a straight up banging album; with live instruments throughout, the music is crisp and thick with rhythm.Standout cuts:  Jah Rules; Jack of Spades; Why is That; World Peace; Who Protects us from You?Bandleader  KRS-One flaunts his reggae influence more than ever with this album.  Definitely worth picking up, especially those seeking an  &quot;alternative&quot; to wackness...  Long live the Blastmaster! krs challenged religion, my man at first listen this cd would make you dislike it after anothewr listen it grows on you, why is that is stil dope includes jack of spades another rap classic, not a bad cd if you like that old school new york flava you know what to do. I'm a BDP fan and I defeintely wanted to add this to my collection. BDP is the number 1 set and sound BDP was simply too didactic to ever be very popular. KRS1 was not called `teacher' for nothing. Sadly, what he taught was mostly propaganda, based not on a scholarly assessment of his subjects, but on a quasi-religious belief in his own rhetoric. The beats were OK though, and `Bo Bo Bo' was fun, and relatively free of preaching. So says Nas. KRS went from being a hiphop B-Boy to straight teacher and preacher on Blueprint. I remember when this joint dropped in the summer of 89. It was too preachy for a summer record and not as dope or ground breaking as his hit Self Destruction or PE's Nation of Millions.Top Joints:Why Is That?Jack Of SpadesYou Must Learn","Pop Rap,Pop,Old School,Rap & Hip-Hop,Gangsta & Hardcore,East Coast",first bdp cant say complete classic however classic material must learn protects us hip hop rulez felt ghetto world peace sound wise much departure came doesnt feel tightly knit bdp work question still highly enjoyable recall jamaican dance hall like rest still hot disappointed recently introduced krs one moreso introduced wife moved going boxes found one earlier one must learn estimation krs one best rapper beats production slammin knowledge message deeper deep blue sea diss claim knowledge hes droppin propaganda say complete classic classic classic material material learn protects hip hip hop hop felt ghetto world world peace peace sound wise departure came feel tightly knit work question highly enjoyable recall jamaican dance dance hall hall rest hot disappointed recently introduced krs krs one introduced wife boxes found earlier learn estimation krs krs one best rapper beats production knowledge message deep blue blue sea sea diss claim knowledge propaganda
190,395,B0000004VK,"Musically Billy Ocean had a career spanning back to the mid 70's that covered a very captivating and diverse creative ground. With his good looks,obviously well tailored appearance and strong,distinctive singing and songwriting the man was poised to be a huge presence on the pop charts. But up until this time only the albumNights (Feel Like Getting Down),his debit album for Epic Records really made a huge impact at least on the dance side. When it came to this,his debut on Jive records things started to turn around for him at this particular respect. Considering his sound was always in the pop arena but never exactly what you'd call out and out commercial,it was a bit surprising that this big splashy hit parade intended to be highly commercial still has such musical value.""Caribbean Queen"" was Ocean's breakthrough number,a slinky grooving dance/funk classic that is among my favorite such tracks of the year. ""Mystery Lady"",""Syncopation"" and ""Lucky Man"" are deep,slow grooving and slick funky numbers with some bubbly bass/guitar licks and keep that flavor going strong. The two ballads here,the Beatles ""The Long And Winding Road"" and the title song are both very passionate really and I especially like the way Oceans turns the harmonies of the vocals around on the Beatle cover. ""Loverboy"" is really a unique cut,a mixture of 80's hard guitar rock and synth bass type funk that surprised me in terms of the songs that become hits. ""Dancefloor"" and ""If I Should Lose You"" seem to be dated to some people musically but they provide a wonderful example of the boogie funk sound still going strong at the time.On this album Billy Ocean managed to get that big hit album that tended to be needed for mass popularity in the 80's without compromising the integrity of his sound very much. The music is primarility based in uptempo material,which is rather unconventional for the time. To make it even better that uptempo music is funk at it's roots. And the bass,guitar and rhythm are as emphasized as the singer on that end of it. The electronics used are done so sparingly and go along well the songs. It doesn't sound anything like Billy Oceans previous two albums for Epic. But despite how often some of these hits are played,it didn't really sell out his soul. A good example of an artist being themselves as they achieve well deserved popular acclaim. Here is the beginning of Billy Ocean's consecutive hit-making. Four hits from this album include the title track,LOVERBOY,CARIBBEAN QUEEN(NO MORE LOVE ON THE RUN) and MYSTERY LADY. Another memorable song is a cover of the Beatles' recording THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD. Before Ocean,Peter Frampton covered the hit for the 1978 movie soundtrack SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND. The other songs are great. HEARD ""SUDDENLY"" RECENTLY AND WAS SENT BACK IN TIME WITH MEMORIES OF 30 YEARS AGO.  STILL LOVE THIS MUSIC! Totally happy with my purchase. This CD has good quality. Brings back memorys I enjoy. Billy Ocean fused R&amp;B/soul with pop/rock and ended up with an excellent album. &quot;Carribean Queen&quot; and &quot;Loverboy&quot; are both must-have 80's hits, and this album is the best place to hear them, because the versions here are much longer than the radio edits on his greatest hits CD! But then again, every song on this album is great, and the heartfelt cover of the Beatles' &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; should win over people who don't normally appreciate 80's music. But if you are a fan of the 80's, you definitely need this album, and if you aren't, get it anyway! Truth be known, I'd probably keep this over his ""Hits"" disc. I say that because three of his absolute best songs are here in their original form, and some of his other hits border on cheese. Plus there's other good stuff here too. ""Caribbean Queen (no more love on the run)"" was a huge hit, as was the ballad ""Suddenly"", and I think my favorite is easily ""Loverboy"". Plus this has the minor hit ""Mystery Lady"", and a decent cover of ""The Long And Winding Road"". That's over half the album, and the remaining four songs I'd call good filler. Any fan of 80's pop/soul should consider this a must own. That trademark funky urban and danceable soul of the 80's seemed to flourish starting around 1983 and into `84-85. You know what I'm talking about; The Pointer Sisters, Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston, Ready For The World....it goes on and on. One of the forerunners of this magnificent genre of music in the 80's was none other than Caribbean-born Billy Ocean. One listen to that voice and you know who it is. He kind of sings with a deep richness like when you say ""Ah"" when the doctor is looking into your throat. I mean he really brings up the vocals from deep down. And yet he can reach the higher notes. His voice is so flexible and flawless and grooves along with every song, never missing a beat.  In 1984, Billy came out with a remarkable album in ""Suddenly,"" one of those albums that is a staple of the early 80's genre of funky urban and danceable soul. It is nostalgic, yet very timeless in my opinion and it takes me back to when times were a little less stressful.""Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)"" - This is my favorite song from the album and hit the Billboard top 10 of 1984. Check out the groovy bass and jazzy saxophone! And those cute repetitive keyboard notes with the funky foot stomping beat are pretty darn cool! Oh yeah, and the sound effects to go with the lyrics are fun to listen to. There is magnificent orchestration here and the song is overall urban funky melodic fun. Billy's vocals are passionate with an urgency. This Caribbean queen has him losing his cool.""Mystery Lady"" - This is just your basic urban R&B; funky song. It's very catchy and Billy's notes are flawless. The keyboards are cool and the harmonizing is fun. I love this song. Kick back and bop your head and let your mind drift.""Syncopation"" - Slowing it up a little, Billy gives us a smooth funky beat to chill out with. Billy sings of missing the ""syncopation"" he had with a certain woman who was having an affair.""The Long And Winding Road"" - Smooth, graceful and soft. Billy's rich vocals amongst easy-going melodies provide the perfect opportunity for a slow dance.""Loverboy"" - I absolutely love this song. The beat is like a funk-dance urban R&B; disco-like groove. You cannot help but move on this song. Billy's vocals are soaring amongst the edgy, melodic guitars that keep the time just right. The synths/keyboards mirror the urgency that Billy is singing about; the intense need to be someone's love. This is one of the most addicting songs on the album. Is it any wonder that this song reached the Billboard top ten of 1985?""Lucky Man"" - Cute, catchy song featuring some nice piano, synths and a funky beat. Billy sings of being lucky to have the woman he has. Nothing too special about this song.""Dancefloor"" - True, this is a danceable song. Cool synths and that hand-slapping beat. Just a nice easy-going song. Nothing huge.""If I Should Lose You"" - Another easy-going song; and smooth with atmospheric and melodic keyboarding. Billy grooves along with his vocals as usual.""Suddenly"" - This is probably one of Billy's trademark love songs; beautiful and free-flowing. Billy's vocals are so silky and magnificent. It's a song about how life has new meaning once you find that love you've been looking for. It's just romantic and perfect for that special occasion.Okay, so you know what to do now. Plunge into the ""ocean"" and get the goods! You won't be disappointed. Billy Ocean delivered here and showed the world that he was out there and already performing, the stars aligned for this offering and what a powerhouse...my album for my time in Africa in the 80s. This was on TV all the time to promote Carribean Queen as an 80s classic. I had never heard the song in its entirety, and it clocked in at just above 7 minutes long. Loverboy and Suddenly are also good songs, but not enough for me to rate it higher than a disappointment with the artist as a whole. This is another one of those Cds I found at Wal Mart for 5 bucks. I guess they're still trying to make their money back from the first press. Didn't even include credits, and no lyrics in the package. After recording several critically acclaimed albums for the GTO and Epic labels that did not exactly set the world on fire, Billy Ocean signed with Jive Records and hooked up with producer Keith Diamond who masterminded this classic 1984 release that made Billy Ocean a true superstar. The uptempo dance numbers &#34;Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)&#34;, &#34;Lover Boy&#34; and &#34;Mystery Lady&#34; all became huge hits but the title track was and is one of the most gorgeous ballads of its time and one which you can still regularly hear on adult contemporary stations throughout the country. Loved it.  I put it on my MP3 player and I enjoy this in the morning at the gym. Wish I knew of more of Billy Ocean's music. Billy Ocean burst on the pop scene with this album in '84, although he had a hit with 'Nights (Feel like Getting Down)' a few years before.  An excellent voice with modern (80's) pop rhythms made for a very danceable and pleasureable listen then.  Standouts are 'Caribbean Queen'(the Extended version almost 8 minutes!), 'Loverboy'(contains the longer intro than on the radio version), and the ballad 'Suddenly'(one of the best love songs of the era).  Also, contains a good remake of the Beatles swan song 'The Long and Winding Road'.Good intro for those getting familiar with the 80's sound.  And great memories for us that were there then.  Enjoy.Thats My-2-Cents. SuddenlyI am just one of a big fan of music, who won't let that masterpieces like this one ever got forgotten. BACK IN THE 80'S........I WAS ON VACATION ON THE ISLAND OF JAMAICA IN THE BEAUTIFUL CARIBBEAN......I WAS STAYING AT WONDERFUL HOTEL....AND ONE NIGHT THEY INTRODUCED THIS VERY TALENTED YOUNG MAN THAT WAS UNKNOWN AT THE TIME NAMED BILLY OCEAN........WELL HIS VOICE AND TALENT FILLED THE ROOM...........IN THAT CLUB THAT NIGHT......AND WHEN HE SANG THE HAUNTING LYRICS TO CARIBBEAN QUEEN..........THE PLACE WENT BONKERS......WELL BILLY OCEAN WAS OFF TO STARDOM.......WHAT A TALENT...!!I'M GLAD THAT I HAD A OPPERTUNITY TO MEET THIS FINE YOUNG MAN AT THAT TIME........AND TO ENJOY HIS FINE MUSIC ON THIS CD......WILL ALWAYS BE A TREASURE......... After peaking at number 22 in 1976 with his first hit ""Love Really Hurts Without You"", Billy Ocean spent the better part of next eight years in near obscurity until he burst back on the scene with the number one hit ""Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)"".  It is an all-time great 80's hit with a slinky dance groove. It was followed up by ""Loverboy"" which was written by rock producer Mutt Lange and topped out at number two. It has a slick rock guitar crunch over a danceable beat.  The title track is a 180 from the first two tracks as it is a straight, syrupy ballad that soared up to number four on the charts.  The album peaked at number 9 and marked the start of Mr. Ocean's brief run as the one of the biggest singers in the world. I bought this CD for the song, Syncopation.  However, I was very pleased to find that I loved almost every song on the CD.  This CD may be from the 80's but it definitely sounds just as good today. I really really love the cd so so much! I like every songs on every track. I have three that's definitly my favorite in the whole wide world! The first one ""Caribbean Queen"" has every sensual side to it but I don't know that much about that song that is the only thing I know. The second song ""Dancefloor"" makes wanna get out on the dancefloor to groove all night long, it has a lot of energy and it really picks you up out of your seat-it keeps you movin' all night long. The third song, last but not least, ""Suddenly"" it has a magical ring to it when you listen to Billy when he sings and listening to the instruments it's like when you see an orchestra playing it sounds beautifulthat song is very very beautiful. There is an experience to that song is that you start to believe in a impossible dream of a magical moment to reveal the real you of who you are and who you can be is to believe in your dreams and yourself that you really do live with a real fairy tale life-I went through that in the year 1983 when I was 5 years old when I saw the movie ""Cinderella"" the very first time that made me think I wanna be like her a princess, now, I'm 25 years old! Now I know that dreams suddenly do come true all the time it's like when you look at miracle some kind of gift of who you wanna be-that song really means a lot to me but also everbody too as long as our dreams succeeds forever. I recommend this cd to everyone out there who are a big Billy Ocean fan like me. billy ocaen first album classic all the way.love the it.if you are true billy ocean fan you will love this Mine took long enough to get to me (almost two months), but, my word! 'Mystery Lady', 'Syncopation', 'Loverboy'. Put these in heavy rotation and you'll forget it's 2009. I got this to replace another of the same , when I got it the case was broken and the CD skips.

191,397,B0000004VQ,"I am 29 years old and a male.  When I was in about eighth grade or maybe it was seventh, I can't remember anymore, there wasn't much to do in a small town.  All we had were comic books, atari, and WHODINI (thank you lord).  I listen to Metallica, Megadeth, new stuff, I am broad in my music taste.  However, I would put Back in Black by WHODINI on any top 10 list of mine.  I guarentee you that you will love it. The beats and mixes and the rapping on this cd are original and the rhymes are just like WHODINI would call them........explicit!!!!!!!!! First met this group backstage at a concert in 1986 at the newly built UTC Arena, I loved the concert that i had  to order the cd for the rest of my collection. i would purchase more from this company. Harold Harden Chattanooga,TN. i am 32 yr old white male  and not even my 16yr old daughter knows who whodini is  this is good &quot; party&quot; music  trust me!!!!!!!!!1 This is fantastic stuff. I vividly recall cutting this up on the 1200s back in the day... 'Echo Scratch' is awesome! And 'I'm a Ho' is GREAT. ""...How do ya know? because I told ya so!""  All great rap artists write a song like this at some point...  NWA has Strawberry, etc... JALIL, ECSTASY, AND GRANDMASTER DEE YALL ARE FOREVER THE REALEST AND TRUEST.

YOU GUYS WILL FOREVER GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE TOP RAP GROUPS TO EVER EXIST.ONE LOVE YALL, CHYNA IN JERZ. I love, love, love old-school rap and Whodini is one of the reasons.  Many people didn't like this album as much as the one with ""Freaks Come out at Night"" but I did.  From the more popular ""Funky Beat"" to the less known ""Fugitive"" this is an album I can listen to over and over again. It is truly timeless.  I also like that Whodini didn't have to cuss and call women out of their names in order to be effective and entertaining.  They don't get the props other rap acts of the 80s do which is a shame.  Their music is one of the reasons I look back on my teenage years so fondly.  And even if you are skeptical of my words, consider this: my MOM even likes this album--and believe me you couldn't find a woman more against rap music than her :). IT WAS GREAT , A CLASSIC JUST WHAT I WANTED AND WAS LOOKING FOR THANX!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All of their CD are great but I like this one the most. I wish that you all will come out with another one just for old time sakes. Now don't missunderstand the title of this review. RUN DMC did so much for rap that it is immeasurable. But I also feel that Whodini made a huge contribution to the scene as well. Every song on this CD is a classic. Funky Beat, Growing Up and Fugitive are the standouts for me. The guitar in Fugitive was definately a huge selling point for me. As a guitar player I am drawn to songs like this. Back when this came out the concept of guitar solos in rap songs was truly in it's infant stages. With the exception of Rock Box I cannot think of another song that was done in this style. Rapping over smokin guitar tracks. Whodini material is a classic example of what rap started out as. No harsh material, no hatred, nothing offensive. Not that offensive material bothers me, but it is kinda nice to hear the roots of rap. This is classic old-school rap, and a solid album.  You might think that you can simply get away with buying a greatest hits from Whodini, but you'd be wrong.  This CD has at least one very important track that you can't get on the complications:  Good Part. whodini back in black album great.the best rap group out back in today by far.you will love this cd from track one thru track 10.one love..","Pop Rap,Soul,Pop,Old School,R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Blues",years old male eighth grade maybe seventh cant remember anymore wasnt much small town comic books atari whodini thank lord listen metallica megadeth new stuff broad taste however would put back black whodini top list mine guarentee love beats mixes rapping cd original rhymes like whodini would call explicit first met group backstage concert newly built utc arena loved concert order cd rest collection would purchase company harold harden chattanooga tn yr old white male even yr old daughter knows whodini good quot party quot trust fantastic stuff vividly recall cutting back day echo scratch awesome im ho great ya know years old male eighth eighth grade grade maybe seventh remember anymore small town town comic comic books books thank listen metallica new stuff broad taste put back black list mine love beats mixes rapping cd original rhymes call explicit met group backstage concert newly built utc utc arena arena loved concert order cd rest collection purchase company chattanooga tn yr old white white male male yr old daughter knows good quot party quot trust fantastic stuff vividly recall cutting day echo scratch awesome ho great know

MORE SAMPLES THAN EVER,THIS  WON'T ONLY MAKE YOU THINK,IT WILL MAKE YOU DANCE RAPIDLY WHILE THINKING. Schoolly's 4th album seemed to get more exposure than his first 3, and is distinguished by early use of extremely long, largely unaccompanied, samples of well-known material -- not that this hadn't happened at all before, but Schoolly's pushing the envelope here. (His next album ""How A Black Man Feels"" has pages of legal clearance info on the samples -- perhaps there was trouble.) It's a neat demonstration of the DJ's art, and if long samples don't irritate you (or if you've never heard Hendrix, Richard Pryor & many others before), it's okay.As a rap album, it's just okay.After ""Smoke Some Kill"" (1988), Schoolly's self-hyped Bad Negro image had become clowny. On this album he wants to be taken a bit more seriously, adding a bit of black power & drugs-f***-you-up-kidz social responsiblity. These insights aren't deep, but they seem like sincere expressions of home truths for the rap-as-CNN youth audience. For me, the white rock n roller, Schoolly was a lot more credible (and effective) insulting white rock n rollers. Rhythmicly the album is catchy but not compelling.Good, but not something I'd trot out to impress the neophite.Hear these first:* The Last Poets first two albums, recently reissued, are an unrelenting and deeply felt expression of sentiments Schoolly touches upon here, and they make Schoolly sound kid-safe by comparison.* Schoolly's self-titled debut album, dearly needing re-issue One of my favorite Rappers of all time.

193,399,B0000004WA,"ATACQ are one of the most underrated artists over here in Australia. The only cuts of theirs that ever get played on TV are &quot;Can I Kick It&quot; and some of their stuff from their last album. This album really proves that they were among the best groups of the early 90s.The opening track &quot;Push It Along&quot; really sets the mood for the rest of the album. Q-Tip's flow is understated to say the least and he's able to drop in some of the most incredible lines of poetry at any time. The track may be a bit down-tempo (this is jazz-rap we're talking about though) but by the end of it, most listeners will be calling out the chorus.&quot;Luck Of Lucien&quot; is another classic. The lyrics are moulded to the beat in a way that only the top MCs can do and the entire storyline - yes, it is a story - is superbly done.The other standouts here are &quot;Bonita Applebum&quot; (which of course provided the Fugees with the guitar thing for &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;), &quot;I Left My Wallet In El Segundo&quot; (possibly one of the funniest stories ever committed to album) and &quot;Can I Kick It&quot;.&quot;Can I Kick It&quot; allays any doubts that the listener might have that they're listening to two of the best MCs going around. Both Phife and Tip deliver stellar verses with some of the best rhymes around.There seems to be no way to fault this album - possibly it might pale into comparison with &quot;Low End Theory&quot;, but I haven't bought that one yet. So far, well worth whatever you have to pay for it. This album is one of the greatest rap albums of all time. Any fan of tribe or 90s rap will enjoy playing this album. thee cd came in BRAND NEW still in the plastic! 5/5 service If u somehow have never come across this gem, pick it up now...THe is not just an amazing hip hop album, its a classic album regardless of genre....There are so many classic hits like ""can i kick it?"" , ""bonita applebaum"", ""footprints"" ""i left my wallet in el segundo""....My personal fav is ""Rythm"" and ""bonita applebaum"".....Do yourself a favor and pick up this hip hop classic I can honestly say that when I first heard A tribe Called Quest, I was very young. (I was eight years old when their debut album came out, I am now 24). Their feel good lyrics, and interesting videos made me a fan, a lifelong fan. I especially like Bonita Applebum. Although I was too young to understand what that song means, I do now. There should be more groups like A Tribe Called Quest. They also need their induction in VH1 Hip Hop Honors. Positive rap needs to be celebrated. Yeah so if anyone wants to start listening to some real beats and rhymes, check out the Tribe. This stuff is the real deal. The boys representing the NYC put it down like no other crew out there. This cd is their first and possibly their best effort as a group. The whole disc is just loaded with ridiculously fun samples and adlibs that just knocked me off my feet. After the band broke up, Tip put out a pretty good solo record(Amplified), Phife put out a not so good solo record(the name escapes me), and Malik joined an average R&amp;B group(Lucy Pearl). Why they split up, I will never know. ...Not by the album, that goes without saying.I'm astounded that some of you guys are reviewing this LP after only just buyin' it here in 2005!The reason I say this is not to trainspot and all like i've been listening to this since the day it came out (but pretty close too) BUT, to make a point for people who are not yet fans.You guys (fellow reviewers/fans brand new and older than me) are ""buggin' out"" on The Tribe in 2005 just like so many other fans of the real ish, and it doesn't matter when we first heard but, that we DID, are still, and will forever. Man, I will prob have one of their joints bumpin' at my funeral!My point is, that this LP and particularly their next two can and probably will never be beat!! Sh**, their tunes will still sound dope in 3005 in some space capsule retro i-pod.So, anyone that is yet to hear the superlative music of A Tribe Called Quest, buy this LP for starters...today(!), ""Low End Theory"" tomorrow and ""Midnight Marauders"" as well.Just buy it all, I need to go to the bathroom. Great album from top to bottom.  Excellent vibe, and great album to listen to during the summertime.  Tracks 3,4, and 9 are my favorites. A quest into the past with debut album People's Instinctive Travels And The Paths Of Rhythm pivitol introduction of peaceful journey for A Tribe Called Quest.  Leading this album off with an infant crying shows the group's state.  ""Push It Along"" contains a perfect guitar section smoothed out by a saxophone bridge.  Speeding up the pace on ""Luck Of Lucien"" incorporating a slick horn sample to accent the storyline.  Tackling social issues and everday life or its nights on ""After Hours"" narrated by Q-Tip with awareness of his surroundings.  Sampling a 70's groove over a break beat, ""Footprints"" contains a simple horn section to complete the track.  On another excursion ""I Left My Wallet In El Segundo"" underlined by a Spanish theme follows the album's descriptive goal.  ""Pubic Enemy"" is more or less a public announcement of unsafe sex and the reality of disease without protection.  A classic all its own, ""Bonita Applebum"" is the highlight of this album with its original score and rhyme pattern of nearly a love song or poetry.  Questioning ""Can I Kick It?"" was answered in in two verses that could have been simply said, yes!  ""Youthful Expression"" is an upbeat tune with a groovy guitar sample and organ keys contributed to the flow with lyrical contents ""...Phife, Jarobi, Ali / told me / get the force like Wan Kanobi...""  Keeping the rhythmatic tracks on beat, the song ""Rhythm (Devoted To The Art Of Moving Butts)"" zero in on its attempt to keep you in tuned with this head nodder.  Giving props to the rhythm provider, producer and DJ, ""Mr. Muhammad"", the spotlight was actually taken by one of the few appearances of Phife.  ""Go Ahead In The Rain"" takes the feel of roller rink days skating somehow, but stays on track with the overall feel of the album's concept.  Concluding this fourteen track album with ""Description Of A Fool"" is another fairytale that is all so non-fictional.  All of the titles included captured both the travels and the rhythm of the LP's title with a variety within its circumference.  This Quest was brought to you by Q-Tip, Phife, Ali Shaheed Muhammad & Jarobi uniting to form a Tribe. This right here was the beginning of the phenomonal group A Tribe Called Quest. Their 1990 debut ""People's Instinctive Travels And The Paths Of Rhythm"", a 5 mic classic from The Source (back when those things were accurate). And with this album, you have no option but to love this music, as the chemistry between Q-Tip, Phife, Ali, and Jarobi. Lyrically, no one could touch these guys, especially Tip who rhymes on the majority of this album. A lot of these songs were just fun to listen to, like their big hits ""I Left My Wallet In El Segundo"", and ""Bonita Applebum"". A few party tracks on this album (going by 1990 standards) like ""Ham & Eggs"" and ""Can I Kick It?"" (wonderful song). Production was good too, with a little taste of jazzy flavor that anyone could enjoy.As for anything bad, I doubt there are any. A personal gripe is that I didn't like the way ""Description Of A Fool"" closed out the album, but that just my preference. It's still a good song though.What else can be said? If anyone told you this was an awesome CD, you heard correct. This is the kind of hip hop music that makes me remenise when it was all about having fun and not the way it is here in 2007. If you're looking for an essential hip hop album, I recommend this to you as well as their next two albums. Heck, all the Tribe albums range from good to classic status (even ""The Love Movement""), and all should be heard.Lyrics: A+Production: A+Guest Appearances: N/AMusical Vibes: A+Favorite Tracks: All Are My Favorites and should be heardPeace! This is not as good as The Low End Theory because it does not have that level of originality as there 2nd throught even 4th album had but it is just as good as Midnight Marauders and that is a very solid 5 Mics and so is this. The albums main portion is the raps by Q-Tip it was dissapointing not to here Phife Dawg to much. The beats are almost flawless. The album takes from it what 3 Feet High and Rising did and they bring in the Jazz element. The music is increddible and many of these songs are classics like ""I left my wallet in el segundo"" to the pure smoothness of ""Bonita Applebum"" by the time applebum was released I am sure everyone knew these guys would be huge.""Can I kick it"" is a earlier Award Tour and it is a sing along and there are songs to dance to like ""Rhythym the Art of Moving Butts"" and then there is another classic song in ""Ham & Eggs"" which tells the danger of eating them but yet is a party.The album of course has efinant replay value to make it a enjoying listen. This is the third Tribe album to get after you picked up The Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders This was a good album. Not a great one, but a good one. The potential is there. Tracks like &quot;Can I kick it?&quot; and &quot;Bonita Applebum&quot; are timeless, no one denies that. But that's it. The rest of the album gets lost and falls short of being a true classic. It doesn't hold up overtime. And where's Phife? He's on maybe four or five tracks, thus very little back-and-forth play between him and Tip. A good effort, but not the classic it's made out to be. That would come later. This album is a definetly a timeless classic. Even up to this day I pump it in my stereo! They don't make rap music like that anymore. 'TRIBE' possessed a talent and an ability that very few rap artists have.Today,  hip-hop can sometimes sound monotonous, but on this album 'instintive  tavels' they showed the world that it's alright to be different;it's  alright to'be off the beaten path'. When you listen to songs like  'FOOTPRINTS' and 'DESCRIPTION OF A FOOL' you can hear that they were  educating the urban youths of that time (especially black youths as I was  at the time) to love and stick by each other;to be proud; not to be  engrossed in violence toward each other like so many of young black people  today are in. This album is not just for black youths, it's for anyone who  loves pure, unadulterated hip-hop, with a twist. That 'twist' is something  that can't be explained, it's something they've mastered. Something they've  unknowingly mastered.It's a talent they were born with. This album has an  innocence and humor such as on the track 'BONITA APPLEBUM'in which the  artist Q-TIP rhymes about escapades with the female persuasion,  and yet  there are songs like 'PUBLIC ENEMY'that put us back in check. And who can  forget the classic 'Can I kick it.' I miss these guys! The group is not  together anymore, but they are immortal through this album they left us and  four others that are great as well. Thanx Q-tip, Phife, Ali Shaheed  Muhammad, and Jarobi, for broadening our conciousness, giving us a fly  beats and lyrics with substance and meaning! A Tribe Called Quest's first album is a hip hop classic. This album introduced the world to the sound that was Tribe and introduced us to two of the best mcs ever, Q-Tip and Phife Dawg. A very sampled album this also show the jazzy side of Tribe which would be used more on futher releases. Plus the sample of Lou Reed's Walk on the Wild Side is brillant on Can I Kick It?. Favorites include Push It Along, Luck of Lucien, I Left My Wallet in El Segundo, Bonita Applebum, Can I Kick It?, Ham 'n' Eggs, and Go Ahead in the Rain. Highly Highly Recommended. Man I love the Tribe all there albums are classic Low End  and midnight Maruaders and on and on this is what is missing in hip hop today before the industry got a whole of it before it wasn't even music they said buy this joint you won't be disappointed if you like Little Brother, Slim Village, and the producers producer Jay Dilla pick it up Although this is a great album, don't buy it on vinyl from Amazon.The records aren't pressed properly, so the first few seconds of songs start at the end of sides. In one case, ""Can I Kick It"", you hear the first few seconds of introduction, the talking ""Can I Kick It"" then the record ends, you put on the second record then the rest of the song continues!I've just received my second copy of this from Amazon to replace an earlier version with problems, but it turns out that this isn't just a one off, it is a problem with all pressings that Amazon have.The music's a four or five star, the vinyl pressing is terrible. A Tribe Called Quest's (Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Phife Dawg) debut album ""People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (1990) is an outstanding release. Q-Tip and Phife deliver intelligent rhymes, while Ali Shaheed Muhammad provides impressive production.  The albums opener is the seven-minute ""Push It Along"" a track where the Tribe MC's deliver memorable and insightful rhymes backed a solid production (feeling the Jazz Guitar). ""Luck of Lucien"" flows through well, then Tribe shines again on ""After Hours"", love the scratching and lyrics to this cut. The smooth ""Footprints"" and dope ""I Left My Wallet In El Segundo"" follow. The laidback ""Bonita Applebum"" is a beautiful track, which has the Tribe talking to the ladies. ""Can I Kick It"" is a distinctive Hip Hop anthem in itself and Tribe keeps it moving on ""Rhythm (Devoted To The Art Of Moving Butts)"". The tracks that follow are all unique in their own way. When people talk about Tribe they often mention their classics ""The Low End Theory"" and ""Midnight Marauders"", they sometimes forget about the dope album that preceeded those two releases, ""People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm"" is an album to have in the collection. Back a long time ago, hiphop sampled tastefully, to create something new, not make a living off of someone else's work.  This is one of those moments, and every song is absolutely brilliant.  The Low End Theory was a  good follow-up, if a bit obscure, but how anyone can listen to this  gorgeous album full of lovely low-key instrumental moments, and  unforgettable moods, is beyond me.Best cuts are After hours, go ahead in  the rain, description of a fool, foot prints, and mr muhammad (dubby  minimal hiphop, why didnt anyone capitalize on this idea later on?)It's  true that their rapping skills weren't yet solidified (they've gotten  better with each release), but the music was never near as fresh and funky  as it was here.  Blame it on the sample-lawsuit age coming hot on the heels  of their second album, but like they said about the beastie's 'paul's  boutique', this kind of album simply can't be made anymore.A shame too,  because it's possibly the best hiphop album ever recorded... Not to buy this album.  Do you remember the first time you discovered something no one else in your group of friends had heard of, and it was so damn cool you didn't care if they liked it or not?  This is that album.  You may be ten years after the fact but it's still the coolest, most positively funked-out laid back super-cool hip-hop album out there.  Be sure and wipe your feet really good on the rythm rug before each play. While this has some great tracks and tunes, I don't think it stands nearly in the same realm as The Low End Theory or Midnight Marauders. A few classic tunes, but lots a filler...Better than The Love Movement or Q-tip's solo ish. That don't mean much. People's Instinctive Travels is one of those hip hop albums meant solely for having a good time. Made in the age where the gangsta rap of NWA or Ice Cube dominated, People's Instinctive Trabels and the Paths of Rhythm was very much opposite of that. Easygoing and fun, Tribe Called Quest releases a great first debut. With Q-Tip rapping on most of the album(Phife appears on a few tracks, Can I Kick It etc.), the beats fit and the lyrics are great. While they may not be the best of Quest's works, People's Instinctive Travels should NOT be overlooked. The creativity of content is bursting, such as the great travel story of I Left My Wallet in El Segundo, in which Q-Tip and the gang make a trip to El Segundo(a city in California) and he forgets his wallet there. Creative concepts such as Ham'N'Eggs(I don't eat no ham 'n' eggs cause they're high in cholesterol) only add to the hilarity of the album. Made in the same formula as De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising, People's Instinctive Travels and Paths of Rhythm is a fun, easy going, hanging out album that marked the Tribe's debut, and still remains relevant today. Music speaks for itself as any ATCQ knows. I'd take advantage of the cheap discount if you still like CDs like I do. Shipping and delivery fine and in good condition. This album is groovy and playfully great.1.Push it Along2.Luck of Lucien3.After Hours4.Footprints5.I Left My Wallet in El Segundo6.Pubic Enemy7.Bonita Applebum8.Can I Kick It?9.Youthful Expression10.Rhythm (Devoted to the ART OF Moving Butts)11.Mister Muhammad12.Ham 'n' Eggs13.Go Ahead the Head14.Description of a FoolI rated 5 points out of 5! The album is laid back style and the groove what can i say. Jarobi, he's the only member make a great interludes but one thing is he was missing from the later Tribe albums like The Low End Theroy. Why did he left before Low End Theroy arrived? Only video i saw from their first album was ""Can I Kick It"". The video introduces me to the video along with The Low End Theroy and and so on. I love the entire album including ""Ham 'n' Eggs, that song was a real good time. I've heard the crew since October 1990 when I was 5 before the following month (November) I turn 6 years old One thing interest me was the The Low End Threoy because their Paths of Rhythm album where they had dashikis, afrocentric styles, hippy clothes just like De La Soul was wearing. They were looking like nerds and so follow-up changed the chemistry forever. I rated it 5 stars because of Bonita Applebum. Word to the Mother Land, A Tribe Called Quest. Good Work!!! Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Jarobi White, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad: ATCQ all the way! This LP will always be a classic to those who appreciate good Hip Hop.  It's positive messages and unique samplings make it superior.  Tribe is and always will be the greatest Hip Hop group of all time. I love &quot;I Left My Wallet In El Segundo&quot;!  But if you can find the mix verson of &quot;Can I Kick It?&quot; pick it up, because the version that's on this album does not have the same flavor.  Enjoyable, with smooth delivery from Q-Tip and the fellas. Every album &quot;A Tribe Called Quest&quot; released in their career meant something. Like classic musicians of any genre, Q-tip and his crew concentrated on creating an album not a collection of singles. To take any track out of the context of the album is to cheat yourself and the men who created the track. From the beginning to the end, the songs fit together like puzzle pieces; each one is where it belongs and the listener is remiss to skip pass any of them. Don't believe the hype of the latecomers. This is A Tribe Called Quest's best album. Everyone talks about &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; being their best, and yes, it is a great album, but no way quite as innovative and  earth shatteringly new as this one. The production on Travels is even more  remarkable when you realize it is really the first album to touch upon jazz  and seventies soul as the foundation of the groove. It has only an  occassional nod to the stereotype of mixing hip hop with funk samples.It is also their best album because there isn't a dud song on it. The  next two albums by them have numerous duds and filler tracks, not this one.  It sits so well as an album that its almost foolish to recommend individual  songs. Put this album in for some lovemaking...yessuh! This is the album  that convinced me that hip hop was a real art. And is easily one of the  best hip hop albums of all time. I really appreciate that the product came in on time and in the exact condition as described. I wish it would have been to my mailbox instead of my door, but all good. It may be not as consistant as the 2nd and 3rd one but it has standout songs on it I bought it to complete my collection but it is still good Tribe is one of the best hip-hop (and I mean real hip-hop not what passes for it these days) groups of all time.  Great album, what else can I say? After listenin' to this joint like 10 years late like that over reviewer I hear great sounds, beats, rhymes, and rhythm throught this cd. The intro is probably the best I have ever heard, next to &quot;The Roots&quot; &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, but I won't get into that. The production is solid with this being more sample heavy than later efforts, but still there's nuthin' wrong wit dat!Standouts are &quot;Luck of Lucien&quot;, &quot;Ham n' Eggs&quot; (very funny), &quot;Description of A Fool&quot;, &quot;Can I Kick It&quot;, &quot;Fotprints&quot;, &quot;I left My Wallet in El Sugundo&quot;, and then everything else. This is great to listen to for parties, chillin' or whatever! ANd don't skip over ANYTHING! It is always to be listened to as a whole, or at least for the first 5 times ulisten to it. In their freshman album. Tribe IMMEDIATELY breaks up and away from the  status quo of hip-hop.  With jazzy beats and Bill Cosby-esque storytelling  lyrics, Quest showes a new Avenue of our favorite artform while keeping our  heads nodding.  With classics such as 'Bonita Appelbaum' and 'Can I Kick  It?' this CD is a must have for the deep  Tribe follower as well as the  newbie to rap. Review of:People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of RhythmA Tribe Called Quest was the greatest rap group ever assembled. There, I said it. The beats are amazing, the rhymes have depth, and the jazz flow to it all wraps it up nicely. This is their first album, and boy what a debut. With Songs like ""Bonita Applebum"", ""I Left My Wallet in El Segundo"", & ""Can I Kick It?"" it's no wonder they immediately went on to produce their two masterpieces, ""Midnight Marauders"" and ""The Low End Theory"".Onto the product. The CD is well put together, the cover art is cool, and the CD sounds great. No complaints in this area.This album defined what the band was all about; depth, creativity, flow, awesome rhymes, and a jazzy track to rap to.""Can I Kick It? Yes you can."" The jazzy style they adopted was first demonstrated by the Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest just took it to the next level. With their high-in-bass production and stupid lyrics that killed the real (see: Footprints), ATCQ would soon gain the recognition they well deserved. However, there is one fault (a sad one too) and that is Phife. To so many people, it got people wondering if Phife was just Q. Tip's sideman (like Flav was for Chuck-D in Public Enemy), though Phife would soon be promoted to being an MC on Low End Theory.People's... stands as the ""status quo of rap"", its jazzy production will give you reason to get yourself moving. Tip shines more on cuts such as Luck of Lucien and After Hours, where he demonstrates his more constructive side. Both he and Phife just bring down the walls with Can I Kick It, where they kick it to a funky as beat that matches so well with the lyrics. It was somewhat instinctive to most people but needed to lead the path for Phife to being more contributive.Personal favorite= After HoursHonorable mentions= Luck of Lucien, Footprints, Bonita Applebum and Can I Kick It If you like you rap on the cerebral side with a kiss of jazz and deep  grooves, then you can dig this jam. Q-Tip's nasal, light-hearted delivery  works on the bouncy tracks (&quot;Bonita Applebum&quot;, &quot;Can I Kick  It&quot;, &quot;Footprints&quot;, and especially &quot;Luck Of  Lucien&quot;), and Phife is his earthier counterpart. The production is  especially tight for a debut. Will put you in a  mood to dance, chill, or  just kick it!!! If you like Tribe now, you'll enjoy this whimisical  journey. A MUST!!! I just bought this today in Leeds (ya cant find em where I live) and got home and put it in my player from the first track this is a masterpiece, the lyrics are tight and creative, with some tight beats. Q-Tip's rappin' is great with his tight flow and rhymes. It is different to a lot of my albums cause it aint about bustin' caps, smoking blunts and sh-t but is posititve lyrics, there isnt any swearing, but that doesnt make it bad, the lyrics are dope. Anywayz it is a dope CD with the standout tracks ""Can I Kick It?"" ""Description of A Fool"" ""I Left My Wallet In El Segundo"" and ""Luck Of Lucien"" I enjoyed the whole album so buy it if you are into good hip hop and want to hear soemthin good.And thats allI have to say about that this cd is good and entertaining great music if you like a Tribe CalledQuest then you will like People's Instinctive Travels And the Paths of Rhythm i've been listening to hip-hop since i was very young, at 8 i started.but ATCQ was by far one of the best groups i've listened to. &quot;I left My wallet in el segundo&quot; is a good song,so is &quot;bonita apple baum&quot;. Yes this album is definently a classic. &quot; Push it along&quot; is an excelent track, one of the best on the album. to any ATCQ fan, you should cop this immediatly! I love this album!  I am a big fan of all of Tribe's work, but this first piece is inspired and creative, clearly made before the tribe saw some more difficult times.  Definately worth adding to your collection. You Knew when Tribe first came Out that they were Something Special&amp;SUre Enough that is the case with this Disc.The words&amp;Music are Solid all the way Through.this is A Must Have.I Left My Wallet In El  Segundo&amp;Can I Kick It are Two Of The Jams. Chemistry is the key factor in making magic happen on wax and the Tribe unit did it well with such style and grace.  From beginning to end, you feel the complete wrath of supreme abstract poet, Q-Tip, the tight and blatant lyrical skills of Phife Dawg, and the brilliant production courtesy of wizard Ali Shaheed.  Great music comes deep within and it's definite proof on this hip-hop classic. Out of the Tribe's 5 albums, this one is the greatest. The Tribe basically invented rap as we know it now. Tip's solo career is not exactly super-hot, but don't base your decision on Tip. Even though there is little Phife on this album, he's still awesome. Sha is cool too, even though he's not my favorite. There's timeless tribe tracks on this one. One of the best hip-hop albums ever, in my opinion, overshadowed by later works. Had to add it back to my collection once I lost it. Every song is creative and tight. Okay everybody, let's sit down and examine this album before we start raving about how this album is classic material.  Is it a dope LP?  Most definitely.  Is it creative and original?  No question.  Is it superior to almost every hip hop release of the 90's?  Yup.  Are there classic joints on the album?  Ooodles of them, no question.  Is it a classic LP?  I'd have to say that it is.  When compared to The Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders, this album starts to fall short.  I'm one of the few people that thinks Midnight Marauders is just as good (and probably better than) Illmatic.  'Nuff said.  And The Low End Theory is one of the first CDs I ever bought ater I stopped copping tapes.  Even today you can find me reciting lyrics from ""Buggin' Out"".  But that's not saying that this album isn't as phat.  When this album came out, you hadn't heard their next two albums yet, and the originality and the funk made it a must have because it sounded like nothing else on the market at the time (not even De La's sound was this phat).  Remeber, rap was begginging to get ""gangsta"" because of the success of acts like Kool G. Rap, NWA, Ice T, Schooly D, and many other hardcore artists, so this album was more than just a fresh and funky album, it was a very welcome change of pace.  The first three Tribe albums are classic releases, but if I had to rank them, this one would be third with Low End Theory coming in second.  Midnight Marauders is probably one of the most beautiful albums I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing, so that one would be first.I have a few beefs with the album though.  ""Push It Along"" is a decent song, but it's not good enough to hold your attention for such a long time (7:41).  Also, why does Phife only get 4 or 5 spots on the album?  He is a group member, right?  But those are very minor complaints that I have.The album as a whole is classic material in my humble opinion, there is an abundance of material that is most definitely timeless and sure to stay with you years after your first listen.  I reccomend this album to all fans of music.  And if you're a rap fan that hasn't heard it yet, then your rap pass ought to be revoked.  I'd have to say that this album sounds like a stripped down version of The Low End Theory LP (in my opinion, that's a good thing).  This album should be experienced by all that consider themselves to be rap fans and all others as well.Standout Tracks: Youthful Expression, After Hours, Public Enemy, Luck Of Lucien, Ham 'N Eggs, Can I Kick It?, Description Of A Fool (My Favorite), Rhythm, Bonita Applebum, and Go Ahead In The Rain Great album that started the Tribe's journey. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to get into ATCQ or for a fan that possibly just skipped out on this album. Quite possibly the finest album in hip hop history.  When Tribe came onto the scene in the late 80's, no one in hip hop were the using the type of beats they employed.  By mixing jazz and smooth R &amp; B, they created a  totally original and innovative sound that still sounds fresh ten years  later.  Q-Tip is the best MC in the business and has a voice as sweet as  honey.  He and Phife mesh perfectly together.  There is not a bad song on  the album and standouts include &quot;Push It Along&quot;, &quot;Luck Of  Lucien&quot; &amp; &quot;Can I Kick It?&quot;.  Tribe preach a message of  positivity and pride in yourself and your culture.  This album was a breath  of fresh air amid all the negative vibes and anger that was coming from the  hip hop community at the time.  This album has stood the test of time and  nothing that has come along in hip hop has yet to match it.  This is not  only a hip hop masterpiece, but a musical masterpiece and it can be  compared with the greats of any genre. People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm is the best rap album ever created.  Bold words for sure, but This is why:1.  Out of all the rap albums I've listened to, no other album seems to combine jazz and rap as well as this one does.  Laden with an effortless, laid-back feel, People's eccentric mix of jazz guitar, soul and funk horns, and numerous samples, mixes up with the irresistible Jazz-syncopated rhythms, with the kind of vibrant color of history .  While their other albums have jazz influences as well, they just don't seem to have the right sampling or feel that this album seems to have.2.  For me, A Tribe Called Quest's music is an artistic experience, and not just limited to the actual brilliant music.  The package, with its distinctly Afro-centric and urban artwork, sums up the theme, the overall feel of the album, extremely well.  The rhythms, the samples, the overall atmosphere, and the imagery.  All of these things swirl up into a vibrant, neon-tinged burst of colorful, vibrant, and urban experience, and this is reflected everywhere from the packaging to the actual music inside.3.  People who say that rap is not music sometimes seem to forget that rap can evoke feeling and emotion in a way that no other genre can (same could be said for Rock and Classical, but I digress).  The album is full of meaningful artistic expression, such as the gripping and powerful musing on domestic abuse during the closing track.  Even the beats include them as well.  Listen to the way that rhythm in After Hours just perfectly underlies the overall mood of the song, and makes the song just spring to life.  Indeed, rhythm is a powerful musical tool for expression (just look at dance, as a whole), and this album proves this.4.  ""Least danceable rap album ever"".  According to Rolling Stone, this is the least danceable rap album ever made.  Well, I don't know what that particular reviewer was dancing to, but each song here is propelled by some of the most brilliant and infectious grooves I've ever seen.  Really, listen to that amazing organic stomping on I Left My Wallet In El Segundo, and tell me you aren't dancing.  Trust me, if you have an ear for excellent rhythms, you have got to listen to this one.5.  The concept of the gospel group.  What other rap album has a gospel format?  This always definitely has a rich and warm atmosphere, and gospel is definitely one of the most raucous, uplifting, and meaningful musical genres you can get behind.  The inclusion of this, well, it only adds to this albums one of a kind personality and vibe.6.  For me, this album was the album that solidified my own self imposed argument considering the artistic merits of Hip-Hop.  I give high praises to artists that are able to raise the bar, and I give high praises for these guys, because without them I don't think I would have ever gave the genre a chance (considering all I used to listen to was Lil' Jon beforehand).  Maybe it may be considered a stepping for some, but for me (despite discovering some truly abstract and underground artists like Eyedea, Aesop Rock, and the like).  It's no wonder these guys were so revered and respected amongst the community, and this album (along with other groups like De La Soul, The Roots, and the like) is the reason why I am aboard the train.7.  Oh, it's my personal favorite because it does more for me emotionally and personally than any other Hip-Hop album ever made.  I guess that's counts, right?That, for me anyway, is why People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm is my favorite Hip-Hop album of all time.  Many albums have come close, and my respect and knowledge of the genre, as meager as it still is, has broadened considerably. In a time of Gangsta Rap a few MC's known as the ""Afrocentric Native Tongues"" who preached non-violence and exploring the Rich African cluture were slowly on the rise. The likes of De La Soul, the Jungle Brothers, Big Daddy Kane, and most importantly A Tribe Called Quest were stopping the street violence and starting the intellectual street smarts. And while many may say that De La Soul is the greatest Afrocentric Hip Hop group...they would be wrong. For this album not only proves just how amazing A Tribe Called Quest is...it also shows that Intellect is more valuable than Brawn:1.Push It Along-A2.Luck Of Lucien-A3.After Hours-A4.Footprints-A5.I Left My Wallet In El Segundo-A+(Best Song On CD)6.Public Enemy-A7.Bonita Applebum-A-8.Can I Kick It?-A9.Youthful Expression-A10.Rhythm(Devoted To The Art Of Moving Butts)-A11.Mr. Muhammed-A12.Ham 'N' Eggs-A13.Go Ahead In The Rain-A+(3rd Best Song On CD)14.Description Of A Fool-A+(2nd Best Song On CD) Whoa! This album is by far the best investment I've ever made. 11 years after it was released this is still ahead of all comers, with the possible exception of Eminem.It is so laid back, as is Quest's confidence in relaying their message, that it shows the correct way to make a hip-hop album and getting across a message. i.e. without cursing too much, not because it is offensive, but it is unimaginative.There are no poor tracks on this album. Obviously everyone will have favourites, but unlike, say, on a Dre album, the favourites will not be the same for all.Pick up this record. But if you don't it's your loss. Like Phife said - this album is simply pure clean straightforward hip-hop at its finest.  A Tribe Called Quest really has to be one of the greatest groups of all time.  The fact that their first three albums where all equal classics is just amazing, not just for hip-hop but for any genre.""People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm"" is actually the last Tribe album I've bought to complete the set and it's just as perfect as their two follow ups.  While ""Low End Theory"" is heavy with the jazz elements and ""Midnight Marauders"" is edgy and at times dark, ""...Rhythm"" relies on creative sampling and laid back grooves.  This album is definitely one of the more chill CD's from start to finish I have of any genre.  The smooth production on ""After Hours"" & ""Push it Along"" makes you wanna kick back and relax.  The incredible horn sample on ""Luck of Lucien"" is sure to play-over and over again in your head.  Still, the album features some classic beats & production thanks to some now familiar samples (""El Segundo"", ""Bonita Applebum"", & ""Can I Kick It"").As always with the Tribe, the quality and style of the production is perfectly matched by the lyrics.  Q-Tip dominates the lyrical front, whose content may not be completely challenging but that is enjoyable and relaxing.  Tracks mostly rang from amusing story telling (""El Segundo"", ""Luck of Lucien""), to straight up rhyming (""Can I Kick It""), to women (""Bonita Applebum"") to just downright silly (""Ham & Eggs"").  Even the social concept material of ""Pubic Enemy"" and ""Description of a Fool"" sounds laid back and fun.Being a personal fan of Phife, ""Midnight Marauders"" is the essential Tribe album for me, yet this one is perfect it it's own right.  If you enjoy Tribe Called Quest at all, you're wasting your time by ignoring this album.  Even the most casual music fans will enjoy the feel of this album playing while cruising around in the car or being outside on a hot summer day.  While, ""...Rhythm"" may be an original classic in hip-hop, there's no real way to measure the amount of replay time this album has and how it only makes a perfect album that much better. This album is easily on the top 50 list of best rap albums of all time.  The best thing about that is that it's not even Tribe's best album.  The only better debut in hip-hop history is De La Soul's &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;.The intro to the first track, &quot;Push It Along&quot;, immediately lets the listener know that this is not your average rap album.  It's also not your average Tribe album.  This is the only record that has Tribe as a whole.  Jarobi's interludes are the only evidence that A Tribe Called Quest actually has (had) four members.  The interludes also add an extra and unique quality to the album.  They make it seem to be somewhat of a &quot;concept album&quot;.Overall, the reason this album is so good is Q-Tip.  He shines on every song.  His flow is fantastic and his voice is at its most innocent.  This album is also the best example of his and Tribe's good-naturedness and playfulness.  From &quot;Luck of Lucien&quot; to &quot;Ham and Eggs&quot;, the flat-out bizarre style of story-telling is a welcome addition to the hip-hop community.Phife's contribution to this album is a lot smaller than it is on future releases, but, in a way, makes his parts better.  &quot;Can I Kick It&quot; in particular shows how well he compliments the crew.  The back-and-forth flow between him and Q-Tip on &quot;Ham and Eggs&quot; is also a good example of this.Also a key feature to this album is Ali's scratching technique.  Although some of his later productions are better, these are pretty damn good, and the inclusion of his scratching makes them better.Included on this disc are two bonus tracks that are every bit as worthy of bein on this album as any of the other ones on it.  &quot;Go Ahead In the Rain&quot; is one of Tip's best solos, and &quot;Description of a Fool&quot; shows off Ali's ability of combining several different samples to create a really great song.Bottom line: This is a turning point in rap's history.  If you don't already own this album, buy it now! It's hard to summarize the power of this album in a simple album review.  These artists understand the power of communication and they use it effectively.  The tracks on this CD are so deep and multi-layered that I still find myself discovering new words and sounds almost 15 years later.To put it in perspective, I purchased this CD 3 times and I'd buy it again if I had to.Purchase one: Cassette tape.  I listened to it so many times it got warped.Purchase two: another cassette tape (I STILL didn't have a CD player yet)Purchase three: CDIf you love strong beats and music with a positive, yet real message you'll groove on this CD. No matter how many years have passed since this album first came out, &quot;People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; will always remain as not only one of the best hip-hop albums of all time, but  also intelligent, creative, and just fresh.  There is nothing better than  hearing the Phife take over the mic after Q-Tip and Malik finish with their  lyrical manifestations, ejaculations, and flowtations.  Tribe will always  be one of the best hip-hop groups to ever live, and it hurts to say this,  but I doubt that there will ever be another like them.  Gosh, I never knew  jocking could be so tiring! I am glad that I bought this album. Funky music and they had great 'flows' and rarely cursed. Too bad Hip Hop music could not sustain making good music with curse-free lyrics.Anyway, I would suggest others get this in their collection!! I first heard the track ""Footsteps"", from this album, on my cousin's turntable (he's a DJ) when I was 18.I HAD to know who made it and I got it the first week before i went to university.  Their sound was jazzy and their flow was dynamic.  I fell in love with Q-Tip, Fife and most definitely Mr. Muhammad.My favorites would be ""Push It Along"", ""Footsteps"", ""Bonita Applebaum"" (although I like the remix version best), ""Go Ahead in the Rain"" and ""Description of a Fool""If you have any appreciation for hip hop or want to know what good hip hop is (not most of the BS currently in rotation), get it. There is no need for a lengthy explaination of why you should buy this album. It is a style that has never been duplicated. It is a classic. The songs have beats that will get you moving and the lyrics are incredible.  Buy the album, especially since they split, as you will never hear this  type of rap again. This is there best Album, it's just fun to listen to.I love those interludes threw out the Album from Jarobi{Wit My Questers...In My Way...}.Push it Along & Lucc of Lucien are to cee played together at all times, that's what i do when they come up on my ipod shuffle.This Album has my child hood classics like &#34;I left my wallet in El Segundo&#34; & &#34;Bonita Applebum&#34;,also {Buddy from 3ft high an rising}.I don't cemember can i kicc it? but i luv that tracc, Youth Expression is also sicc.This is top five, also The Chronic, ILLmatic, the Purple Tape{OB4CL},& Aquemini. On this onje come on now stop it, this is one of the nastiest jazz-rap or hip hop cds I've ever heard, I mean have ya'll listened to this every song is gold, this record I spin just about everyday it's that nice, it's way nicer then 85% of the stuff that comes out these days. Building off of the buzz they got working on the classic posse joints Jungle Brothers - Doin Our Own Thang and De La Souls's ""Buddy"" came People's Instinctive Travels. I remember catching the Elsugundo video and thinking I might go cop that album. But after I saw Bonita Applebum's video it was a wrap. The only thing bad that I can say about this album is the baby that is crying at the beginning of Push it along, other than that this one is a winner. Nowadays, people want to label Tribe as alternative or jazz rap but in my opinion A Tribe Called Quest is one of the greatest, original, dopest rap groups ever.Top Joints:Footprints (Dope)Luck of LucienBonita Applebum (Classic)Can I Kick It?Push it AlongTh Art of Moving Butts (Dope)Go Ahead in the RainDescription of a FoolClassic Material! A wonderful introduction to ATCQ. This was/s hip hop from when it was frsh, original and innovative. Back when Q-tip was the abstract poet, Ali Shaheed Muhammed handled the production phife was just begingnto rhyme and  they even had Jarobi in to group. This album exudes freshness even 10 years  after it's release.  Standout cuts are; Push it along, Footprints, Bonita  applebum, Can I kick it, Youthful expression. A must for and  native tongue  or tribe fan. So smooth and funky,this bridges the gap betweenclassic jazz and rap. I did not get this album in 1990 when it was released. Instead, I picked  it up ten years later.(Shame on me!). But, nonetheless, it just goes to  show that this album is timeless, because it surpasses almost all of the  hip hop that I hear today. I purchased this because I have always loved A  Tribe Called Quest and I knew that this one was a classic. Some of my  favorite jams are: Push It Along, Luck Of Lucien, I Left My Wallet In El  Segundo, Bonita Applebum, and Can I Kick It. If you are Tribe fan or if you  love hip hop and you do not own this album, do not wait ten years, like I  did(although, you would still love the album). Purchase this album now! One of the best albums of 1990, ""People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm"" is the Tribe's most under-appreciated and over-shadowed album to date. When you think of classic ATCQ, you think ""Low End Theory"" and ""Midnight Marauders"", but what about the debut that got them started? Although the classics like ""bonita applebum"" and ""can I kick it"" are still getting recognition 16 years later, the other tracks on the album are pretty much left in the dark to be slept on & ignored. For me, this album is equal in brilliance to ""Low End Theory"" and ""Midnight Marauders"", and considering this is 1990, it is as fresh as anything they have ever done! Ali Shaheed Muhammad comes 100% correct for their debut, producing straight classics ensuring a strong foundation for Q Tip & Phife Dawg to work with. Yes, and you can bet that both MC's hit you with the non-stop hypnotizing, conscious & creative lyrics throughout. Personally, the only track that does not have as much replay value as the rest is ""Ham & Eggs"", but then again the concept of this song isn't meant to be dead serious so it's down to taste. Now, if you are a fan of the tribe/early 90's hiphop/Jazzy & Conscious Hiphop then this is for you. Cop this asap! You NEED it. PEACE!>>>BEST TRACKS, in my opinion, are; Push it along (Pure excellence), Luck of Lucien, Footprints, Can I Kick It & Youthful expression&lt;&lt;&lt;Lyrics - 10/10Beats - 10/10Originality - 9.5/10Replay Value - 9/10If you found this helpful, check my other reviews Ok, all you young thugs cranking the same ""holla"" raps need to listen up. I used to love Hip Hop. Then it got played out, thug heavy,  uncreative and plutocracized (look it up bitches)by P-Ditty and Wu-Family schlock. Nothing can compare to Tribe Called Quest at their peak.  This album was the pinnacle of stylistic raps, groovy rhythms and a track lineage that works as a full album.They dont make them like this anymore. A Tribe Called Quest is one of the greatest groups ever in hip hop, and if you own any of their albums, you know why. This debut album is so great to listen to. At first, I wasn't impressed by it. But after the second listen, I realized that it IS a classic. It was released in 1990 along with other gems that year, and ATCQ certainly made their mark. Here's the review:Album Highlights: Although there's no filler, the highlights are Luck of Luciei, Can I Kick It, I Left my wallet in El Segundo,and Bonita Applebum.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: This is a great album, and you should own this it you currently don't have it. ATCQ only got BETTER as the years went by, and this album was a tremendous start in that direction. Strongly recommended. Laid back album. Ill beats on here to. And great lyrics. This cd has a couple of hits on it that people know of of course. Real hiphop  here. A lot of bump bangin beats. Im sort of new to TCQ's music but I can feel there vibe and style since im not new to hiphop! Check this album out for sure!My Top 51.Luck Of Lucien2.Footprints3.Public Enemy4.Bonita Applebum5.Can I Kick It This was the second tribe album i bought i was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they didn't have it at the best buy i went to. I like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip. Most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot. All like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein, afterhours, foot prints, i left my wallet in el segundo, bonita applebum, can i kick it, rhythm, go ahead in the rain, and description of a fool. Man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable. I wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd. The only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs. This is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics. Late spring of '90, I was stationed in Panama and keeping up with the latest hip-hop was challenging down there.  Luckily, select members of my unit deployed to Florida to assist some Army Reservists in a training event, and I was one of them.  After a couple days there, I was walking around in our billeting area and I noticed this tape on a fellow Soldiers' cot with this unusually catchy cover.  I picked it up and was like ""Who in the hell is Tribe Called Quest?""  The guy whose tape it was just said ""listen to it"".  I put that tape in my Walkman (LOL!) and haven't been the same since.  Listening to that tape of 'People's Instinctive Travels.."" was like a cave man discovering fire during the ice age - He knew he was missing SOMETHING but didn't know what that SOMETHING was until it manifested.  I immediately went out and bought the tape and in the words of Notorius BIG, ""I let me tape rock till my tape popped!""  Then went out and bought another one.Well now I have this gem in CD and mp3 format so I don't have to worry about that anymore. Skip the comparisons to '3 Feet High', 'Low End', and 'Midnight'.  'People's Instinctive' was the elevation and natural forward progression of '3 Feet High' and I'm sure the Native Tongues don't see it as anything else.  It laid the groundwork for 'Low End' and 'Midnight' - bottomline is they wouldn't be the classics they are without it.  As a guy who has been following hip-hop continuously since 1977 I say to all true lovers of the genre not familar with Tribe Called Quest and to all hip-hop newcomers get this CD and experience the real essence of the urban innovation called hip-hop. Then get their next 2 CDs.  You will not be disappointed because of all the groups over the years, no one captured that essence in its pure form better than A Tribe Called Quest.","Pop Rap,Experimental Rap,Jazz,Soul,Pop,East Coast,R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Blues",atacq one underrated artists australia cuts ever get played tv quot kick quot stuff last really proves among best groups early opening quot push along quot really sets mood rest q tips flow understated say least hes able drop incredible lines poetry time may bit tempo jazz rap talking though end listeners calling chorus quot luck lucien quot another classic lyrics moulded beat way top mcs entire storyline yes story superbly done standouts quot bonita applebum quot course provided fugees guitar thing quot killing softly quot quot left wallet el segundo quot possibly underrated artists cuts played tv quot kick quot stuff really proves best groups early opening quot push quot really sets mood rest q tips tips flow understated say able drop incredible lines poetry time bit tempo jazz jazz rap rap talking end listeners calling chorus quot luck classic lyrics moulded beat way mcs entire storyline story superbly standouts course provided fugees guitar quot killing softly quot left wallet possibly
194,400,B0000004WI,"The song Ghetto the lyric & the Bass should be place in rapper hall of fame , Alone the song it's your life . This was a gift and they thoroughly loved it and love bring back in the days to some young people... it is nice listening to some old school music that i listened to in the day. too short is one of my favorite Not only is this a classic, source, xxl, or any of the above.  But for the real true hip-hop and rap fans and not these modern day bandwagon jumpers, u understand that old school rap is about not only delivery but a time frame.  This record gives you a blueprint of real life hood experiences for people who were actually present from 1984 to 1993.  Of course someone who just began or was exposed to rap would think of the new rappers as their foundation it is what you were trying to understand.  But these old school rappers are the foundation, take away their deliveries, punchlines, and stories, and you have no hip-hop or rap, give respect to the pioneers who did it for almost next to nothing because it was for the feeling inside and not for what the public expected them to do or be.  RECOGNIZE u B*****s!!!!!! Too short speaking the truth in this album. Also my favorite single song The Ghetto is in this album, which appeared in gta San Andreas. Real classic this album is and I like it a lot Short Dog's In The House is the third release from Oakland, California's pimp, pioneer Too Short.  This album begins with the title track where Playboy Short flow non-stop without any hook or chorus over a Mario Bros. type of track.  He also gets to reality about life on ""It's Your Life"" and ""The Ghetto"" as his offer alternatives to the streets or the illegal life.  The production with live funk guitar licks over a mellow track is the highlight of ""Short But Funky"".  Short takes aim at the rumors spread over his death and overdose on ""Dead Or Alive"".  ""Punk Bitch"" has clean production with piano chords to elevate the graphic, x-rated tales in this song.  ""Ain't Nothin' But A Word To Me"" featuring Ice Cube has them both sharing several verses over a simple West Coast track.  The highlight of this album is found where Too Short mack over an Ohio Players sample breakdown as the bridge with a memorable opening ""...Sunshine, convertible tops / you call 'em rags, we call 'em drops / you ride black walls, we ride Vogues / you got a girlfriend, we pimp hoes...""  ""Rap Like Me"" is like the blueprint of how he made it and how he does it as a self proclaimed ""...the best damn rapper that ever touched a mic...""  Always original and stick to his formula and style that cause for longevity.  Respect game, beeeeitch! What I like about Too Short back in the 80's and early 90's was the fact that he had ambition in his rhymes. Believe it or not, every verse he kicks on the songs in his sixth album ""Short Dog's In The House"", he kicks with confidence. My favorite hit single he as ever made in his career would be ""The Ghetto"". Short kicks facts of how life is in the streets of Oakland, something that he hardly did in his music. Also ""It's Your Life"" would be another positive song that he made. If you began listening to Short after his retirement, when you hear this you'll probably won't be used to hearing rhymes like this. I can't forget his pimp game. ""Pimpology"" would be the breakdown on how to keep a listener's pimp game up. Ice Cube, the only guest appearance on this album would appear on ""Ain't Nothin' But A Word To Me""...and you probably know what that word is.A lot of this material sounds dated, but I'm not mad at it. It reminds me of how rap was back in 1990. The rhymes Short kicked were just simple rhymes about rocking parties and his pimp game. The production on here has a little '90 flavor as well. A lot of these songs were either produced or co-produced by Too Short. Which is actually kind of good. The beat to ""Hard On The Boulevard"" is dope, made by Short by himself. Other producers are Sir Jinx and DJ Pooh, as well as some of the songs by Pierre ""The Beat Fixer"" James, Keenan ""The Mastero"" Foster, and Al Eaton. The latter name would help with Short on ""The Ghetto"", another beat that I liked, which is good that there is an instrumental of the song on the last track.Too Short already made a name for himself and help put Oaktown on the map. If you like music from the early 90's, this one I think you will enjoy. It shows Too Short rocking the mic with no fear at all. And whats great about this is this isn't even his best album, so there was more to come after this one.Lyrics: A-Production: AGuest Appearances: AMusical Vibes: A+Overall: AMy favorite Tracks: $hort Dog's In The House, Short But Funky, In The Oaktown, Ain't Nothin' But A Word To Me, PimpologyPersonal Favorite Track: The GhettoHonorable Mention Track: Rap Like MePeace Everyone!!! ""My 2nd favorite rap album would be Too $hort, Short Dog's In The House""-Nuttso of Oakland's Street Thugs.Too $hort mastered the science of his craft with this fantastic album. Todd Shaw was a consistent rap artist on a major label from ""Born To Mack"" up until 1995's ""Cocktales"". ""Short Dog's In The House"" is his most focused set of songs with memorable production to back it. There's a diverse range of subject matter such as rumors about his demise, the influence of his independent success, the hardships of ghetto life, pimping 101, and turning two of the late 80's biggest RnB/Pop singers into exploited porn stars,lol. ""In The Oaktown"" is a funkier, updated version of ""Oakland"" from the last album.The only thing that tarnishes this flawless effort a little bit is the last track ""Rap Like Me"". A new version of ""Cusswords"" which doesn't work because the beat is mediocre. ""Pimpology"" would of been a great way to end it. This album came out during an exciting year for Oakland, CA. 1990. MC Hammer, EnVogue, Toni,Tony, Tone, and Pebbles were blowing up the music scene and putting Oaktown on the map. With the exception of skipping the last song, this has all the ingredients that make a classic album. From the great cover art drawing just like ""41fivin'"", ""Doggystyle"", and ""Makaveli"". Consistent music from the beginning to the end, and the timing of the album's release. This is Todd Shaw's greatest musical opus. Short Dog's In the House is a west coast classic. ""The Ghetto"" is what originally made me a Too Short fan. His sixth album overall, this is when Short became even more mainstream after the success of Life is Too Short. Most of the tracks are bass heavy, and the production is a lot better. Now on certain tracks like ""Pimpology"", you'll notice the volume level is a bit low. In that case just crank up your volume control. Most of the tracks are can't miss, particularly the first six. Besides ""The Ghetto"", the best tracks are ""Dead or Alive"", ""Pimpology"", ""Paula and Janet"", ""In the Oaktown"", and ""Its Your Life"". Subsequent releases like Shorty the Pimp and Get In Where You Fit In (both which I reviewed) further expanded and established Short as one of Cali's premiere hip hop artists. I do miss the days when this first dropped. But I listen to the classics on a regular basis and it rarely sounds dated. Too Short has many great hits, but in my opinion, from start to finish, this is his best work ever. This is from someone who has his first 8 major releases and even a couple from when he was slinging tapes out of the trunk of his car. If you claim to be a Too Short fan and don't have this one, you're not really a Too Short fan. If you want some vintage Short Dog this is the one to get. I have looked for this Cd for years. One of my favorite old school rap Cds.Can't get enough of it. If you like Too $hort.You have to put this in your collection. This is the 11th Too $hort album I have, and his oldest (I still have to get ""Life is..."" & ""Born To Mack"", and of the 11, this is my 2nd or 3rd favorite, and another classic from the Oakland Pimp.  With 12 songs, most are over 5 minutes so you still get a lot of raps, 2 are classics,1 is ok, the other 9 are tight, with mostly all of them being near classics.  Guests are very minimal, as with most of the older rap albums, rapping on 1 song and doin the hook on 1.  He has the smooth pimped out flow and some great stories as with most of his earlier albums, over some GREAT, funky production, mostly handled by $hort himself (he does 10 of the sogns with co-production from Al Eaton, Maestro, and Pierre James).  Sir Jinx and DJ Pooh each do a song as well.  A must have classic from one of rap's Icons and old school vets, the original Pimp from the Oaktown!#1 - 8.5#2 - 8#3 - 9 (f/ Gary Mackey -- tight beat)#4 - 9 (nice beat)#5 - 10 (CLASSIC -- great beat)#6 - 10 (CLASSIC -- great storyline and beat)#7 - 9 (a great dirty song from $hort over a tight beat)#8 - 8.5 (f/ ice Cube -- good beat)#9 - 9 (tight beat)#10 - 9.5 (some Pimpin game spit from Short)#11 - 8.5 (great dirty story about 2 h0E$)#12 - 7 (he raps for a good 6+ minutes here)Todd Shaw -- b. 4/29/66 -- b. Los Angeles, CA moved to Oakland, CACheck all my Reviews Hard on the Boulevard and argue with me that Too Short wasn't one of the 3 best West Coast rappers of the early 90's. There are so many great songs on this record, if you don't already own it you're missing out. All the beats bump hard and Shorts droppin knowledge all over this. Its lyrically well-rounded (considering), there's actually a lot more to this than what you may expect from him. Much like Cocktails, it represents Short to the fullest with original raps and dope tracks! Short Dawg is one of the mst vulgar rappers you will ever hear and this CD is not for the faint of heart. I enjoy the beats and was lucky enough to come across the clean version of this CD some of the songs (such as the duet with ICE CUBE) have so many vulgarities in them that you cannot even hear the song because of the editing. short dawg always did a clean side and a dirty side to his albums and I always prefered the clean stuff. My favorite song by him to this day is the song ""The Ghetto"" If you enjoy old school rap and are not easily offended this comes highly recomended. One of the reason i am such a fan of Old too short (before 1996) is because nobody can attemept to copy his style or was he even close to commercial. Even though he has been with jive since 1988 he has stayed close to the bay back then. Short Dog's in the house ties between Cocktales. I've gotta give this CD 5 stars because i can ride to the whole CD. What i liked best about the whole CD was Todd's honesty. He didn't make an attempt to make the album commercial. All from his heart about his lifestyle. Well actually rap like me is not a great song but as long as I skip that track the CD is awesome. Even though I didn't really grow up early Short because of I was a little kid back then plus from the East but when i heard this album a few years ago I decided it was one of favorite out of the 15 I have heard. Defenitly a solid CD. Plus the sound quality is better then his late 80 albums. If you want a sound of the bay in the early 90's why haven't you heard short dogs in the house? For every Too Short review check out my other reviews Short Dog`s In The House is one of the best hip hop albums ever made from one of the best and most underrated MC around. This album, along with Life Is... is Too Short at his best. He really put together a classic with his excellent storytelling, which perfectly captured that period back in the day about life combined with dope beats. If you`re into old school hip hop or want to educate a younger hip hop fan that thinks that today`s hits, which IMO are too safe and overly commericalized, are all that, about the roots of the genre. Then Short Dog`s In The House is one of those albums that you have to get. this define nasty, harcore funk. if you on this page, you like short. cocktails wasn't the best. get in where you fit in not the best. check it out-this is the best short dog-EVER!not born to mack, well maybe that was tight too. you need to check this out dough homeboi. if you need to know which short cd's are the best, short dogs, born to mack, life is too short, i liked cocktails, too. those the best ones, shawty. but if you really like too short, do that nigga a favor, and don't buy none of his new shit. it give me a headache to hear my boi talk like so. and if you really a rap fan, you bumped too short, i don't give a d*** what you saypartner, PEACE. This cd is great uncut version the cd is so classic that I loaned it out and didn't get it back so I ordered and received another one .And I will not be loaning this one out All of you have forgotten the most important point.  If you look at the back of the CD you will notice that the ""The Ghetto"" is listed at 5:59 but when you play the CD you will notice that song has been edited; the best part of the song was lefted off the CD.  The originial CD I bought in the 90's had the entire song, but the one I bought recently is about a minute shorter and you miss the significance of the song without that last minute.You have to hear that part of the song to really appreciate the song. Together with Shorty the pimp, Short dog's in the house is Too Short's best work. Funky music with x-rated raps. With this album Too Short consolidated his funky sound which already became evident on his  Life's...Too Short album. One track on this CD will probably be Short's  greatest hit, The Ghetto, it's a remake of a classic soul song. If you're  seriously into rap you need this album in your collection. It's an  important exponent of Bay Area and West Coast rap, lesser known tha Snoop  Dogg's Doggystyle, but just as important. Short can be seen as an importnat  influence in rap since his influemce can be seen with artists as Snoop  Dogg, Master P to Puff Daddy as he was one of the first to exploit the Mack  Daddy Player image. brought back memories great album Nowadays it's easy to see that Snoop Dog stole his sound and persona from Short Dog. like Snoop, Too Short's tepid beats and predictable rhymes are uninspiring and limp. Fans of hard core rap will be bored, though fans of funk influenced hip hoppers like Snoop Dogg and Luscious Jackson will doubtless be impressed. Short is a bit like a Tone Loc without the wit. I admit that the Ice Cube duet `Ain't Nothing But A Word To Me ` is amusing but that ain't enough to recommend the album. Skip it. Too short says things that are real n is happening in the hood!! He is just a great lyrisit n rapper","Pop Rap,Soul,Pop,R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Southern Rap,Gangsta & Hardcore,Blues,West Coast",ghetto lyric bass place rapper hall fame alone life gift thoroughly loved love bring back days young people nice listening old school listened day short one favorite classic source xxl real true hip hop rap fans modern day bandwagon jumpers u understand old school rap delivery time frame record gives blueprint real life hood experiences people actually present course someone began exposed rap would think new rappers foundation trying understand old school rappers foundation take away deliveries punchlines stories hip hop rap give respect pioneers almost next nothing ghetto lyric bass place rapper hall fame life gift thoroughly loved love bring bring back days young young people people nice listening old old school school listened day short favorite classic source xxl real true hip hip hop hop rap fans modern day bandwagon jumpers understand old old school old school rap school rap delivery time time frame frame record blueprint real real life life hood experiences people actually present course began exposed rap think new rappers foundation trying understand old old school school rappers foundation take away deliveries punchlines stories hip hip hop hop rap respect pioneers
195,401,B0000004WM,"Samantha's first hitless album (at least in the US) follows pretty much the same formula as her others. PWL hi-nrg productions, full force productions, some rocking girl pop, and some house music that hints more at the 90s sound than the 80s. If you like her other albums, you should like this one just as well. There are several curiosities as well. There's a medley of 70s disco tracks More More More and Love to Love You Baby. A cover of Kiss's Rock n Roll All Night. Samantha doing the track Walking On Broken Glass, which would be a hit for Annie Lennox. And a very Stock Aitken Waterman hi-nrg recording of That's What Love Can Do before it became a more downtempo hit for Boy Krazy. Plus, the numerous bonus tracks and remixes make this a great deluxe edition. Track list:CD1(Hurt Me! Hurt Me!)

I was living in Europe at the time and it was a huge hit over there.  When I discovered the album by the same title I bought it right away in order to  start my collection of Samantha fox.  Browsing through the other albums I  heard the samples for &quot;Just one night&quot; and thought, I have to get  this one next. I didn't know about the album until I got onto the net and  discovered Amazon.com (yes my life is nothing without Amazon.com)  the  samples hooked me so I ordered it.  On the first listen, I thought, Give me  a break, can't the woman do anything more then moan and groan her way  through a song?  I liked Hurt me Hurt me but knew right away it would not  be a favorite of mine.  &quot;Love to love you&quot; is much better though  she goes overboard with the moaning.  for me the best track on the album is  &quot;Another woman&quot; &quot;Spirit of America&quot; grew on me and so  did &quot;pleasure zone.&quot;  I can see however with this album why  Samantha's career suddenly dried up.  I mean you've done it once with the  sex thing, move on; Madonna did.  this is the kind of CD that you will play  once in a while and only if you feel like listening to something different.  It certainly is not going in my top CD rack.  I do however like the spoken  word aspects of the album and would love it if Samantha released such a CD  for a laugh.  She sounds like a really nice woman, funny and sexy but her  problem from day one has been that she has put her sexuality above her  music and it cost her in the end. i buy this cd recently!wow!!amazing sound,amazing songs and samantha gave us her best in this alboum.i recomend it!!!!it worth it! &quot;Hurt me! Hurt me!&quot; was the best tune on the CD, but it wasn't as good as her earlier work. Although in the video she still looked hotter than the lid of a pot-bellied stove. I heard for the title track she had to sing completely in the nude to get just the right 'atmosphere'. She apparantly sang it to Paul Stanley of KISS because Paul had written a song about her called 'Heart of Stone' which appeared on the KISS album 'Revenge'.I think Miss Fox was scraping the bottom of the barrel for material on this album. She didn't do much writing anyway, but the Full Force gang had ridden it's course by 1991. She sould have found herself some new writers and got away from the third rate B-sides she was trying to push. Ah, Samantha Fox. She was an 80's pin-up queen, notorious for her days as a topless Page 3 model in the UK. She's also quite notorious for what could only be called 'sleazy cheese'. Campy pop songs with a naughty vibe in them sung by a naughty girl.Naughty Miss Fox opens the album up with the thumping club cut 'Hurt Me! Hurt Me! (But The Pants Stay On)'. Silly and sleazy is the tune she's playing here, and she plays it so well. Fun continues on with a medley of the disco classics 'More More More' and 'Love To Love You Baby', done in true Fox style. A clubby pop cut 'Don't Wait Up', is a good track too, and is followed  by the title cut, which is a funkier R&amp;B attempt.Sam's next track sort of reminds me of Janet Jackson's 'Escapade', and is called 'Pleasure Zone'. The rest of this album all falls along the same vein as these tracks, fun club pop from the early 90's. More good examples of this includes 'Don't Cry Wolf' and 'Saving It Up', the latter of which reminds me of the Pebbles single 'Giving You The Benefit'.Now there is one chunk of rather stinky cheese wedged in this fun little collection. The not necessarily bad 'Spirit Of America' is weak, in it's attempt at faux- patriotism. Sam's a Brit babe, why sing an ode to us? Very odd really. Not bad, but just, well, strange.I think it'd be really fun if Samantha Fox made a comeback. Hey, crazier things have happened. Fun little pop effort. Bought this old school Euro-pop 80s cd from the Fox for just one song, her Hurt Me Hurt me song.  It is so dated and so 80s.  Full Force produced this track and it is still fun listnening to it.  Eyebrow raising and finger popping fun! This is advertised as the 2012 remastered release. It is the original 1991 release only. No bonus. I am Very disappointed What makes this album good? What kind of styles she does? Since 1987, Sam decides to move from her rock roots to more of US Urban music by working with Full Force, Cheryil Pepsi Riley and Cilives and Cole and X Grilfriend. Now this album is good. Now Sam is very ecletic with her styles, like on this album, the first half were Freestyle and Hip Hop which was productions by Full Force and last 2 were rock styles except for what you see is what you get which sounds more pop. However, sam continues to go what she does best is sexual teases with her moans and sexual lyrics like Hurt Me! Hurt Me! But The Pants Stays on, More More More/Love To Love you Baby, the title track and Saving It Up, which she goes overboard with her moans. Nevertheless, this isn't a bad album but its worth listening to. If you like this album, try Kylie Minogue's lets get to it and martika's kitchen I re-bought this album for the track Samantha made with Clivilles and Cole, 'Pleasure Zone' and for the brilliant rework of 'That's What Love Can Do' and the bonus 'A Second Chance'. I've been interested in this artist for her work with PWL and Full Force also. Something tells me there may have been a bit of re-recording with 'That's What Love Can Do'. Samantha's vocals sound clearer and stronger, or it could just be a case of great use of the latest studio technology. Everything Cherry Pop has delivered has been fantastic to date , from an 80's music lover's perspective! I look forward to the release of 'Sequal' the deluxe edition (in a few days). I also hope that Matt-Pop can continue to recreate and produce more material (and I love the extra vocals). He's an outstanding artist.Buy and enjoy this album, it's worth it! Not every song was great but most of them are good but it was my less liked cd of Samantha Fox because not every song has a positive or favorable meaning to it. Sorry..&#62;:( A Good Album That Could Not chart A US Hit Single,So It Hurt The Sales,But I Still Like  This Album Anyway.Every Song Is Good But I Think It Would Done Better If It Came Out A Few Years Earlier Than It Did. Its One Of My Favorite Cds Of Samantha Fox After the success off &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; Samantha released this album in 1991. The first half is definitely very cool due to its dancey Full Force tracks. &quot;Pants Stay On&quot; is a thumper about not  having sex, which, ironically, is followed by a medley of disco classics  &quot;More, More, More&quot; &amp; &quot;Love To Love You Baby.&quot; The  medley is a great dance song and it's &quot;classic&quot; Sam. &quot;Don't  Wait Up&quot; is in the same vein as &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; with  Sam telling her man that she's going out to have fun, but the beat is  different and the song is great for any club. &quot;Just One Night&quot; is  very slow, but the end is humorous with Sam talking with her man.  &quot;Pleasure Zone&quot; is a fan-favorite but I never really liked it,  it's very rock/dance which doesn't do much for me, but others may like it.  You also get the original version of &quot;Another Woman (Too Many  People)&quot; which is cute because Sam raps the verses in that cute  cockney way. The rest of the album lags off. They are all rock/pop except  for &quot;Saving It Up&quot; which would have fit in better at the  beginning of the CD. The reason for the first half being dance and the  second half being rock is because Sam's record company wanted another  &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; and Sam wanted a more rock feel, and this  is what came out of their dispute - a so-so album. WELL TOO MANY WORDS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN AND TO MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID SO I WILL PUT IT IN ANOTHER SIMPLE WAY: ''JUST ONE NIGHT'' ALBUM BY SAMANTHA FOX WAS A GREAT ALBUM BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DIDN'T TOP THE CHARTS BECAUSE FOR  S O M E  P A R T I C U L A R  R E A S O N  IT HAD NO PROMOTION FROM THE SINGER'S RECORD LABEL! ITS SOUND WAS EXTREMELY FRESH AND MATURE (SAMANTHA WORKED WITH THE HOTTEST GROUP AT THAT TIME, C&C MUSIC FACTORY, AMONG ALL THE OTHERS PRODUCERS) AND IT WAS SIMPLY MUCH BETTER THAN SOME OTHER R'N'B ALBUMS THAT WERE RELEASED AT THE SAME TIME BUT HAD A BETTER PROMOTION AND THUS A BETTER LUCK TO THE CHARTS.... When Samantha Fox pens a song she sure knows how to make you feel it.  &quot;Nothing You Do, Nothing You Say&quot; is the best track here along  with a few others, &quot;Another Woman&quot;, &quot;Just One Night&quot;,  &quot;Pleasure Zone&quot;, and &quot;Spirit of America.&quot;  Check out  her I Wanna Have Some Fun cd she co-wrote another great song named  &quot;Confession.&quot; With this album Sam's career tumbled, which is understandable, because basically all songs are weak. You can get into the Full Force song ""Hurt me"", but already the lyrics aren't convincing. ""Another night"" or ""Spirit of America"" are rather boring songs stressing on hits like Madonna's ""Justify my love"" and American enthusiasm. Not convincing though samantha fox broke onto the scene as a cross between lita ford and kylie minogue (that would  be early kylie, before she flitted off to japan and reinvented herself and the diva du jour of the ultra-hip queer clique), _just one night_ finds her attempting to expand her audience base into the urban genre. with production and songwriting by full force and c+c music factory, and back-up vocals by full force proteges and powerhouse vocalists cheryl ""pepsii"" riley and ex-girlfriend, fox does successfully transition from a pop/rock to a pop/r&b vein, but it proves to be too little, too late. with the exception of the lead track, ""(hurt me! hurt me!) but the pants stay on"", which is a stand-out sheerly because it's such a novelty song, the material on _just one night_ sounds like b-sides from more talented artists of the day, like milli vanilli, new choice, seduction and pebbles.","Dance Pop,Dance & Electronic,R&B,Pop,House",samanthas first hitless least us follows pretty much formula others pwl hi nrg productions full force productions rocking girl pop house hints sound like like one well several curiosities well theres medley disco love love baby cover kisss rock n roll night samantha walking broken glass would hit annie lennox stock aitken waterman hi nrg recording thats love became downtempo hit boy krazy plus numerous bonus remixes make great deluxe edition list cd hurt hurt pants stay love love baby medley dont wait one night pleasure zone another woman many people dont cry wolf nothing nothing say saving spirit america see hitless follows pretty pretty much formula productions full force productions rocking girl pop house hints sound curiosities disco disco love love love baby cover rock rock n roll roll night walking broken glass hit annie lennox stock stock aitken waterman waterman recording love downtempo hit boy numerous bonus remixes great deluxe deluxe edition edition list cd hurt hurt pants stay love love baby medley dont dont wait wait night pleasure zone woman people dont cry cry wolf say saving spirit america see
196,402,B0000004WW,"Pay no attention to the last reviews this album is horrable.Don't even pay attention to this guy at all cause he sucks.Busy Bee 4 Life. Delivery wise I think this has to be one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Moe Dee kept getting doper on each album.  His delivery here is flawless.  I wish other MCs could rap this precise and this crystal clear.  Its a real treat to listen to comapared to most other MCs who by comparison mumble their flows.  He switches up his flows often, moving from slower paced to extremely fast.  Rhyme patterns are also excelent, and his choice of highly conscious subject matter mixed in with oldschool braggadocio is very entertaining.  I don't find the beats here sparse either, most of them are oldschool style implementing soul samples.  Very nice to listen to if you really are a fan of hip hop.  I also think he crushed LL, who despite media hype and fanfare, is most definantly the weaker MC.  If you don't think Moe Dee would've smashed him on the battle tip, you are delusional.  Thats why LL didn't have the cajones to accept his challenge to an actual battle.  Just pick this one up and all his other solo and group material.  His influence on hip hop was immense and he had a long, dope career.  Its a shame he does not get the recognition he deserves.  One of the top 5 greatest MCs ever in my honest opinion. This one was ok, but he was on his way out after this one.  His lack of hot beats and contiuning the LL battle after ""To da Break of Dawn"" closed the door on Moe Dee, Hammer and Ice-T all in one song!  If his beats would have gotten better, he could have lasted.What lisp?  Kool Moe Dee speaks loud and clear. KOOL MOE DEEFUNKE FUNKE WISDOMFor those who don't know Moe Dee is a legend in the realm of Hip Hop and commands respect no matter whom you are one of my favorite MC's of all time. He is probably best known for his beef with one LL Cool J, the majority of people are wrong on that topic. I believe that Moe Dee won the battle with LL and that L could not handle Moe Dee, and I know L laws crushed by Canibus. I believe that this was his forth album and most [including Moe Dee] consider this his weakest effort, whether that is true or not I like it and consider it a great album.1.INTRO-cool intro nice beat2.FUNKE WISDON-great horn driven beat by Moe and Teddy Riley that makes the song like he says funky, love the production on this track. Of course the wisdom is there as well as Dee drops nothing but knowledge of this funky production with excellent lyrics and great delivery. One of the best songs on the album.5/53.HERE WE GO AGAIN-over a very familiar sample and smooth production Moe Dee kills a party inspired track, even though it really isn't one. This track is kinda a diss to party rappers and tracks I think though I could be wrong. But when I listen to the lyrics I think that is exactly what it is. This is another great track and it still gets play from me in the ride, sounds great.5/54.TO THE BEAT YA'LL-Teddy Riley returns to drop a very simple yet catchy production that will have you nodding your head immediately. It has a simple hook and a cool old school feel to it even for that time so it sounds perfect. Moe Dee kills the track with ease with a great flow and delivery, and gets at LL Cool J on this in a laid back way. This is one of my favorite tracks on the album.5/55.HOW KOOL CAN ONE BLACKMAN BE-Moe and Teddy reunite to produce this track and do a cool job with a smooth easy going beat. Lyrically Dee does his thing on this track and drops some great verses, still something seems off. I don't know what it is but something about this track is off with me, but the horns in the chorus are wonderful.4.5/56.BAD,BAD,BAD-some cool production on this as it kinda holds back building its self up for a nice drop when it gets to the hook. Still much like the first there is something missing, but the verses are killer for sure. Dee destroys this track unlike he has on the previous tracks, a nice battle like verse. I think that this was kind of another dig a L but you be the judge.4/57.RISE `N' SHINE-ah yes one of the singles from the album and what a single it was, I still remember the video for this one. It was like a press conference or something with Dee, KRS-1, and Chuck D from Public Enemy. These three together made for a great group speaking nothing but truth and dropping killer verses like only these three could do. At the time I don't think there was any better as they prove their worth in the grand scale that is hip hop. Moe drops a great instrumental that all three sound great over.5/58.MO'BETTER-Teddy returns to drop another smooth production, this time for an interlude.9.I LIKE IT NASTY-Moe delivers on the production side masterfully once again, this may be my favorite beat on the entire album. It is smooth, cool and catchy especially the little touches added to the hook. Verse wise Dee dedicates this one to the ladies and while it is very different from the rest of the album I have a theory. I think he was dissing L again by trying to out do him in the ladies song department, it is up to you once again to judge. Lyrically it is cool but not up to par with the others but flow wise he is still on point and crisp. Another good song from this album.4/510.DEATH BLOW-of course I am sure any hip hop head remembers this song as it was Dee's  comeback to L's ""Break of Dawn"" and ""Mama said Knock you Out"". I personally think that Kool Moe Dee won the battle as he is much more advanced and on point lyrically and also called L out to battle live, L denied. As if you did not know Moe Dee destroys L on this track with verse after verse of vicious flows. And production wise Moe and Teddy deliver a funky old school battle influenced beat that will have all heads nodding. Love this song right here, especially since he fusses some L's stuff from his songs on here. The video of this was a parody kinda of L's ""Mama said Knock you Out"", classic.5/511.LET'S GET SERIOUS-another funky production here with Dee dropping more battle laced verse with nice lyrics, dope Mc'n if I do say so my self. This may be another jab at L but like I said before it is up to you to decide that. Me I think it could go either way but it does sound like he is getting at L again, of course either way it is nice. Another good song that all should like.4/512.POETIC JUSTICE-Moe teams with Keith Spencer and Dale Hogan to drop a fast paced funky instrumental that adds a new level to the album. Moe Dee's flow is still on point speeding it up a bit to match the beat, I love the beat during the hook. Dee kills it as expected and shows why he is respected by all in the hip hop community. Another good track that I listen to a lot, check it out.4.5/513.GANGSTA BOOGIE-even though this track influenced a lot of artists over the years including my favorite rapper Kurupt who had his younger brother's [Roscoe] group Y.A. remake the song or at least sample it I still feel like it is not up to par with some of the other tracks found here. It is a nice track with same production team from the last dropping a harder sound this time, but it still feels off. Dee is in story telling mode here and drops good verses but still.3.8/514.TIMES UP-the album ends on a good note with this old school sounding track, and for so reason I think of the movie ""Above the Rim"" when I hear this. The beat is catchy and cool and Dee does his thing on here dropping some good verses. This was a good way to end the album with Dee delivering like o other with a great flow, very precise.4.5/5Over all this may not be his best album but it is far from horrible and deserves a chance, I think it is close to classic. To that fool riding Sissy Bee's jock like a motorcycle, You are a loser in the truest sense! Busy Bee is party rapper and a cheesy one at that and this is the punk you idolize? SLAP YOURSELF!!! One last note: learn how to spell horrible(horrable?) dumbass!!! Now that that is out of the way. Kool Moe is one of the pioneers that makes you wonder why somebody so great is criminally overlooked. His rhyme style was bonkers and for me to listen to him to this day and still hear the freshness of his rhymes says a lot. On this album he shows a knowledgeable side as well as a hip hop side. Standout Tracks: Funke Wisdom, Poetic Justice, Gangsta Boogie, Times Up, and Bad,Bad,Bad show Kool Moe Dee at his best. Death Blow is the nail in the coffin to LL Cool J as Kool Moe Dee dices up a pop icon who sold out ages ago. Kool Moe Dee also takes shots at LL in the Teddy Riley produced To The Beat Ya'll. Krs-One and Chuck D team up with Kool Moe Dee on the dynamite track Rise 'N' Shine. Filler: How Kool Can One Black Man Be is not KMD at his finest moment and he sounds like he took a cue from LL with the extra cheesy I Like It Nasty. Bottom Line: Funke, Funke Wisdom should not forgotten for it shows the growth of an underrated pioneer. Kool Moe Dee rhymes on this album are still great and the production was on point(except for the two songs mentioned in the filler section). All in all its a good album that should be a part of your Kool Moe Dee collection. Kool Moe Dee was a heavy weight hitter back in the days with lyrics and beats. He could go lyric for lyric with the best of his day like Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, Chuck D, Run DMC and of course his arch nemesis .. LL Cool J. they had a classic battle that goes unoticed now and because of LLs comercial success and longevity, people forget Moe Dee use to get in LLs a___ on a lyrical tip! this is a great buy if you love 80s hip-hop and real lyrics from a master of the game! Moe Dee is real old school, sparse beats with lots of macho posturing. The kind of free style that PE made irrelevant, but it took awhile for the MC's to get the word. He's pretty quick and fairly interesting given his self-imposed limitations, and this album is a good pick to get a feel for him. One amusing thing about him is he has a lisp, a funny affliction for a macho rapper. Not really my thing, by fans of Eric B &amp; Rakim, 3rd Base, Big Daddy Kane and LL Cool J will probably enjoy him. Moe Dee has a famous rivalry with Cool J (check out `Death Blow') but this just adds to the amusement, his put down is nothing compared with Ice Cube's infamous, vicious `No Vaseline'.","Old School,Pop Rap,Soul,Pop,East Coast,R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Blues",pay attention last reviews horrable dont even pay attention guy cause sucks busy bee life delivery wise think one best ive ever heard moe dee kept getting doper delivery flawless wish mcs could rap precise crystal clear real treat listen comapared mcs comparison mumble flows switches flows often moving slower paced extremely fast rhyme patterns also excelent choice highly conscious subject matter mixed oldschool braggadocio entertaining dont find beats sparse either oldschool style implementing soul samples nice listen really fan hip hop also think crushed despite media hype fanfare definantly weaker mc dont think moe dee wouldve smashed battle tip delusional thats pay attention reviews pay pay attention attention guy sucks busy busy bee bee life delivery wise think best heard moe dee kept doper delivery flawless wish mcs rap precise crystal crystal clear clear real treat listen mcs comparison mumble flows switches flows paced extremely fast rhyme patterns choice highly conscious subject subject matter matter mixed braggadocio entertaining find beats sparse style implementing soul samples nice listen really fan hip hip hop hop think crushed media media hype hype fanfare weaker mc think moe dee smashed battle tip delusional
197,407,B0000004Y2,"Carolyn really has deversified herself in this album. She starts off the album with the song,&quot;Do What You Do&quot;, in which the guitars had a Sheryl Crow and/or Wynonna Judd growl goin on. Her smooth voice took over  and really harnessed the song well. &quot;New Year's Day&quot; is a  reminder that we all have a chance to start over and new with the Lord.  Starts off sounding like a rockin' Christmas and throughout the song, she  sings like there's no tomorrow! Other highlights are &quot;There You  Are&quot; which is, in my opinion, is a good song to meditate by, pointing  out that the Lord is simply there and there FOR YOU. Other stand-outs would  be &quot;Last Thursday&quot;, which has a VERY catchy beat. It's a  preaching song. Next, we have &quot;Good Thing Going&quot; which is a rock  ballad and it's about confirmation of one's love for her/his mate during  good and bad times. Lastly, there's &quot;Father, Thy Will Be Done&quot;.  This song starts off soft and then it definately picks up and ends up  rockin'.The title of the song speaks for itself. Very upbeat, harmonious  and a very good song to end the album with. Carolyn Arends,once again,has managed to touch people with her attention grabbing lyrics and catchy beat.Ecspecially noteworthy is &quot;Do what you do&quot;which emphasizes how you can't live your life worrying.&quot;Feel  free&quot;is about good friends and Last thursday is a great &quot;this is  how I am and will always be and if you don't like it,so what&quot;kind of  song.Overall I think it's a great CD and a giant leap from her first  album.One thing you can say about her is that she has a style all her own. Forget any Susan Ashton comparisons on this one..now the sound is closer to Sheryl Crow overall but with lyrical depth closer to Aimee Mann. Still pop but the guitar is amped-up and allowed some distortion...in fact, the first thing you hear is squealing guitar to let buyers of I CAN HEAR YOU know this is not the same old Arends. There are distorted vocals at times and the use of drum loops for the first time. This is a complete 180 from the first CD and a much more modern pop sound.Radio rewarded her with 3 hits: #12 ""New Year's Day"", #3 ""Do What You Do"" and #13 ""Big Deal"" but she faded from view immediately afterwards. These days, she still does music as an independent artist.HIGHLIGHTS:""New Year's Day"" examines our failure to follow up on the holiday promises we make. The title track is a blissful, bouncy glockenspiel-dusted paean to honesty to grace with ourselves and fellow believers (""Pray or scream or say or dream anything you want to/To tell me every secret about the ghosts that haunt you/And you can open up your closet wide/There's no skeleton inside/Worse than ones I call my own""). ""There You Are"" reminds us not to wait for a flashy ""burning bush"" or ""parting of the Red Sea"" but notice God's omnipresence among us. ""Do We Dare"" challenges non-Christians about those quiet moments when we wonder if this is really all there is..""the way our hearts beat/ faced with a sunrise/Like maybe they know something we don't"". ""Good Thing Going"" is an ode to her husband of 7 years (with ""no itch"" she notes in the liners). These last 2 are the closest in sound to the mellower pop of her debut.LOWS:In ""Big Deal"" Arends castigates herself for her fears of failure. The song itself is great but the production..specifically cheesy background vocals in the chorus..wrecks it. Re-worked this would become a highlight of the album, but as is, it brings it down.BOTTOM LINE:If you ONLY like softer acoustic-based pop, this probably won't be your cup of tea. It's obvious Arends wanted to bring her sound closer to mainstream pop here and she succeeded. It's vibrant, electric, and modern...without dumbing down the lyrics. Her debut was nice but this is light years ahead of it. Recommended.4 1/2 stars This was a gift for a friend who'd heard one of my Carolyn Arends CDs.  The words are wonderful. I have met Carolyn Arends. She is and awesome person. Feel Free is favorite, in fact so much I sang it with my friend for a talent show and we got a lot of nice comments. Carolyn Arends is one of the many contemporary  Christian singers who has inspired me to go this far with my singing,  playing the piano , and songwriting in great hopes of a muiscal future.  Thanks , Carolyn! God bless all who hear your sweet voice! I reccomend all  her cd's (albums) and if you want to hear more of Carolyn or any other  Contemporary Christian singer listen to 89.3FM KSBJ. Enjoy!!! Carolyn Arends has won me over with Feel Free.  The title tune, &quot;Feel Free&quot; is a great rock tune that returns to your mind again and again. The lyrics on this song and the rest of the album are clever and refreshing to listen to.  &quot;Father Thy Will Be Done&quot; is another song that became an instant favorite.  In this cut Carolyn manages to take what could be considered a simple theme and expand it to an assurance of her faith in the Lord. I can't think of a single song on this album that is not enjoyable.  The rock feel weaves in and out of the selections. I liked this album so much that I snapped up Carolyn's other musical offerings.  Enjoy! Didnt know what to expect when I first picked up this econd release by Carolyn. Thought it would be lesser in sound and song strength. WRONG!! This Cd is even better and is so different from her debut! I love people and artists who change and dont stay the same. The blend oof rock and light jazz and even still just a hint of country on ""Do We Dare"" is brill! This album has some of the best songs ever on it. Listen away to ""Big Deal"" and ""This I know"", they will blow you away. Lovely song about Mark, her hubbie on this Cd although i think ""The day will never come"" on her next one is better but still this song is not flawed! AWESOME KEEP IT UP CAZ! She has a pleasant voice but her song writing leaves a lot to be desired. On this cd she has written only one good song out of ten, and even that is co-written. What has turned it into a great song is outstanding production by Brown Bannister.This song was the beginning and end of my interest in Carolyn. One out of ten is a strike rate that would give you a shelf full of cds you never listen to. But in saying that, if you don't have a copy of ""Do What You Do"", I unreservedly recommend you buy the mp3, and if you like the song as much as I do, you'll then want the better sound quality found on the cd.Then again, with 18 copies of the cd here for a cent at present, maybe that is the way to go first up. I kind of stumbled on this by accident, listened to the Real Audio above, and took a chance.  What a gem!  This album combines riff-driven guitar, folk, and even a bit of country, in a very entertaining way--and I am not a  country or folk listener by any means!  Every song is great.  Carolyn has a  wonderful way with words, a very pretty voice, and her heart is matched  with her sense of humor.  My favorites are the title track, &quot;There You  Are&quot;, &quot;Big Deal&quot;, and &quot;Father Thy Will Be Done&quot;.  I wish that the ride-out of &quot;FTWBD&quot; could go on for another  couple minutes--it is really cool!  I highly recommend this album by this  very talented artist.

198,410,B0000004YL,"I just discovered this cd yesterday.  My uncle gave me this cd to borrow.  I listened to the whole thing twice.  This album is the bomb.  I usually am not a big rap person butI think I'm gonna be.  This is the coolest album  i've heard in a long time. I occasionally listen to Dre and i got some  Eminem, but these guys rap better then those guys any day.  I think the  funniest part/song in this, for me, is the part in Movie Scene where the  fool starts rapping lyrics backwards.  Its pretty cool to hear some new  raps to my ears. FOR THOSE OF US THAT HAVE HEARD FU SCHNICKENS, YOU KNOW YOU'VE STRUCK GOLD. MAD SKILLZ, MAD. TWISTA WOULD HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING UP WITH CHIP, AND THE REST HAVE ALMOST EQUAL SKILLZ. GOOD PRODUCTION, FAT BEATZ. THE OLNY PROBLEM WIT THESE GUYZ IS THE HUMOR. THIS ALBUM WOULD BE ALOT BETTA IF IT WASNT FUNNY AT PARTZ. THE LYRICS ARENT THAT GOOD, (KINDA BAD BEASTIE BOYS) BUT THE WAY THEY DELIVER THEM IS AMAZIN! I WISH THESE GUYS WERE STILL AROUND... WOULD BE HUGE I THINK. This album is from back in the 90's when hip hop was hip hop, not the crap thats out now. If you are looking for a good hip hop album than this is one to add to your collection. This album is hillarious and smooth at the same time. Fu Schnickens wasn't very popular but they had skills that noone these days could ever pull off. These dudes get it in for sure. Another 90's group that put hip hop and not rap im the forefront. These dudes hadcflow and flavor. Phife from ATCQ was on the joint. And this is the group responsible for all of the shaq-fu albums and games. But they made their free throws. I came upon this album almost by accident. I thought the name Fu-Schnickens was funny so I gave a listen and was I glad I did.What I found is that this trio has some of the fastest, smoothest rhymes I have ever heard. I am not the biggest rap fan in the world, but I love this stuff, and these guys do impress.They even rap backwards - double speed on the second track &quot;Movie Scene&quot; which is a funny tribute to hong kong cinema.Their lyrics are intertwined with a ton of references to pop culture like captain caveman. People  aged 25 - 35 will particularly appreciate this.Even though this album is 10 years old now, it's still pretty fresh. I really liked this album.  It was back when you didn't need to be hard, self-absorbed, or constantly talking about money and women.Hip hop is not diverse enough anymore for a group like Fu to have success.  If you want something clever, fast and different to listen to then buy this album.Saying that the current state of hip hop is depressing is by far an understatement.  Buy this album and you'll see a side that doesn't get much expression anymore.The rhymes are interesting and fun to listen to; and you get to see the art of passing the mic mid-verse.  Current hip hop 'stars' aren't skilled enough to make this work anymore.  Nor does that fanbase have the cognitive capabilities to follow it, if it were to be done. don't know what became of these guys but they had a gift and I could see them as players in other acts. To be honest, when I first heard ""Ring The Alarm"" (their 1st single), I didn't like it.  I thought the beat was corny and the video was definitely corny.  So I didn't give these guys the time of day for about 3 or 4 months.  Then I saw the video for ""La Schmoove"" and the beat, though not as hardcore as I would've preferred at the time, was nice and it featured one of my favorite rappers (Phife Dawg).  But that still wasn't enough to sway me.  What did it for me was when I was watching video jukebox (a childhood staple of mine) and I saw the video for ""True Fuschnick"".  The video, in all its black & white, posse vibe glory, was enough for me.  I immediately went and grabbed the album.  I think what immediately jumps out about this album is easily Chip Fu.  I've only heard one person rap faster than Twista (I'm talkin' the old ""Runnin' Off At The Mouth"" Twista too, not that candy b.s that you new jacks are used to).  Chip is that person.  Sometimes it seems like dude just doesn't come up for air.  I personally think his flow is amazing.  Poc Fu is nice too, but in a more gritty, hardcore kind of way.  Moc Fu is just ""eh"" in my book, but he's a more than capable 3rd option that holds his own.  The beats are harder than what I expected given the names in the producer credits -- A Tribe Called Quest (3 tracks), Dres (1 track), Lyvio G. (3 tracks), and Fu Schnickens (3 tracks).  All in all, the songs all thump well and the lyrics are solid.As far as flaws, I would have to say that there really aren't any.  To be honest, there are probably one or two mediocre beats (Check It Out, Bebo), but Chip's flow carries any mediocrity found here.  Also, every now and then Moc Fu will drop a wack line and because the rest of the album is so dope, it sort of magnifies his slip ups.  Otherwise, things are great.  This joint bumps all the way through but the LP is kind of short (10 tracks at just over 43 minutes).  So enjoy the short but sweet format.F.U. Don't Take It Personal is one of the best rap releases from '92.  I think the fact that west coast was becoming a raging monster in the rap game helped make this joint as slept on as it is.

199,411,B0000004YN,"Hi-Five possesses the perfect blend of soul and R&B. This is best experienced on drives to the beach, back-porch house parties, and nights in the city, dancing in the moonlight. Hi-Five is another easygoing-breed quintet with accompanying producers who also did work with Boys II Men, ever present during this era. ""Come and fly with me with me, my love,"" the group expresses on ""Fly Away,"" sending a message of a cry for freedom and love. Their radio hit single is an engaging jam in which the boys profess that ""she's playing hard to get, and she likes me."" ""Quality Time"" is another appealing tune filled with fresh harmonies overlaying a passionate melody. Hi-Five reminds the listener of what it felt like back in the day, reminiscing and realizing that everyone's ""a little bit older now, a little bit wiser now."" Like the first CD the group is strongest with ballads in particular Quality Time, Fly Away and She Said. i've just find out one of my favorite group was in a accidentand i am very sadden about it.i hope that he makes a fullrecovery.we the hi-five need to see more of them on the musicbusiness because the ones that are out dont know nothing aboutlove.so if you dont have there albums you are missing out on alot of true singers. I started with r&b and pop only so I saw this cd online needed it for my own collection,and sex... As I listened to this last night and again today, I couldn't help but smile. This is pure 90s music - you can hear the New Jack Swing and R. Kelly influences (and vocals) throughout.  Fun, danceable, teen angst, feel good music featuring Tony Thompson's above-average teen twang vocals, make this one of the better 90s boy-band CDs.  My only throwaway here is Video Girl, although I do let it play when listening to this CD.  When Tony sings ""Whenever you say, girl"" (Whenever You Say) and ""Girl when my {pager goes off} I'll ignore it baby"" (Quality Time), I believe him!  However, that lyric really does make the song sound dated.Sure, you'll compare these guys to New Edition and Troop, but Hi-Five was in a league of their own.  3.5 stars. One of my favorite songs from this group. I'd purchase the cd simply for this song alone. Very enjoyable listen. This was better than the first. In my opinion this album deserved some awards. ""She's Playing Hard To Get"" ""Quality Time"" ""She Said"" ""Fly Away"" and ""Whenever You Say"" are some of my favorite songs on the album. I still think that this Hi-Five album was the best of the three.  They sounded more mature here as they had to step up their sound a bit.  I still like the funky She's Playing Hard To Get.  But the rest of the album has some surprises.  The four R. Kelly produced songs are solid and I still love Quality Time. Hmmmm....doesn't that song sound like R. Kelly's Sex Me?--identical sounds.  But songs like A Little Bit Older Now, Mary Mary and the funky Video Girl demonstrate their newer image.  I still love Fly Away and how the ballad sounds.  I still play it sometimes.  This was a well done followup and Tony Thompson can sure be SAANGING it at the end of Quality Time and the rest of the album as the lead singer. This album was really great! My favorite song is &quot;Whenever you say&quot;. If you don't have this cd you should definately get it!

200,412,B0000004Z5,"I ordered this CD primarily because it's BILLY OCEAN you can never go wwrong with Billy Ocean this album goes to prove what I just said Billy Ocean comes with outstanding songs on every album LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT Born Leslie Charles in Trinidad in 1950, Billy Ocean had massive R&B and pop chart success in the 80s. This 1993 album, his first proper album since ""Tear Down These Walls"" from 1988, finds him sporting a much different look but still mainly doing the thing that made him famous in the 80s: Caribbean-flavored dance-poppers and a few slow, shimmering ballads. ""The World Wants To Dance"" from this album is particularly good. Overall, not as strong as some of his brilliant 80s works, but definitely more well-made and familiar-sounding than the passage of 5 years might suggest. I got this Album recently because I wanted to get the tracks that R.Kelly did on this set.""Everything's so different without you"" was a decent slow-cut but the Other Kelly Produced track ""Can we go round again"" moved me a bit more.I dug the Sax on that cut.the rest of the Album has some pretty good moments but Billy truly hit His Peak in the very early 80's.still this set has moments. Billy was my man in the 80s'. He was my first favorite R&amp;B artist that  i admired. I loved his music so much and his videos were the jam, and i  went to his concert in Seattle in 1988. He was a great singer and a very  interesting person, and he definitely loves kids. As one of his best fans i  definitely miss his popularity. I do wonder where he is today and i wish  him well whatever he is doing. I always remember his heyday and the love he  expressed in his songs. I also would love to send this brief shout-out to  other Billy Ocean  fans. Never forget about this gentleman. The Caribbean  king of love songs.

201,413,B0000004ZH,"Ant Banks knows how to groove.  How to dig deep into your soul with deep beats.  Im surprised how most other producers concentrate on intricacy and melody over funk because after I was introduced to the Big Bad Ass.  Daz, Dre, Battlecat and all other producers have become null and void to my ears as I feel a insignifigant bounce in there production compared to this man.  This album is no exception.  It has its weak moments such as Spice 1 wit da Banksta (surprise, surprise) but otherwise tracks such as 2 the head, late nite, Roll em phat and hit it, do exactly that.  Its a shame Banks has developed into a more stylistic producer during the 90s but the commercial change is bound to alter hes sound naturally anyway.  This funk is the best that ever was.  More feeling than the present style, deeper than its old skool beginnings and better produced naturally than its originals back in the 70s.  Banks, its a pleasure to be living when your soul is banging hard within mine. Ant Banks has always been one of my favourite producers, hes just got such a skill for funky beats. This Album didnt dissapoint,I was hoping he was going to keep behind the boards and get guest rappers in, but was pleasntly suprised when i heard him rap. Hes much like Dre in the way his flow is uncomplicated, smooth and effective, Again like Dre his real talent lays in his production of beats and loops. This albums is non stop funky beats and funky ryhmes from start to finsh, All the Dangerous Crew make appearnces on here(Too $hort, Spice1, Goldy) and they add to the albums overall feel. Stand out tracks include, 2 tha Head, which is just Banks introducing himself as a rapper over a up-tempo bass heavy groove.Late night F**k is the customery Dangerous Crew sex ryhme, and is as well done as any before it. My favoutie track, is the title track which is just the ultimate party starter, the type it would be pyshicalyy impossible to keep yourself still to. All in all this album is dope. Go get it. Ant Banks is one of the greatest producers in the Bay Area. Comming out from Oakland he worked with local rappers Too $hort and Spice 1 before putting out his solo record. He's a brilliant producer and although his  rapping doesn't match his skills behind the boards, he's a good rapper with  straight-up uncomplicated street lyrics and good flows on the mic. The  beats on the album are hitting and the guest appearences by Spice 1, Too  $hort, Goldy and Pooh-Man are just fabolous and add a lot to the album. Ant  Banks tells the stories about hustlin' on the streets, and in the industry  and also songs about mackin' hoes... A real good album to ride to. A short  one, from the days they prefered short yet quality records over those 20 +  songs albums they put out these days. More like 2 1/2 stars..I know that everyone out in cali loves banks but he really CANT RAP..his beats are ok if you like that style..If you mostly like NY rap you wont like this album..this and spice 1 are very very overrated..their too short rip offs..Dont bother buying this album.. This album is for those who like the too-short sound. The bass lines are non-complicated and the lyrics are in your face street slang. Too-Short pioneered this style and Ant Banks is continuing the tradition.","Gangsta & Hardcore,Pop Rap,Rap & Hip-Hop,West Coast,Pop",ant banks knows groove dig deep soul deep beats im surprised producers concentrate intricacy melody funk introduced big bad ass daz dre battlecat producers become null void ears feel insignifigant bounce production compared man exception weak moments spice wit da banksta surprise surprise otherwise head late nite roll em phat hit exactly shame banks developed stylistic producer commercial change bound alter hes sound naturally anyway funk best ever feeling present style deeper old skool beginnings better produced naturally originals back banks pleasure living soul banging hard within mine ant banks always one favourite producer ant banks banks knows groove dig deep deep soul soul deep beats surprised producers concentrate intricacy melody funk introduced bad bad ass ass dre battlecat producers null void ears feel bounce production compared man exception weak moments spice wit da surprise surprise head late roll em hit exactly shame banks developed stylistic producer commercial change bound alter sound naturally best feeling present style old skool beginnings better produced naturally originals banks pleasure living living soul soul banging hard ant banks banks favourite producer
202,414,B0000004ZL,"I just love this CD!  Every song is just great.  My favorite is the title track, &quot;Feels Like Rain&quot;.  Bonnie Raitt also plays slide guitar on that track.  Other guests on the CD include: Paul Rodger, Bill Payne, Richie Hayward, and even Travis Tritt (on their rendition of John Fogerty's song &quot;Change in the Weather&quot;).  The cut &quot;Country Man&quot;, which was also written by Guy also outstanding!  It would have made an outstanding title track or lead song on this CD, however it was placed last.  I think I now realize why.  Every time the song ends I want to play the CD again, this time a bit louder then the last.I originally bought this on cassette along with DAMB RIGHT, I'VE GOT THE BLUES in 1993, both cassettes are now destroyed with wear but the CDs are crisp and clear. Every track on this album shows why Buddy Guy continues to be a true powerhouse in the Blues Genre. Bonnie Raitt also adds some fantastic vocals and slide guitar on the title track. Feels Like Rain was my introduction to Buddy Guy, and what a fine introduction it is! Altho some blues purists will complain that it isn't ""pure"" blues, and with it's all star cast, a sell-out, but I prefer to look at it as Buddy showing his versatility. From the Stevie Ray Vaughan-sque She's A Superstar, and Feels Like Rain (the smoldering and sensuous cover of the John Hiatt classic), to the red hot finale of Country Man, this to me is a much more consistant album than Damn Right. This CD proves that blues doesn't have to be confined to 12 bar covers of Elmore James and Robert Johnson. And since blues was conceived from slaves easing the pain of their confinement, isn't that what it's all about? More of a mainstream rock record than Guy's first Silvertone album (""Damn Right I've Got The Blues""), and much more so than his third, ""Feels Like Rain"" is not where you go to listen to Buddy Guy the legendary blues guitarist.In fact, this is some of Guy's least blues-oriented material...the only real blues tunes are Muddy Waters's ""She's Nineteen Years Old"" and John Mayall's ""I Could Cry""; the rest of the album is dedicated to rock- and soul covers, blues-rock and pop-rock.The production is rather slick...some more muscle and grit would have been nice, but Guy himself comes off quite well, as you'd expect. His guitar playing is not the best you'll ever hear from him, but his voice is excellent, strong and expressive, and while some of these covers are superflous at best, Guy's rendition of John Hiatt's ""Feels Like Rain"", Ray Charles' ""Mary Ann"", and the soul classic ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" are really enjoyable (the latter is a duet featuring Paul Rodgers of Bad Company).Bonnie Raitt guests on ""Feels Like Rain"", playing bell-clear slide guitar, and the band includes a great pianist, Bill Payne from Little Feat.If you want to hear Buddy Guy play the blues, pick up ""Buddy's Blues"" from MCA/Chess, and Rhino's ""The Very Best Of Buddy Guy"". If you just want a regular feel-good rock record played by a number of better-than-average musicians, well, you'll probably like this just fine. So, depending on what you're looking for, this is either a nice, well-executed rock record, or a wishy-washy middle-of-the-road piece of pandering ;-) A nice album from the legendary Buddy Guy, Feels Like Rain is about as straight forward as it gets.  A strong set of electric blues, served up with a heapin' side of boogie, the album plays out as an old blues man just havin' a great time makin' music. Do you feel just a little bit  weary and edgy? Maybe a little snappy?  I heard it called &quot;assertive&quot; on  television.  Does your voice get a little  bit hoarse on Saturday night?  I mean assertive.Well anyway you have to get Buddy, then. I love to listen to all different types of music and after my son saw Buddy Guy in Denver and said he thought the concert rocked I decided to get a couple of CD's and listen. Very nice! To me this is Buddy Guy's best CD overall. I am coming from the viewpoint of a recording engineer, music producer, and musician and not a blues purist. These songs are mixed really well. You can hear all of the instruments and his vocals are excellent and upfront. You can hear Buddy's guitar solos cleary but he doesn't overplay as I believe he does in many of his recordings. He has paid more attention on the delivery and presentation of the songs first,....and his solos don't overpower but are still dynamite. I grow tired of listening to some of Buddy's other recordings and the same old blues chord progressions. ""Feels Like Rain"" is different and the songs are varied with rhythm patterns, chord progressions, and time sequences. This CD never grows old for me and I can listen to it over and over again. Not true for some of his others. I also like ""Living Proof"" and 'Slippin In"" for the same reasons although the songs have more of a blues rock feel. I have listened to DJ Play My Blues, Definitive Buddy Guy, Slipping In, and Living Proof. Is Buddy really 74 or is he now older? Eric Clapton called him the greatest guitar player on the planet and I believe it. Buddy Guy. One of my favorites. Picked up this one and it is fast becoming one of my favorites. I'm not a blues purist. I like the Southern Soul and this fits right in there. Some Kind Of Wonderful. Wow! Change In The Weather. Wow! A little taste of Ray Charles. A little taste of Muddy Waters. That's what the blues is all about. Feels Like Rain! If you like Blues-Rock you will like this album.  But for Hard core Texas\Chicago sounds steer clear.  Better albums: (1) Damn Right (2) Heavy Love (3) Steppin In  -- all of these are better albums. Well the price is as good as it gets and the music of the master Buddy Guy. Great combo. I highly recommend this. This album is a good choice for the blues fan who resides with a non-blues fan.  It's not as coarse or raw as some of his other stuff(which I also love), but still retains enough of his edge to keep me interested.  He clearly concentrated more time on his vocal stylings as opposed to his guitar licks.  Some tracks sound a bit over-produced and lose some atmosphere as a result.  Other than that, it's a fun album that is worth picking up.","Chicago Blues,Regional Blues,Pop,Electric Blues,Modern Blues,Contemporary Blues,Blues",love cd every great favorite title quot feels like rain quot bonnie raitt also plays slide guitar guests cd include paul rodger bill payne richie hayward even travis tritt rendition john fogertys quot change weather quot cut quot country man quot also written guy also outstanding would made outstanding title lead cd however placed last think realize every time ends want play cd time bit louder last originally bought cassette along damb right ive got blues cassettes destroyed wear cds crisp clear every shows buddy guy continues true powerhouse blues genre bonnie raitt also adds fantastic vocals slide guitar title feels like rain introduction buddy guy love cd great favorite title quot feels feels like feels like rain like rain quot bonnie bonnie raitt raitt plays slide slide guitar guitar guests cd include bill bill payne payne richie richie hayward travis tritt tritt rendition john quot change weather cut quot country country man man quot written guy outstanding outstanding title lead cd placed think realize time ends want play cd time bit originally bought cassette right got blues cassettes destroyed wear cds crisp clear shows buddy buddy guy guy continues true powerhouse blues bonnie bonnie raitt raitt adds fantastic vocals slide slide guitar guitar title feels feels like feels like rain like rain introduction buddy buddy guy guy
203,415,B000000506,"Heavy bass, moody melodies and very energetic flows make this one of the best west coast hip hop albums ever made.I can go on about how hip-hop these days is nothing compared this, but I'll save your time since that's a well known fact by now. '93 til Infinity' still hits me like new....The quality of music on this album stands the test of time and still bangs today.....The title track is still on of my fav hip hop tracks of all time....""that where ya lost"" is another classic cut on here as well....Overall this is a must have for aspiring mc's or for this hip hop fans that appreciate highly skilled mc's....Everyone comes ill on this album In the heart of true California underground hip hop, Souls of Mischief  delivers huge.  They have a genuine style that you can catagorize, but  still it's completely fresh.  I applaude them for moving into the  mainstream, yet still holding on to their raw style. The groups bouncing  banter and feelgood jams keep this album at the top.  And if I can just  take a moment to give special props to Phesto, who I think is one of the  most underrated MCs in the biz.  Keep it up Phesto. These guys from Oakland, California are a big part of the west coast underground. Just because their from Cali, please don't think there style is west Coast. The track &quot; That's when you lost&quot; has one of the  illest hook and sample I have EVER heard. This CD always stay in eye view  in my collection of Hip-Hop joints. All of the tracks are tight including  &quot;Live and let live&quot; and &quot;Disseshowedo&quot;.oNe This record is probably about as solid as 2000's &quot;Trilogy,&quot; and &quot;Deltron 3030&quot; or 1998's &quot;Third Eye Vision&quot; but within the context of its time it is quite possibly the best hip-hop record ever made.  After some very promising releases from Del including &quot;I Wish my Brother George was Here&quot; and &quot;No Need for Alarm,&quot; Souls took Hiero to a new level with &quot;'93 til Infinity.&quot;  This was my personal introduction to Hieroglyphics and I have been an avid fan ever since.  The production and lyrics are unmatched for originality and innovation in hip hop, not even by pioneers like Run DMC, EPMD, or Rakim.  Playing the title of this record is like adding twenty decibels to a party, and ten to your car, and there are a number of gems (&quot;Anything Can Happen&quot; is my personal favorite) elsewhere on the album.  In fact, it is pretty much top to bottom solid. This record is a hip hop classic and a must own. WAY BEFORE IT'S TIME. A most hve in your collection I think. The only sad thing is it came out almost 10yrs early for people to feel them. EXCEPT US TRUE HIP HOP HEADS In my opinion, Hieroglyphics is the most talented crew I've come across, save for Wu-Tang Clan.  With Del, Souls of Mischief, and Casual (the main heavy hitters), you have a very formidable team to contend with.  Now, this album is a classic - you have to remember, the West Coast sound back in the early 90's was mostly funkdafied stuff.  To hear the Souls flow, lyrics, and content at that time, especially coming out of Cali, was something very different.  The biggest hit of this album, '93 Til Infinity' is truly one of the most addictive songs in hip hop history.  As an album, '93' is very consistent.  The Hiero sound was surging at this point, the production and lyrics are in such a thematical sync that the result is a distinct feeling throughout the album.  My personal favorites include 'Live and Let Live' (A Plus really killed the last verse - Thou shall not kill, I will if I have to...), 'That's When You Lost' (freestyle topics over an ill beat), '93 Til Infinity' (really catchy, feel good song), and 'Anything Can Happen' (very intricate revenge story told).  I would have to say this album is one of my Top 5 of all time.  Lyrics, beats, execution are all there.  Every song is a burner, a social conciousness definitely permeates through the album; Hieroglphics is one of the most cutting edge, innovative groups that hip hop has ever seen.  I think '93' can be appreciated more nowadays, as hip hop has expanded as a world wide phenomena.  I mean, being from New York and listening to this album when it first came out (with the likes of Black Moon, Wu-Tang, Biggie, and Nas coming out), not too many people out here gave it a listen.  This is a true jewel of hip hop, you should definitely give it some flight-time. Wow, what can be said about this album other than that it is f***ing raw. Tajai, A+, Opio, and Phesto D all rip it on every track. The chemistry they have seamless.  Add ontop of that Domino, Del, Jay Biz, and A+ lacing the Souls with some of the most lovely beats that they have dropped in thier respective careers, and you have one fine piece of hip hop.  Not one weak track at all, and the spirited, in your face style of the Souls makes for great listening anytime.  This is a boom-bap classic and one of the best albums from the Hieroglyphics cliq. Timeless is the best way I can describe this album. A-Plus, Opio, Phesto, and Tajai with flows like rivers just tear up every beat. Every song on here is good. Some of the jazziest beats around mixed with some of the smoothest rhymes around makes for a timeless classic.A must for any true fan of the genre. Every track is solid. The beats were way ahead of its time, needs to be a five star album. Peace Souls Of Mischief's debut album '93 'Til Infinity set the tone for years to come from this group, its members, and their Hieroglyphics crew.  Members A-Plus, Opio, Phesto and Tajai hailing from Oakland, California giving lyrics and intuitiveness back to hip-hop/rap.  Three songs produced by member A-Plus that gives a sense of the group having to take control of their own destiny with ""Never No More"", the title track and ""Anything Can Happen"".  All but ""Make Your Mind Up"" contains all four members.  ""Batting Practice"" is not practice what so ever, but a display of skills of the Souls.  As they all team up on sharing verses on ""Disseshowedo"" its more than apparent that Souls Of Mischiefis noteworthy of their talents and ability to feed off one another.  This is not commercial, this is not mainstream, this is hip-hop!  No additives, no preservatives.  Just 14 tracks of good music. this album helped me convert a lot of people who 'liked any music except  rap'. souls' diverse flows, college-educated lyrics and head-bobbing tracks  made me thank whatever gods there are for hip hop music. this is why i  listen--for songs that i can play over months and years, still hearing new  things, still being inspired. hip hop seems to have de-evolved in the last  few years, but albums like this one are a welcome diversion from the  glittery face of rap in 2G. Hiero is the wu-tang of the west coast- the souls keep up the hiero tradition with '93 till.. If you like REAL hip hop, like Third eye vision or any other hiero this is for you. Other groups I listen to (if you like any of them '93 till infinity is for you) 'Licks, Saafir, Tribe, Gang Star, Commen Sense, Beetnuts, outkast, Fugees, and the Roots. Very frist CD I've Picked Up from the Hiero fam, and I got to say that I loved most of it. Souls Of Mischief (A Plus, Tajai, Opio, and Phesto)debut ""93 'Til Infinity"" has placed a mark on the year 1993 of hip hop.Tracks like ""That's When Ya Lost"" lets you know this group is not all about games, and not to be messed with. If you haven't realized, the tracks ""Let 'Em Know"" & ""Disseshowedo"" features samples from Main Source's ""Faking The Funk"". The song ""Never No More"" has a dark type beat that was produced my A-Plus. The self titled hit, ""93 'Til Infinity"" the major standout and the most rememberable track of the CD(Fun fact: that song was actually written in 1991 but was changed). ""Limitations"" is a fast paced song that features a hook from Del and a verse from Casual telling many rappers that they have their limits. ""Batting Practice"" is a loud song with the hook shouting ""I have a Hieroglyphics baseball bat..."" The ""Outro"" is some shout outs (remember when rappers did these) letting S.O.M. and Hiero fans that they have more to come.I believe this group of 4 has done a good job with their debut CD, with production by Hiero's own: Del, A-Plus, Casual, Domino, and Jay Biz. This is an album I recommend to any Hiero fan, new and old, because like many said, they will love to hear it from 93 Til Infinty!Standout tracks: Let 'Em Know, Thats When Ya Lost, 93 'Till Infinity, Batting Practice I bought this CD seven years ago and fell in love with the groups original style of Hip HOP.  It's a breath of fresh air from the gangsta rap monotony that has crowded the airwaves for way to long.  From the beats to the lyrics this is one the best CD's that I have ever purchased. Definatly a classic They sound like A Tribe Called Quest in there prime this could literally be called Midnight Marauders West. Luckily for them there lyrical prowless does not sound like ATCQ. The Lyrics are edgy and they are more harsher vocals. The beats are first rate and there is higgh spirits. Even if you don't like the CD you will get up and dance insanely because it is so good.""Live and Let Die"" is a sing song swaying of just absolute brilliance.""Name I call my self"" is yet another top highlight and the very heartbreaking ""93 til Infinity"" because you want to be back in 93 even if you don't remember it. IT has it's place in time and in the eyes of Souls of Mischief it will always be 1993.Lyrics 10  Production  10  Replay  10  Entertainment  10 I bought this for my brother sometimes I listened to it myself and I ended up downloading from it. I like it. This CD is amazing. Great flow and rhymes with jazzy beats and samples. These guys know what their doing but this is when they where just kids and know their all grown up and can rip [stuff] like you wouldn't belive. A must get for a hip hop fan. Also check out 3rd Eye Vision by Hieroglyphics crew if you enjoy this. Thats when these guys show you what hip hop is all about but get this first cuz its god damn good This is one of the all-time best hip-hop albums ever brought into existence.  It is a crime shame that at the time of this posting, the album has only 4.5 stars.The beats - funky, groovy, bassheavy, beautiful. The rhymes - groovy, creative, seamless, precise, flowing like wind. Everything about this album is 6/5. SOM til infinity! Oh man, this album is so dope. It's my favorite of all time. Every track is DOPE AS F*CK. The lyrics and beats are so great. Favorite tracks are - ofcourse '93 Til Infinity - and Make Your Mind Up. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS YET, BUY IT A.S.A.P.! Souls of Mischief's ""93 Til Infinity"" is a very consistent and overall excellent hip hop album. Throughout its 54 great minutes, the excellent production and rapping remain constant. SOM's four MCs (A-Plus, Phesto, Tajai, and Opio) are very compelling because there are so many sides to their characters. They are intelligent, literate lyricists, yet have experienced the streets of East Oakland and know how to have fun. Throughout the 14 tracks, they philosophize, tell stories, and explore many ideas. The beats are excellent, using funky basslines and jazz horns for a great jazz-rap record. ""93 Til' Infinity"" is probably so overlooked because it was conceptually similar to more popular alternative groups like A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and Black Moon, but ""93 'Til"" stacks up as a near flawless album worthy of any hip hop collection.""Let 'Em Know"" begins the album excellently, with great lyrics and a beat with driving bass and a sax loop. ""Live and Let Live"" is among the best tracks, with lyrics discussing varying philosophies on life and one of the best beats on the record, with nice bass, piano, and trumpet. On ""That's When Ya Lost"", Tajai and the crew bash sucker MCs over more head bobbing bass. ""A Name I Call Myself"" has a beat reminiscent of ATCQ and lyrics that explore the Souls of Mischief's characters. After the fun ""Disseshowedo"" is the great ""What A Way to Go Out"", which tells stories about violence and failure in a funny and positive light. ""Never No More"" is based around a jazz trumpet loop and on-point verses. The title track ""93 Til Infinity"" is one of the greatest hip hop songs of all time and would make the album worth it alone. The vibesy, deep beat with horns and great instrumental is perfect, and the lyrics go everywhere, it's a very peaceful and beautiful song. It's followed by ""Limitations"", which warns MCs to know them, and ""Anything Can Happen"", a pretty gritty song for SOM. ""Make Your Mind Up"" is expertly produced, as is the top-notch ""Batting Practice"", a Hieroglyphics anthem. ""Tell Me Who Profits"" warns potential criminals against shady business, and the classic outro finishes the album.""93 Til Infinity"" is a great album that fuses west coast hip hop with the east coast mentality of 1993. The Souls of Mischief had a masterpiece in this album and I recommend it to all fans of early 90s jazzy hip hop, because it is among the best of the genre. When I heard this album for the first time two years ago, I didn't like it much at all. The styles were too different for me, and I thought the Souls had odd voices. But certain tracks ('93 'til Infinity' and 'A Name I Call Myself') would stick in my head and force me to listen to them. Slowly, more rhymes would stick in my head and grow on me. Now the album is my favourite of all time and 93 til Infinity is my favourite song.The Souls twist your mind with effortless flows with excellent multisyllabic rhyme schemes which are still not often paralleled today. You'll find nobody outside of Hieroglyphics who had styles as different and advanced as this back in '93. Unfortunately they changed their styles after this album (and after almost every other album they have dropped) and never came back to this method of rhyming. The album is mostly comprised of creative, innovative battle rhymes. The beats are mostly upbeat and jazz-inspired.While this is my favourite album, I wouldn't call it the best Hiphop album ever. That honour goes to Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle. But this one will always be my favourite. My favourite tracks are '93 'til Infinity', 'Let 'Em Know', 'A Name I Call Myself' and 'What A Way To Go Out'.This album is definitely worth having, or at least listening to. If the rhyme schemes aren't too unconventional for you, you'll probably love it. This record changed my life.It is the greatest hip-hop album ever  made.If not the greatest album period.If you buy it you won't regret  it.If you don't, you will.Seven years on and nothing has come  close.Buy it already. This is just another classic from the &#34;Golden Age&#34; of hip-hop.  I don't think I would ever voluntarily get rid of this disc. When talking of the WestCoast Rap Scene most people only think of NWA & The Deathrow scene while most people over look the class act that these lyrical rhyme slayers were back when California was just getting a foot in a scene that was already dominated by the entire east coast sound but thanks to these guys Califronia would too also get recognition an get a foot in the door which later would later be dominated by something more layback an gangsta when it was thought that only the NewYork Scence could produce lyrical cat in the hat rhyme slayers when the west had its own lyrical master minds which these dudes where with this super dope album worth every cent When this Ablum came out IN '93 a whole lot of people were into the gansta Rap state of mind.. But I recall picking up this ablum and blasting it im my college dorm room to counter all that crap I heard back then and hey lets face it even now..Many gems on this album but a 4 star rating is not in effect here because they were young then and it shows..but i fell in love with &quot;'93 till infinity&quot; and i killed all that whack ish --mentallyGet it got it..Good for you Souls of Mischief's 93 Til' Infinity still remains an underappreciated classic within the hip hop community. Adopting a style similar to the Pharcyde, the jazzy beats and laid back rhymes are a surprising alternate from California's g-funk. As part of the hieroglyphs, a hip hop group that also included Del the Funky Homosapien, Souls of Mischief proved that alternate rap was not simply an east coast phenomenon.Fans of Tribe Called Quest, Pharcyde, and Digable Planets will like this album. From the atmospherical 93 Til' Infinity to the relaxed Never No More, 93 Til' Infinity is a great album to kick back and relax to. On top of it all, all four members(A-Plus, Opio, Phesto D and Tajai)have a natural flow and are each great lyrically. This album is a buy for any hip hop head. These guys impress me. . .all of the emcees in Souls of Mischeif have so much charisma that their unique voices alone are enough to do the beats justice. . .but their lyrics are amazing. They go from brag raps in &quot;A name I call myself&quot;, to putting down wacker emcees on tracks like &quot;Limitations&quot;. The figures of speech they use in their ryhmes are completely unorthodox and always leave you wondering about what they will say next. All of this is going on over flawless beats. Most of the tracks have a dark 1993 feel about them. . .the bass is raw but there are also some delicate melodys in a few of them in particular. &quot;Live and Let Live&quot; has a very classy saxaphone and piano. Something else I noticed which I'm sure not many other hiphop heads noticed was the piano in &quot;Tell me Who Profits&quot;. . .it is the same piano in Jay-z's &quot;Coming of Age&quot; which he made three years later in his &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; album. This is from the days when you had to be good to grab a mic. Lyrical wizardry was the order of the day, if you had no skillz you stayed away from the mic. The production is as tight as the lyrics on this album both were made for each other. BUY THIS!!!!!!!! Wow I cant belive it is almost 2005 and this album still sounds good. I love these guys they just make you bump your head where can you start on this album I guess LET EM KNOW the beat is slamming, just listen to it at the end butter. Thats when you lost another favorite of mine, smoking on that crack rock thats when you lost lol classic. 93 till infinity is a all time classic hip hop cut it is what opened up the world to these Oakland kids, they sound like they are haveing so much fun which hip hop should be about and if you have not seen the video then you have missed out. Batting practise is like an all out posse cut its like this yall its like that yall i got a heiro baseball bat yall lol. I say this is the best stuff they have put out. I still would say support them they do have a web site also so check that out. One of the BEST Records HIP HOP has to offer. The chemistry between all the MC's is great. Each MC is building off each others styles to form just amazing work. Backed by legendary production. (Beats that meet all expectations) You'd be very grateful to include this album in your next purchase. Peace... Like many people - I will never forget hearing this for the first time when I was a sophmore in high school.It has been 12 years, and it is still the best rap album , hands down. It's really amazing when you think about it - nothing has come close.It's a shame that their follow-up albums didn't even come close - although I don't blame them , who the hell could ever come close to this album??? Even THEY can't !!!! Truly a hip hop classic. If you enjoy other intelligent hip hop like Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, The Roots or Little Brother you'll love this album. This album is a must have classic. If this is not in your collection then u need to go get it. Even though it was made in the early 90's it has such a fresh feel to it while obviously keeping an old school vibe. A-Plus, Phesto, Opio, and Tajai are some of the sickest cats in the game and its very apparent in the sick flows that lace this whole entire album. 93 Till Infinity is probably one of the most slept on rap albums from the 90's. Souls of Mischief who also formed Heiroglyphics have a very unique sound. The hit song ""93 Till Infinity is one of the greatest rap songs ever. This album cam out twelve year ago, if you don't have it what are you waiting for. The production is incredible and the rhymes are creative and different. They don't gang bang and talk about money and clothes, they actually have something to say without getting preachy. In the end this album has thirteen tracks of really good music and any real hip hop fan definately needs to add this album to his rap library. This is a classic. Every track on the album kills; they shut it down. If you're looking for some true hip hop jazz this is where its at. This 1993 debut by souls of mischief was a rare gem released during the gangsta rap era. These talented rappers (A-plus, Opio, Tajai & Phesto) from the hip hop crew Hieroglyphics released an under-rated classic. Although the quality of the production would be considered primitive to today's standards, the album is not effected by this. Each song is ... Kickin'! This CD takes me back to my late Junior high/ early High school days. My favorite tracks on this album are ""That's when ya lost"", ""A name I call myself"",""93 'tilinfinity"" , ""Limitations"", ""Anything can happen' & ""Make up your Mind"". This album is for Hiero fans and rap fans who remember the days when rap wasn't all about fake commercial clowns inventing a false criminal history to push their ""thug"" image and bragging about how rich they are when they know half their jewlery is rented. Although this album takes you back, it is no less enjoyable for today's hiphop lovers. &quot;'93 Till Infinity&quot; pretty much sums up all the beauty of my college years. I hear five seconds of this track and I'm right back there. The lyrics ARE pretty misogynistic, but hey. I've learned to ignore objectionable words in great music. I'd rather disregard my personal opinions ... to miss out on the music would defeat my purpose in being alive! Just doin my bit for a five star average. Peace First and foremost this album iz hot!  I recommend it to any hip-hop head any day of the week.  Why did SOULS OF MISCHIEF get slept on?  Unfortunately they debuted (1993) at a time when gangsta rap was takin' off and takin' ova. (boo)  And at a time when the classic sound of hip-hop was movin on. (so sad)  That, combined with a sound similar to Cali-mates THE PHARCYDE who debuted a year earlier and a little POOR RIGHTEOUS TEACHERS (1990) flava probably lead to the obscurity that kept these kids from hittin' and gettin' the recognition they deserved.  Hope they continue to get some recognition on the air-waves, digital-waves, microwaves...and gain a stronger following!  Nuff Respect.Sincerely,Dr. Smart Sista hot to death, raw and fresh for 93 and forever. Dare I say it? Best hip hop record of the year. Maybe. But '93 is sure as hell a hiero year. With DEL dropping his classic &quot;No Need for Alarm&quot;, this was a Hiero year. This is as raw as west coast hip hop got (well Aceyalone, freestyle fellowship, del, casual and blackalicious) are there too, but this is still supernatural. Four young, hungry, freestyle fanatics/MC's rip on mics, wack rappers with just perfect smooth beats at one and hardcore at another moment. This is seriously a no-skip LP so there are no standout songs. Simple: just go out and cop it!!! Hardly gets better!! '93 'TIL INFINITY!!!!!!!! This is an example of the fine underground hip hop which the West Coast has been producing for ten years now (More than that, and can it be considered underground if you can buy it on Amazon.com?). The production value on this album is honestly dated today, but that doesn't stop incredibly illacious rhymes and VERY VERY tight beats from shining through. If this album was produced by Def Jam in 2002 with some better producers (No offense to Hieroglyphics producers, they did what they could with what they could) it would be one of the top ten albums of all time. A lot of times the beats are too loud for some of the soft spoken MCS which comprise SOM. This is their best studio album, I highly recommend digging up some of their underground tapes as they comprise samples which they couldn't get the rights to (Cab Fare, which is backed by the theme from Taxi is one of the hottest cuts I've EVER heard in over 15 years of being into true hip hop). This album hit soooooo hard in 1993!!! I had just started school at Clark in Ga. when this album came out. I had already knew of SOM cause I am from the Bay. In '93, that westcoast eastcrap was already in full effect, Clark was kinda a microcosim of that....You had so many cats from Cali and from NY all going to the same school, but it was all family though. We just all debated how ""our"" music was the dopest. Wu had just hit, Black Moon hit, Too Short(mack rappin seem so popular now but he was the innovator and no one can't touch right now)...and then the Chronic hit!!! Dang!!Chronic was monumental and influential...But when SOM hit with '93 til infity Every body was in agreement. This album was so influential on so many levels. For one the Bay was alwasy known for hustle and playa rap, But if you are not from the Bay then you would not know that one of the most thriving underground hip hop cultures exists there and what souls of mischief represented was just that. In the Bay Area are music preferance are so varied, The Bay Area has just always been a muscially diverse region. There is not that closed mindedness of one type of rap or rap style that was so prevalent in ny in the early '90's, forutnately that mindset has mature. But anyways. SOMS was just a surprised, nobody expected or ever heard of them, but people from the Bay was like ""yeah they tight""...LOL.. the Hyro crew in general is AMAZING...if you can catch their show, you will enjoy it. Man I used to listen to this album to get me in my study mode, it just excited my brain...SOM...keep it movin'!!! Yo, I thought this was a tight CD, it had all this tight gangster stuff that was straight up keepin' it real up in here.Man, this is one of those dope CD's that just bites you in da face and say's straight up, yo. Man if your a straight -up ghetto, hard-core gangsta rapper tryin' to produce some rap up in your nieghborhood like me, you should keep it real and buy this dope record.This dope CD Gives me STRAIGHT-UP strength to just throw down some dope lyrics for everybody in red bluff.I'm out, so keep it real. The case was a little wacky, but overall it's a win. How can I complain about a hard copy of 93 'til. Legendary. Although this album was released in 1993, it still sounds fresh today. Souls Of Mischief created a classic with 93 Til' Infinity setting the stage for future Hieroglyphics material. The four young MC's possessed amazing, rapid-fire wordplay that nobody else could duplicate. It flowed together well, and the lyrics were intelligent, funny, and clever. Never once did the Souls resort to the tired &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;gangsta&quot; cliches and trends that were becoming popular at the time. And the production here is fantastic also with work from the Souls themselves as well as Del, Domino, and others. Check &quot;Let 'Em Know&quot;, &quot;Make Your Mind Up&quot;, &quot;Tell Me Who Profits&quot;, and the title cut. The Souls were never able to duplicate this album, but that would be an extremely hard, almost impossible task. If you are a fan of hip-hop, you must own this. Even if you're not a big fan of hip-hop, give this a listen. this cd is dope undergorund i dont know why heiroglyphics dont make like a video that gets them i rap city and same for the four horsemen and canibus they should make videos the would go on rap city in the basement or at least on uncut they would push more units create more real hip hop lovers and still have a street cred or respect from heds all around the world anyways check out the cdFavorite Track:'93 Til InfinityGuests: Del The Funky Homosapian10 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats i dont like this cd havin a 4 1/2 star average, im just doing my part to raise it back up to 5 stars, because this is a 5 star cd 93 'Til Infinity (Jive/Zomba 1993)Del Tha Funkee Homosapien had already breaked through in 1991 with I Wish My Brother George Was Here, but it was first when Souls Of Mischief released their genius debut, 93 `Til Infinity, we started takin' Hieroglyphics seriously. They showed us that rap from the Bay Area is more than just Too Short and Spice 1, and this record is on the same level as the best from New York.It's not easy to point the finger at it. Sometimes just everything flaps, and Sould Of Mischief did absolutely everything right on this album. With good help from the rest of Hieroglyphics, they already had a timeright and comfortable sound, with lots of jazzsamples (Ramsey Lewis, Monk Higging, etc.) and vocal cuts. The dynamic interaction between four hungry rappers assured that this never became boring, and they was impressively good with both flows and punchlines (""I flip the script like dyslexic actor""). A-Plus, who was in college at the time, took a leaderrole in the group. He also produced three of the best songs here, like the nice titletrack. Other highlights are the single ""That's When Ya Lost"", ""Make Your Mind Up"" and of course ""Live And Let Live"", where producer Domino adds a melancholic live trumpet. Actually every songs on 93 `Til Infinity are worth a listen. No reason to skip anything.This set marked the start for the Hiero-movement, and in short time we got excellent albums both from Del, Casual and Extra Profilic. In 1993 hip-hop was still in it's prime, and creativity was highly ranked rather than bad salesgimmicks. The Oakland rappers A-Plus, Opio, Phesto and Tajai only made their debut, but 93 `Til Infinity ended up being in my and many others opinion as a timeless classic. Whew what to say about a CD that changed your taste in hip-hop? From the opening bass line and vocal scratches of Let 'em Know I was in love. This bridged the gap between peace rap (De La Soul, Native Tongues) and gangsta rap (Eazy-E, Notorious B.I.G.)And it did it in style. Over funky break beats they made songs about the never ending cycle of gang violence in Live and Let Die. They have a song about beating people with bats. It's just classic. This is an underground hip hop heads NWA. Instead of the syntheseiser they used a funky bass line and a speedy drum loop. The lyrics are brilliant, however sometimes vocal quality becomes a problem because the bass is very loud. Best track on the CD, Live and Let Die. Some horrible schmuck kids on the 81st block of Brooklyn Park just north of Minneapolis MN broke into my car a few years ago and stole one of my favorite hip hop cds.  I had met Del the funky homosapien (yes I know he isn't in this group, per se) on Hennepin in MPLS before a Hieroglyphics show, and he was cool enough to sign this disc.  Then after they rocked the friggin house (1st ave) I met Casual and Pep Love.  My friends and I hung out with them and they also signed this disc.  This crew is first rate hip hop.  There is nothing being made today even remotely as cool as 93 til infinity.  If you love GOOD hip hop, do not hesitate to buy this CD.  It rules.  But know if it is signed to Sam, it was stolen from someone who knows better than to take what is not his.  One Love! if u really a true hip hop head then you got this album it is essential to any hip hop collection Anyone who knows hip-hop knows for a fact that this album is one of hip-hop's true gems.Back in the day, this debut release from SOM helped break me into good hip-hop.  From &quot;Let 'em Know&quot; to the Outro, this album contains nothing but pure, untainted hip-hop.  SOM (A-Plus, Opio, Phesto &amp; Tajai) posess such talent and chemistry with each other on the mic.  Every track is amazing and every track is unique.  They can be serious (real), threatening, full of themselves, funny and whatever they rhyme about, they do it to perfection.  &quot;93 'til Infinity&quot; is 13 tracks of dirty beats, creative lyrics and flows like you've never heard before.  Listening to SOM rap is like a lyrical headbobbing rollercoaster.  Nobody can rip a mic like SOM and every crew in the game knows it.&quot;Anything Can Happen&quot; (track #10) is one of the most captivating storytelling tracks I've ever heard to this day.  A story of revenge over a ear chilling beat.&quot;A Name I Call Myself&quot; (#4) justifies why SOM is the sh*t.&quot;That's When Ya Lost&quot; (#3) shows you why SOM isn't to be f***ed with.I'm just showing that each and every track is unique and is actually about something.  Each theme is different from the next, this whole album is bursting with creativity.  Pretty much, if you liked the groundbreaking single, &quot;93 'til Infinity&quot; (#8) then you'll love the entire album.Production is done by Hiero crew members Domino, Del, A-Plus, Casual &amp; Jay-Biz.  The beats are all so creative and innovative, the dirty beats and the amazing rhyming will blow your mind.***Mad props to Del Tha Funkee Homosapien; without him Souls of Mischief would not exist.  Del gets in on track #9 &quot;Limitations&quot;***Bottom Line:  I've listened to this LP hundreds of times and it keeps getting better.  The title is perfect because hip-hop heads will be rockin' this album literally from '93 all the way to infinity.  A perfect 5 stars.  Peace. 93 til infinity was a Classic Album That Was The Sign along with (del's solo) Of many Great Albums To Come By The Hierogylpic Crew Now If You Grew Up In The Bay Like Me This Album Was Heavily Loved By The Underground And Is Still Celebrated Today....Classic Way To Put It Down For The Bay Homies Big Ups and Much Respect!! If You Like Souls Of Mischief give this guy a listen:Consider This...Your Final Warning!!! [Explicit] this is one of the greatest rap albums ever..str8 classic..ive listened to it thousands and thousands of times and it still sounds fresh today..at only 18 the souls of mischief's skills are mind blowing..and with with deep bass lines and blaring horns the beats are outstanding..simply a must have album..timeless I had not listened to this album for a long time until a couple of days ago.  I was blown out of my seat.  I had forgotten what a great album this is. All the songs are good, excellent production, terrific MCing, great  beats, this is just a great album.  I think this is easily one of the most  slept on hip-hop albums ever and is one of the best rap albums of the 90s.  This album is right up there with Enter the Wu Tang, The Chronic, Enta Da  Stage, 21 &amp; Over, and all the other great albums of the 90s. Dis album Sukz cause there is only one good song on it. Tha only good song on dis BAd album is 93 till infinity. The Rest of the songs suk. aaaaaa!!.This is one of the best albums of 1993 (Second best year for hiphop), that will leave true hiphop fans speechless. Tajai, Opio,A-plus & Phesto D make up Souls of Mischief, and with this album proved just why they are considered the best in the Westcoast underground, along with the main group; Hieroglyphics. Sooo much character!, without a doubt, this album just epitomises everything good about Early 90's hiphop. Every single track is flawless, and each has it's own individuality about it that enables you to rememeber each track for its own brilliance. From the compelling flows, indescribable beats & creative lyrics, there is no way that SOM can not satisfy any Hiphop's fans needs. From when the journey kicks off at ""Let Em Know"", all the way through to the outro, you can bet that their will not be one moment that'll make you even want to reach for the remote, it just aint happening. 93 'til infinity is sraight consistency. Now, peak this if you appreciate underground, or early-mid90's hiphop because this will be one of your favourites, without a doubt. Now, go buy a copy or whatever way you can to obtain this ish, because you will find it was one the best decisions you ever made. DO NOT SLEEP...get to know. PEACE. This is how hiphop should be...Best Tracks - TOO HARD TO DECIDE!! HONESTLY, EVERY SINGLE ONE IS JUST RIDICULOUS!Lyrics - 10/10Beats - 10/10Originality - 10/10Replay Value - 10/10If you found this helpful, check my other reviews I've had this CD since it first hit the streets and it's nothing short of hiphop's dopest moment.  If it were to have been put off and released today in '99, it would still beat everything that's going on with hiphop now with  the only exception maybe being Solesides/Quannum, whom Hiero's tight with  anyway.  '93 til infinite describes this album's longevity perfectly -  peace i think this is one of the best cds ive ever got. the sound is different and i like it You idiots must listen to some stupid crap like lil Wayne...

204,416,B000000509,"WHO NEEDS COMMERCIAL APPEAL?  THE TEACHER WILL BE HERE FOR EVER!  Consistantly demonstrating that he is HIP-HOP, KRS proves it from track to track.  I've owned this C.D. since it first came out, and I can say this;  From KRS-One ATTACKS, to HIGHER LEVEL and every track in between, this  solo, his first solo is by far 150% better, and far beyond more superior  than most &quot;RAP&quot; out here on these streets today, if you don't own  this peice you better run to your nearest retailer RIGHT NOW and pick it  up, cherish it like your first born because you won't find much out here on  this level, That HIGHER LEVEL! By time 1993 rolled around, cats were getting a lot more lyrical in the hip-hop lexicon. It was virtually a game of ""can you top this"" as several well-oiled rhyming machines left mediocre & stagnant rappers in a cloud of dust. KRS-One has always stayed ahead of the trends, and "" Return of the Boom Bap"" is no different. In my opinion, he is arguably rhyming tighter than he ever has before. His content & strong message tracks weave excellently in and out of some of his finest lyricism to date.The production is uniformly excellent, and hits hard with a minimal and spare set of beats, which is 100% boom bap. The legendary Dj Premier, who is also on top of his game, produces most of the tracks here, with KRS-One producing 4 tracks himself. Kid Capri also produces 2 tracks, and Showbiz kills it on another. All in all, these elements add up to an unstoppable force. Every track here is bananas... ""Outta Here"", ""Black Cop"", ""I Can't Wake Up"", ""Sound Of Da Police"", ""Higher Level"", """"P"" Is Still Free""... every tracks bangs with a rugged & raw fury. This is hand down essential KRS-One material. Recognize the master. The sound quality is terrible. The music is so loud that you can barely hear the rapping. If you turn it up it sounds worse! The beats are crazy. Concepts and rhymes are incredible.  These guys should do more albums together.  The title track had me jumping all throughout my 10th grade.  B-boying at its best. Krs's best album by far, its the complete package. not really feeling this one as much as i thought i would considering everyone loves this album.  i think his self titled album has the better couple of premier beats on it then every beat on this album.  overall this one is mediocre for me Albums ranks high in Lyrics, Beats. delivery, and message. Definetky a ckassic album and a must buy for true hip hop lovers. Leave it to KRS-One to teach what hip hop is supposed to sound like. After dropping the Boogie Down Productions name, Kris comes correct on his 1993 album, Return Of The Boom Bap. The production on here is pretty much on point, courtesy of DJ Premier, Kid Capri, Norty Cotto, and Showbiz. All those dope producers, expect that signature east coast sound to represent.A good number of tracks here are excellent. Tracks such as ""Outta Here"", ""Slap Them Up"", and ""Sound Of The Police"" (if you can, get the 12"" that has the B-side ""Hip Hop Vs. Rap"") are easy standout. ""Mad Crew"" is an easy headbanger, along with ""P Is Still Free"". Another favorite of mine is ""Brow Skin Woman"".Kris missteps here on early points on this album like the boring sounding ""Mortal Thought"" and the odd concept of himself being a blunt being passed around to various rappers on ""I Can't Wake Up"". A few others float around, but that doesn't stop that from being a good album. Given that this is one that defiantly needs to be in your music collection, as this one would be in rotation for sometime. Peace.Lyrics: AProduction AGuest Appearances: BMusical Vibes: B+Top 5 Tracks:1. ""P"" Is Still Free2. Brown Skin Woman3. Outta Here4. Mad Crew5. Slap Them UpHonorable Mention:1. Return Of The Boom Bap2. Sound Of Da Police KRS-One's first ""solo"" album is 1993's ""Return of the Boom Bap."" After the original six Boogie Down Productions albums, KRS dropped the BDP moniker and dropped this gem. Kris enlisted the production of legend DJ Premier, who only recently had begun to receive recognition for his musical genius as a member of Gang Starr. The beats, however, while excellent, are quite simple, allowing KRS-One and his awesome character to take center stage. He drops some of the political and social stances of the last two BDP albums,EdutainmentandSex and Violence, in favor of a more entertaining and overall simpler approach. That's not to say that the verses aren't relevant. His classic tales of police brutality, urban injustice, and hip hop loyalty are all here. He just delivers them in a way that puts the music and the performance to the forefront. This is a totally classic album. Every song is totally memorable, because KRS puts such a great performance on every track. Whether he's screaming, singing, or toasting like a dancehall reggae performer, he entertains first and foremost. No track is even average or any worse than the others, this is pretty close to a perfect hip hop album. I couldn't find you any flaws, it's arguably hip hop's greatest MC teamed with arguably hip hop's greatest producer. A must have for the rap fan.The album begins with an awesome intro, ""KRS-One Attacks,"" where Premo laces a totally dope beat and covers it with some old BDP samples, to make a perfect start. ""Outta Here"" uses simple drum-and-bass to allow KRS to address the current state of hip hop, chronicling his life as a rapper and talking about the tendency of rappers to ""fall off."" Perhaps his best known song, ""Black Cop"" follows. Here, he is an entertainer first and an MC second, yelling and screaming, completely going wild on the mic. Anyone who hasn't sang along to the yelps of ""Black coooop...black COP black COP black COP"" shouldn't consider themself a hip hop fan. ""Mortal Thought"" is relevant, with a great chorus. I love the conceptually genius ""I Can't Wake Up,"" where KRS raps from the perspective of a blunt. He namedrops most of the big names of '93 rap, as the MCs pass the blunt from rapper to rapper. Again, he yells and sings a great chorus, this song's another classic. The nice ""Slap Them Up"" precedes the infamous ""Sound of da Police."" The look at police brutalities is simply rap at its finest. My favorite part is where he draws a connection between the similar-sounding words ""overseer"" and ""officer"" in the second verse, as they both oppressed the urban black community. The chorus is just classic, nobody else could ever pull this off like KRS-One. ""Mad Crew"" has a heavily sampled beat, and ""Uh Oh"" uses a human beatbox in favor of a drum machine. ""Brown Skin Woman"" delivers musically and lyrically, and the following title track is just awesome. ""'P' Is Still Free"" is once again classic material, I remember first hearing this song on theMenace II Society: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrackcompilation. The album ends perfectly with ""Stop Frontin'"" and ""Higher Level,"" a provocative challenge to American religion with a heavy horn-laden beat.I feel like this album gets overlooked in comparison to the BDP albums, but I think this is as entertaining and enjoyable as anything KRS-One has ever done. A classic album in every sense of the word, perfect hip hop from the best year for the genre, 1993. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and pick it up. This is probably the best solo album KRS-One has ever put out. Sorry to say there are probably other good ones, but this is the best put together one. The beats, the rhymes, and the material go together very nicely. My favorites are Outta Here, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound of Da Police, Uh Oh, Return of the Boom Bap, and Stop Frontin'. But the other songs are good too. I recommend this to fans of Boogie Down Productions or Hip Hop in general. Boogie Down Productions leader KRS-One's reputation began to slip in the early '90s, as he spent more time educating than performing. He hit back at his critics with the slamming Return of the Boom Bap, his first official solo release. Leaving behind the detailed production of the last BDP album Sex and Violence, Boom Bap returns the MC to the spare, gritty territory of Criminal Minded. KRS-One sounds reinvigorated, as well, spitting out his rhymes with fury and intelligence. Although the record isn't as didatic as Edutainment or Sex and Violence, KRS-One hasn't made his lyrics simplistic, nor has he abandoned his cutting, intelligent social commentary. The combination of hard, basic beats and exciting rhymes makes Rerturn of the Boom Bap a genuine comeback for KRS-One, one of the founding figures of modern hip-hop. Honestly after Scott La Rock died, I always thought BDP was KRS and nothing else.  KRS finally decided it was time to just offically end it and let go of all the people riding his coat-tails.  What a way to go for dolo.  When ""Sound of Da Police"" dropped I knew it was on.At the time a lot of NY underground Hip-Hop was already grimey and had that ""boom bap"" sound, so the LP's title wasn't as revelent as it would be now.  Despite that, KRS and Primo put down some dope beats and rhymes and delivered a classic LP that is used as a formula for many ""true school"" heads. love it, especially because premier (single best producer ever) dominates the credits... interestingly enough my favorite song, slap them up wasn't done by him ... CAN'T WAIT for return of the boom bip, gonna be best album in the past 10 years (i hope, i find myself saying that a lot; then albums like rakim's or cuban linx 2 come out and kill my faith in what's left of hip hop, but this time it's primo and i don't think primo's EVER done anything that's bad) return of the boom bap is a great classic. it's way up there with 93 til infinity by souls of mischief, a future without a past by leaders of the new school, one for all , ed o.g and da bulldogs first album and gang starr step in the arena. it's crafted beats on krs-one album is by the talented dj premier. it's lyrics is so great too. check out sound of the police and mad crew. this is a gifted classic. with it's old school, loud bass original lyrics. definately a must have for any true hip hop head. I was a basshead and this album was played quit a bit in the car, especially the song in the middle of the album with a bass line that goes and goes just loved it.  Also liked the idea of being passed around as a blunt.  Overall, the album has some offbeats, steady beats, and slamming beats. To anyone interested in KRS ones ""Return of the boom bap;"" take a minute to check this review cuz I've got something to say to ya.This album is the real hip hop, staight up.Every track is as good as the last with passionate rhymes and dope beats.I was looking for a great hip hop sound and I've listened to guys like tribe called quest, ol' dirty bastard, Hieroglyphics, Public Enemy, Soul Assassins, you know, true Artists that appreciate the roots of real rap.After picking up this album it was like coming upon a diamond in the rough. This is one of KRS ones eariest album. I rescently found out it was discontinued, which is a shame, they really need to get it back on the shelf because people are missing out.Now, I'm not gonna go on a tangent about how each song is great, cuz theres no point, once you listen to these beats you'll know exactly where I'm comin' from.In short, it's dope, without a doubt. Return of the Boom Bap""Return of the boom-bap means just that, it means return of the real hard beats and real rap.""  Released in the fall of 1993, KRS-One's first official solo album is arguably his best. In the early 90's, a new generation of west coast-based MCs became the superstars of rap; while in the east, acts like Naughty by Nature and Das EFX were stealing the thunder of their 1980's predecessors.  Produced largely by Gang Starr's DJ Premier, Return of the Boom Bap rejuvenates standard-bearer KRS-One's stance as the Teacher of Rap while giving him a more competitive stoop to stand on.The LP's first single, ""Outta Here"" warns currently hot rappers that their material trappings may not last: ""Credit cards and bank account? Outta here; no doubt, BDP is old-school but we ain't goin' out..""  On the surreal ""I Can't Wake Up"", KRS sees himself turned into a cigar, while humorously name-checking various early 90's rap stars.  ""The P is Still Free"" updates a song from Criminal Minded about the lost souls of crack addiction.  The Kid Capri-produced ""Brown Skin Woman"" critiques the sexism in rap, and the LP's biggest hit, ""Sound of Da Police"" (produced by Showbiz) highlights the dangers of police brutality in a post-Rodney King landscape:  ""The overseer had the right to get ill; and if you fought back the overseer had the right to kill; the officer has the right to arrest; and if you fight back they put a hole in your chest..""The most blazing track would have to be the album's closer, ""Higher Level"": with a blistering funk sample from the Blacula soundtrack, KRS rants and raves about politics & religion in the glorious fashion that only he can:  ""I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm crying broke; I like to ask these politicians, `would Jesus vote?'""At the time of its release, the album (and most others) was overshadowed by Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle.  In comparison, Doggystyle may have slicker production values, but Boom Bap's jazz-based rhythm tracks seem less dated, and with far less gangster excess.  This deserves the deluxe re-release treatment, with any bonus material available. I LOVE OLD SCHOOL HIP HOP KRS ONE IS ONE THE GREAT TEACHER OF HIP HOP. BECAUSE HIS CD GIVES YOU INFORMATION THAT IS THE TRUTH. overall, this is a pretty good album with a few outstanding cuts. ""Outta Here"", ""I Can't Wake Up"", and ""Mortal Thought"" are all fairly entertaining tracks that showcase KRS-One's gifted delivery and his creative flow. but the production of this record sounds dated and alot of the songs toward the end of the record are forgettable. i prefer the hardcore leanings of his BDP days rather than these semi-concious psuedo-ragga party jams. but KRS's voice is still a treat to listen to and this record is probably better than almost any other hip hop album put out in 1993. KRS-1's best release after the BDP LP's. His subject matter is truly remarkable. His visuals hypnotize you and take you to where the story is at the moment. Extremely DOPE around the board! 10 stars!!! This was one of the first Hiphop albums I ever purchased and I still listen to it today I think that krs's style was best suited to Primos production. Once he lost Primo (with the exception of a few albums) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly. krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack MCs that deserved it. This was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his BDP days as well as few musical/lyrical tricks up his sleeve This album along with any other BDP release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into Hiphop this was the era that I belive Hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now I wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper. Loving the album and cannot beat the convenience of mp3 download.  Would have rated higher if bitrate was a bit higher.  I know I'm overkill when backing up my CDs but since space is so cheap, I default to the highest possible bitrate.  The mp3s sound great, even on my entertainment system so it's not the biggest issue in the world.  I'm definitely watching purchases more closely though as I have noticed some downloads were not even as high a bitrate as what I had from years ago. as one of the innovators of real hip-hop KRS has never let up on his lyrics, style or performance, he's  at 100% all the time, on this album he's at 110%! his firt solo effort away from BDP is incredible. don't try  to compare this album with the efforts that followed, as good as they are,  this his best so effort to date God damn, I haven't heard an album with so much effort and time put into it. Other classics were dropped before and after this but this is just a timeless classic, I can't stress just how much this album reigns SUPREMACY. KRS-One dropped 2 hot albums with BDP (Criminal Minded and By Any Means Necessary) which were just off the hook but this is different. His voice has matured a lot more than what it was in his earlier days and his lyrics are thoughtful and excellent. Check out Sound Of Da Police to experiment his might and talent. F*ck tha Police by N.W.A. is by far the best diss song towards the police but this follows it right behind it. I really like his 'Overseer/Officer' rhyme and the way he raps in his Jamaican way as he did back in Criminal Minded. Other cuts enjoyed include Outta Here, where he talks about his life in the game, I Can't Wake Up, a pleasant track produced by Premier, Uh Oh, using beatboxing as his instruments, Brown Skinned Woman, where he puts it down for the black/brown nation and ""P"" is Still Free, a song dedicated to the girls.I like KRS-One for several reason but the strongest being that he's one of the few rappers to understand REAL HIP-HOP. Take a look at the title, Return of the Boom Bap. It means just that: it's the return of REAL RAP. He's kept it true since '87 and still he's doing it. This is probably the best '93 rap album, waay better than Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle. It's definately one of my favorite top 50 rap albums of all time. Check this out, coz KRS-One is out to ATTACK!Best moments= Outta Here, I Can't Wake Up, Sound of Da Police and Brown Skinned Woman Once again, Krs-One brings it to you straight no chaser...with help from DJ Premier and others you can't go wrong with this one.my fave tracks:1)Outta Here2)Sound Of Tha Police4) Higher Level..i LOVE the lyrics.if you're a early 90's hip-hop fan or just starting your collection,i recommend this one. Seriously hardcore rappin here...! Kris is back in bussiness with this gem of an album. By far the best album of the 90's, the combination of phat beats and clever rappin makes this album a pleasure to listen to! If i could i'd give this album 10 out 5 / Return Of The Boom Bap is a must get for all the rap fans out there!! What else can be said about this album that hasn't been said already?  This is basically a collaboration between two legends of the genre (KRS One and DJ Premier) while both were at the top of their games.  It gets no better than that.  Period.  I feel kind of special because this is the kind of stuff I was growing up on.  I think it was 9th or 10th grade for me when this came out and I ran out and got this after hearing ""Outta Here"" for the first time.  ""Sound Of The Police"", ""Outta Here"", ""Return Of The Boom Bap, ""Mortal Thought"", ""Black Cop"", ""Brown Skin Woman"", ""Uh Oh"", ""Higher Level""....I mean, the list of classics on this disc goes on and on.  The sound can best be described as bass heavy boom bap (hence the title of the album).  Kinda makes me miss the early/mid 90's sound...  *sigh*As far as flaws, I can only think of one...""I Can't Wake Up.""  That song was a bit of a misstep.  Otherwise, the rest is straight fire.  Anyone giving this less than 4 stars doesn't know what a timeless piece this album truly is.Return Of The Boom Bap is classic.  Point blank.  Period.  If you haven't heard this album yet, then quit cheating yourself and check it out.  It may have come out in '93, but it sounds just as fresh 13 years later.  I highly recommend making this one a collection piece.Standout Tracks: 'P' Is Still Free, Slap Them Up, Black Cop, Mad Crew, Outta Here, Brown Skin Woman, Sound Of The Police, Stop Frontin', Mortal Thought, Uh Oh, Higher Level (My Favorite), and Return Of The Boom Bap CLASSIC.LYRICS ---------- 10/10PRODUCTION COURTESY OF D.J PREMIER --------- 10/10THEME --------- 10/10ALBUM COVER --------- 10/10CONCEPT --------- 10/10GUEST APPEARANCE --------- NONESTAND OUT TRACKS -------- OUTTA HEREOVERALL ----------- EXCELLENTO.KAKA GOD'S GIFT TO DA UNDERGROUND. Awesome, hard hitting, lyrical, I love the album. Must have for a good hip hop collection of music. Good stuff. I have been a krs-one fan for a LONG time, and would have to say this is his best album.  Sound Of Da Police is completely off the hook, the lyrics are some of the best you'll come across.  Krs is one of the greatest rappers ever, and this album is a timeless underground classic.  This is REAL hip-hop, dont support what we hear on the radio these days, its all crap, listen to legends like krs-one and rakim.  Other good tracks are KRS-One Attacks and Return Of Da Boombap.Beats - 10/10Lyrics - 10/10Production - 10/10Originality - 10/10Final Note - 5 Mic Classic, one that all true rap/hip-hop fans have.  Classic album, one of the best of our time. ...And neither will I.  KRS & Primo?  Maybe if we got prime-era Michael Jackson to team up with the Neptunes, we might get something that approaches this in terms of hot.  I've owned this album for a few years and I just recently re-discovered the last track ""Higher Level"" (I'd always stopped on ""Outta Here"" and ""Sound of the Police"").  Fresh for 2004, you suckers.  ""Mortal Thought"" is a sure-fire battle track.  Maybe cut it up with Spinbad's ""Rap Vs. Hip Hop"" (Drop it in right after KRS drops the opening line from ""Outta Here"".  Just a thought...).  One day, when we're blessed with an acapella version of ""Boom Bap"", someone will do ""Outta Here"" over Xzibit's ""Los Angeles Times"" beat.  But I digress -- the gist here is this gets five stars just for existing, plus it's good. The first official solo release from Boogie Down Production's leader KRS-One (Kris Parker) is far from the legendary status of Criminal Minded or By All Means Necessary, but KRS-One sounds reinvigorated, rejuvenated, as well, spitting out his rhymes with fury, ferocity, and intelligence. In the early-'90s KRS-One's reputation began to slip, as he spent more time ""educating"" and ""enlightening,"" oppose to doing what he does best, spitting rhymes. Return of the Boom Bap slaps the critics directly in the face, crushing any thoughts, rumors, or signs of KRS-One's image beginning to slip. Deserting the style and production from the last B.D.P. album Sex and Violence, Boom Bap returns KRS-One to the tough, hardy territory of Criminal Minded. The most INCREDIBLE album of 1993.  FAR superior to Snoop Doggy Dogg's  debut album, which overshadowed this, plus seemingly everything else at the  time.  Do yourself a favor and PICK THIS UP!  DJ Premier and Kid Capri's  production skills are not to be fronted on!Most blazing track:  Higher  Level-  With a blistering sample from the BLACULA soundtrack (?), Kris  rants and raves in the glorious fashion that only he can.Other  outstanding cuts:  KRS-One Attacks, Outta Here, Sound of Da Police, P is  Still Free.This is the first official SOLO album from KRS-ONE of Boogie  Down Productions.  Check out all his other albums, including the latest, I  GOT NEXT... I first heard of Kris on the track 'Hush' (from tony hawks III) and immediately bought this album. It's a good album but I don't think it's worth the 'best album of the 90's' label some reviewers have given it. Classic Tracks on the album are 'KRS-One Attacks' (if only it was longer), 'Outta Here', 'Mortal Thought (Amazing first verse) and I really like 'Brown Skinned Woman'. This is good stuff, but I think he can do better. This Albums made me wanna get a more recent one, to see if he really IS as good as everyone says he is!Anyway, the best album of the 90's is 'It takes a nation of millions to hold us back' Public Enemy forever! This album is hard as hell. Just beats and rhymes, it's a distilled version of east coast hip-hop from the early 90's. KRS takes nearly everyone in America to task and runs through politics, hate crimes, to plain old beating down wack mc's. KRS gets some of the best producers of the time on his side, including DJ Premier - who continued his amazing streak of fat beats through the rest of the 90's. 'Outta here' is an absolute classic, and 'KRS One Attacks', 'Black Cop', I Can't Wake Up (I love it when he hollers that ""I'm dreamin - about being a blunt...""), Slap Them Up, 'Sound of da Police', '""P"" Is Still Free' are personal favourites as well. This is one for your mind and to toughen up your hiphop collection. The first album from KRS-One{Knowledge Rein Supreme...} that i loved on the first listen.KRS One Attacks,Blacc cop,Sound of da police, Mad Crew,""P' Is Still Free,Stop Frontin'!!! is insane,Higher Level!!!{Not for the dumb,deaf,& blind}, & Outta Here. Criminal minded, by any means, return of the boom bap, krs one (self titled) are the best albums he ever did and made him the legend he is. On this particular album he displays his true lyricism such as metaphors,battle rap etc. This is definately far entertaining then previous releases such as sex and violence, edutainment, and ghetto music, those albums came off to preachy in my opinion and don't standout amongst his better efforts as I mentioned before. You can play the whole thing through, although in my opinion the only track I would skip is ""uh oh"" because it's a beatbox beat which get's annoying after awhile other then that this is a classic album in hip hop and a landmark in it's history. People dump on Kris ever since his transformation into epicene pop sensation Michael Jackson, but you gotta give him props for being versatile. The vagaries of the market and the stress of spaning widely divergent genres have forced him/her into some very awkward positions, to say the least. First, he/she is derided as a sell-out after the runaway worldwide success of her Thriller album two decades ago. Then, to restore his street cred, he resumes the bad@ss macho posturing to give a shout out to his homeboy Osama, thus giving a delicious frisson of aging enfant terrible to his already schizophrenic image. But all those years of groping little boys and slicing up his face to look like Diana Ross have rendered the carefully crafted image permanently bogus. Castrati can never become gangstas again, no matter how many hormone injections they take at Swedish transgender clinics. Miss Swish should have stayed in her closet and faded into well-deserved obscurity. Peace. True hip hop at its purest form was being born wit krs's return of the boom rap... Diz should already be in true heads collection no weak joints. A classic from a genious. Best tracks ? "" mad crew"" , ""sound of the police"" , and , ""stop frontin"" a true classic. The album adresses issues that are real, just brushed under the carpet by many people. to the guy ADL123 who calls him a terrorist, thats a very republican(stupid) thing to say. Its a shame when people die, but you know what, now we just have a slightest taste of what its like for most other countries. To call this guy a terrorist and tell people to not buy his album because of his freedom of speech is stupid. And you are obiously one of those people who live in your own fantasy land while chanting 4 more years...4 more years...well you got your 4 more years, enjoy them while millions suffer. Some people seem to think that &quot;I Got Next&quot; is KRS' best album, but to my ears it pretty damn overrated. This album demonstrates KRS as the great, clever lyricist he is, and he is accompanied by nice production from  one of hip-hop's finest, DJ Premier. He truly is the greatest emcee ever to  touch a microphone. He is the only emcee who's as great today as he was ten  years back. Krs-One returned with a vengeance in 93, and dropped a CLASSIC in the form of Return Of The Boom Bap. This album, like every other Krs-One album, represents him in his truest form, always talking about something positive, claiming to be &quot;the teacher&quot; of hip hop, and saying things to leave you thinking. Here's the review:Album Highlights: Krs-One Attacks, Outta Here, Black Cop, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound Of Da Police, Mad Crew, and Return Of The Boom Bap.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: While NOT as strong as Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary, this is still Krs at his best. Today, he still remains one of the most influential MCs out there keeping his legacy alive. Overall, I recommend you pick up this album. Sh**!!! This album is off the hook! ""Outta Here"" has one of the best beats ive ever heard!! Thats on a real HIPHOP tip right there! KRS-One's voice is better than ever and his lyrics are ON POINT EVERY TRACK! KRS-One has kept it real out of most emcees out of all these years. You got to give him his repsect. This guy is a TRUE emcee and if you dont like him, then go listen to your wack azz 50 Cent album. The production on this album is pretty much what gives it its name. Grimey old school soundin hiphop beats. If you want TRUE hiphop, better get this now! Real stuff.

205,420,B00000051C,"Please understand that the meagerly two stars does not reflect the quality of the music itself. The songs are good--the material on this album ranks among Trout's finest, I think--but the sound quality is TERRIBLE!!!I was in disbelief when I looked on the credits and saw that three or four people were actually involved in the production and engineering of this album. I literally thought at first that Trout and his band had recorded this themselves home-made. It makes my stereo sound like a transistor radio--some songs don't even sound like they were recorded in stereo! No bass--and too much blasted high end! (his guitar tone has too much of that tinny high end on some of his other albums, too.) Given that this album was recorded only about ten years ago, it's inexcusable to release a CD of this quality, sound-wise.I'm glad Walter came back with more releases later that apparently utilized technology invented in the last forty years! If Walter Trout Band is Tellin' Stories, it must be stories that have already been told a thousand times before.There is nothing new, nothing  smashing about this album. Every single song is one big clich&eacute;. It's decent  blues, all right, but it's not worth listening to on your stereo. Go to a  concert instead.The exception is the rock'n'roll track Tremble which  has something. But even on this one, Walter Trout Band is mainly a band of  workmanship, not a band of creativity! Excellent blues-rock but the European mix is hideous. This is the overall best effort from Walter Trout. The material hold a higher standard than other albums which are featuring mostly non-exciting but very traditional blues numbers. The material on ""Telling stories"" includes some songs that aren't the typical blue print blues, and that brings a feeling of variation. The best tracks are: ""Tremble"", ""Wanna see the morning"", and ""Somebody's crying"". Walter Trout has been a fixture on the electric-blues scene for years, but many of his later albums are inconsistent.  The playing is always vintage Trout, but on virtually everything in the last decade there are peaks and valleys.  If you never heard the original Walter Trout Band lineup on ""Telin' Stories"", you have missed the genesis of the artist. It's the cradle of his rock, and this CD kicks from beginning to end.  Each song is completely different from the next, and there's no gristle in this meat.  Solid blues with power and believability, opening to closing.  HIGHLY recommended.  I'd actually rate this 4 1/2 stars but haven't figured out how to do that! I have read reviews in which Walter Trout has received some criticism for his lack of originality, his technical ability in guitar playing being not as good as some others, his limited vocal ability, playing too many notes on the guitar, being to repetetive, songs too long etc.Well everyone is entitled to their opinion but I reckon that's all a load of horse sh#t.Just put any Walter Trout album on, THEY ARE ALL VERY, VERY GOOD!I like the guy's voice, which I think is better than a lot of the other great blues players, but his guitar playing is what captures me every time.  No wonder he was voted one of the greatest guitar players ever, he is amazing.  I am a great fan of blues rock and Walter Trout is the master of that style of music.This album is an onslaught of blues rock, with an occasional slower paced number here and there.  My favorite tracks are &quot;tremble&quot;, &quot;head hung down&quot;, &quot;tellin' stories&quot;, but I think the best track is &quot;wanna see the morning&quot;.The only reason I don't give this album 5 stars is because of the production.  To me it just seems to lack a bit of punch  overall, that oomph behind it, as the bass needs to be turned right up when you play it.  Maybe digitally remastering would solve this problem, but don't let this stop you from getting this CD because dispite the production the 12 tracks are scorchers and I thuroughly recommend it.","Electric Blues,Blues,Vocal Pop,Modern Blues,Pop",please understand meagerly two stars reflect quality good material ranks among trouts finest think sound quality terrible disbelief looked credits saw three four people actually involved production engineering literally thought first trout band recorded home made makes stereo sound like transistor radio dont even sound like recorded stereo bass much blasted high end guitar tone much tinny high end given recorded ten years ago inexcusable release cd quality sound wise im glad walter came back releases later apparently utilized technology invented last forty years walter trout band tellin stories must stories already understand meagerly stars reflect quality good material ranks trouts think sound sound quality quality terrible disbelief looked credits saw people actually involved production production engineering engineering literally thought trout band recorded home stereo stereo sound sound transistor transistor radio radio sound recorded stereo bass blasted high high end end guitar guitar tone tone tinny high high end end recorded years years ago inexcusable release cd cd quality quality sound wise im glad glad walter came came back releases later apparently utilized technology invented years walter trout trout band tellin stories stories

207,426,B000000528,"Definitely collect any & everything Short has something to do with. .....even albums he guest appearance on I rate this C.D five because if it's not the clear lyric's it's the funk deep bass, that make you listen to the whole C.D . There is no doubt that Too Short is the AC/DC of rap. His songs are instantly identifiable. Some may say that all of Too Short song sound the same, yet the truth is that Too Short lays down a blueprint that every rapper worth their salt studys. Cocktails takes a big jump from the basic old school beats of earlier Too Short albums. (Life is..., Born To Mack, Shorty the Pimp.)This time around it is clear that short has learned to craft a song by using live instrmentation and lyrics that are clever and serious at the same time. This is the album that relly shows that Too SHort will always come up with another rap. I reccomend this for any rap fan or aspiring MC. For years I ignored this cd, primarily due to ignorance.  There are a handful of really great songs on here, so I highly suggest picking it up.  I consider this Too Short's last good cd.  Don't miss out.  Everything after this is unlistable garbage and collaberations with ""young up and coming rappers"".  Cocktails is GOOD. This line came from the song &quot;I'm a playa&quot;, and it holds true.  I mean the guy uses the same few rhymes over and over again, but gosh darn it, he holds down as one of the tighest rappers ever.  This was one of the  few rap CDs that I could push play and let it go.  With guest appearences  by 2Pac, MC Breed, Freddy B, and Ant Banks, this album was off the hook.  I  did not think there could be an album to top &quot;Get in Where You Fit  in&quot; but this came mighty close. Comming off the phenomonal and one of my personal favorite albumsGet in Where You Fit In, Short Dog hits us with his ninth album Cocktales in late '94/early '95. Trufully, this album picks up where his previous album left off with funky production and signiture Short Dog & Dangerous Crew rhymes. With the lead single ""Cocktales"", that basically is another remake of his classic song ""Freaky Tales"", and more than likely you know what the subject matter is.Too Short kicks some great rhymes. Like any other album, you'll have enough bad words through out this album. But that is why we love him. A standout song would be ""Giving Up The Funk"" with the Dangerous Crew. ""Comming Up $hort"" he kicks some rhymes over a great beat. A lot of reviewers speak of the song ""Top Down"", because Short flows almost perfectly over an Ant Banks beat. I personally like the final track ""Don't **** For Free"" because the production and the hook to the song.Whenever Short isn't kicking rhymes about pimpin', he kicks something else worth listening to which is also great. I like the second single ""Paystyle"" about how he's comming in the rap game and saying something about the biting rappers. ""Thangs Change"" he rhymes about how much has changed in the urban neighborhoods and how kids grow up too fast. It's good to hear tracks like that from Short Dog and whats on his mind. That track also features Illegal (Jamal and Malik), Baby D, and Temptest. ""Sample The Funk"" has production that reminds me of his previous album as the track itself is so funky and easy listening.Overall, Cocktales is a great album. Too Short hit his lyrical peak with this LP. At the same time, this album doesn't topGet in Where You Fit In, but comes very close. There are no bad tracks on here, and all are worth listening to. It's a shame how far he's fallen nowadays in the rap game. With the music he dropping now makes this album even sound better. But at the end of the day, this is one album I recommend adding to your collection. Peace.Lyrics: A+Production: AGuest Appearances: AMusical Vibes: ATop 5 Tracks:1. Don't **** For Free2. Top Down3.

Thangs Change (featuring Illegal, Baby D, and Tempest)3. Comming Up $hort Too short is one of the most original and best rappers of the genre.His beats are really good and the lyrics are clever unlike many rappers today.I would recommend getting this album to any too short fan.Ive said my peace. Too Short never fails to impress me.  He is the most consistent mc in the game, has near the most albums by a solo artist and has never dropped a garbage album.  Cocktails is no different.  Mackadocious pimp rhymes has made Too Short a living legend.  He is definitely in the top ten best emcees ever and this is one of his better albums.  Cocktails has more updated beats than was on his previous releases.  Are they better?  Yes and No.  The beats have lost that touch of funk ( not as much of it in these songs ) and opts for more bumpable mainstream sound.  It's either good or bad depending on your tastes in beats.  To me they are equally bumpable.  Too Short drops classic lines in songs such as Cocktales, Ain't Nothing But Pimping-a hilarious chorus, Thangs Change-where he drops knowledge on women degrading themselves, premarital sex, and sex on TV and how it is destroying youth, Can I Get A B!tch, Paystyle, etc. etc.  Too Short lets other producers such as Ant Banks and The Dangerous Crew handle the majority of the beats.  Tupac Shakur shows up for a guest appearance on We Do This, one of the best songs on the cd, along with MC Breed, Jamal & Malik from Illegal and Ant Banks.  Overall this is a classic Too $hort album.  Short Dog doesn't disappoint and keeps it real.  I recommend it. If it aint the most funky bass bangin hip hop track around then what is.  Who cares about the raps, when the bass line is this funky nothing else matters.  Quite a good album from start to finish but track 8, funk with a capital bass.  As usual the Ant Banks tracks are the choice cuts obviously starting with Top Down then Can I get a Bitch and Giving Up the funk respectively.  Not as consistantly enriched with funk as hes previous 2 albums overall, its still from start to finish a full on listen making him the funkiest rapper alive.  Top Down cannot be matched in my opinion for funk 2 years since he dropped my favorite of his albums, $hort is back with my 2nd favorite of his 9 albums of his that I own. Packed with some of the best production I ever heard on an album (that Dangerous Crew funk) and some of the best dirtiest song I ever heard on here. Of the 12 songs, 2 are classics, 2 or 3 are almost classic material, 3 are ok, and the rest are good or great songs. Guests are not on all the songs like newer albums, they get down with $hort on 5 songs. Production is just unbelievably funky and out of this world as Dangerous Crew members do 11 of the 12. The Dangerous Crew, the always great Ant Banks and Too $hort each do 3 songs, Shorty B, Spearhead X and Pee Wee each do 1. A must have rap album for fans of real rap and fans of that funky west coast music.#1 - 8.5#2 - 9.5 (great Freaky Tales from $hort -- dirty song w/ great beat)#3 - 9.5 (f/ Ant Banks who also provides a great beat -- another dirtier song)#4 - 8.5 (tight beat -- hook is kind of annoying)#5 - 8.5 (f/ Mr. Malik & Jamal of Illegal, Baby D & Tempest-- nice beat)#6 - 9 (tight beat)#7 - 7.5 (f/ Ant Banks, Goldy, Pee Wee)#8 - 10 (CLASSIC -- UNREAL BEAT from Ant Banks)#9 - 10 (CLASSIC -- f/ 2Pac {R.I.P.}, MC Breed, Father Dom -- great beat)#10 - 7.5 (f/ Old School Freddie B -- tight beat)#11 - 8 (nice beat)#12 - 7.5 (dirty song w/ good beat)Todd Shaw -- b. 4/29/66 -- b. Los Angeles, CA moved to Oakland, CACheck all my reviews BIIIIATCH!!! OK...Get In Where You Fit In was my favorite, I have to say that this is his Best Album. The beats are very good and bump endlessly. His lyrical pimp-hand seems to be at its strongest. I definetly feel that this embodies a good majority of his work. Point being, cop this and play it everytime you're chillin w/your friends or drivin around your city. Peace! Cocktales is one of Shorty's best CD's in my opinion. You can ride the to the whole CD except for Thangs Change. Besides for that one song the CD is great. It also features a song by 2pac and MC breed a good mix of cali. Not too much to say about cocktails except for a good album name for Short and overall a A- CD. My favorite song is coming up short then top down. Obviously i've gotta reccommend almost every short album cause im a fan but this CD is good even if your not a true fan like me. Beeyatch! For every Too Short review check out my other reviews why would i have to do a product review on too $hort. he is a legend, what can i tell you about this album that you as a buyer should not already know? In my opinion its his best album and get in where you fit in, is a close second. This album is a classic, and up there with Too Short's best albums ""Get In Where You Fit In"" and ""Gettin' It"". You get 12 tracks, perfect from beginning to the end.As usual, awesome production by Ant Banks, Shorty B, and the rest of the Dangerous Crew. The bass-lines are deep and bump harder than anything you've ever heard. The keyboard work is amazing too. The album's got that 70's funk feel, and it's very laid back...All the featured atrist make remarkeble appearences - Ant Banks, MC Breed, Pee Wee, Mr. Malik, Goldy, Freddie B and the one ond only 2PAC on a classic  guest appearence. This CD's from 1995 but still sounds great this days. People tend to foget that Too Short is the original mack, a true pimp that's been doing it since about 83!! There's no other rapper, with this consistencey and dopeness. It's like Too Short just never gets old. He never ever changed his style in terms of lyrics, he always kept it real. The man is a living legend, the one who put the Bay Area on the map and one of the West Coast rap pioneers (together with NWA and Ice T). Like Short Dog said it on Spice 1's album ""The Black Bossalini"" - ""Recognize Game when it's in your face!"". This in my opinion is his finest album. An ablum where you don't have to hit the Fast forward button once, every track is worth the playtime. With a smooth blend of bass line beats with tales of pimpin' to compliment that...it can't be beat. 5 stars. I recently purchsed this album after buying all the albums Short recorded before it.  I saw the video for Top Down and thgouht the beat was tight so i coped the album cuz you cant go wrong with Short dogg.  After bumpin Top Down for 20 minutes, I went on to listen to the album.  It is funky, but with a different touch of funk than say Shorty the Pimp or Get In Where You Fit In.  Dont get it twisted, this is definetly some straight Cokeland funk, but you can tell Short is moving away from his old school roots in testing new sounds and beats.  I do have to give credit though to Ant Banks, that fool can never make a bad funk beat.  Him and Short together is like a dynamic duo never heard in the rap game.  Especially in the Bay Area.  Top Down is definetly the thumper of this album.  His raps are on point because you will want to bump these beats all over town.  Too $hort is one of those rappers you just are not ashamed of.  He has street cred, pimpin' game, and has produced some of the funkiest, tightest bass loops around.  Too bad this was the last true funk album before $hort got a lil wanksta on us all. 1994-1995 was an awesome period in hip-hop.  Too Short definitely gets his pim strut on real big here.  Now, I may not be a big fan of pimp/misogyny rap, and Short is huge on this, but I cannot deny it, he is cool; I have 11 of his albums!  He flows easy and simple over the syrupy funk of the beats.  Many complain about Too Short's rhyme schemes, but I do like his flow, and he does rhyme well.  Now, the beats definitely slap with that 90's G-Funk syrupy vibe courtesy of the Dangerous Crew, Shorty B, Pee Wee, Spearhead X, Short himself, and of course, long time cuddy Ant Banks!!  My favorite song here is the Banks and Short collabo, ""Can I Get A B---h.""  The beat is that type you envision ridin' on 3 wheel with triple gold on a famed sunny Cali day!  Banks beat here is one of his best ever.  Banks also heats up the beat with some old school flava on the pimp style rider anthem, ""Top Down.""  2Pac, Father Dom, and Flint Mi.'s great MC Breed trade relentless flows over a bouncy Dangerous Crew beat on ""We Do This.""  ""Thangs Change"" takes a different approach.  Spearhead X and Short Dog create a slow bass heavy G-Funk beat while Short analyzes how screwed up life can be and how values in society have changed over the decades trading spits with Malik, Jamal (from Illegal), and the youngsta from Atlanta Baby D.  ""Paystyle"" is hot with a slick rollin' beat and deep bass and Short gets his hustle on makin that cheddar while buckin' down mark azz MC's. I don't like the simplistic sampling on ""Giving Up The Funk,"" for the sample has been overused and sounds so generic here.  But for the most part, the beats are bangin' with that mid 90's bay area fonk!  Pimp rap was nathan new to Short Dog in 1994/1995, but he always brings that charisma, and why change a winning formula? This is one of my favorites from Too $hort, he never disappoints.Cocktails has nice collabos from the late great 2Pac, MC Breed, Freddy B, and Ant Banks. Too Short , what else can you say? He made music that has an influence on all types of musicians and their styles.","Pop Rap,Pop,Rap & Hip-Hop,Southern Rap,Gangsta & Hardcore,West Coast",definitely collect everything short something even guest appearance rate c five clear lyrics funk deep bass make listen whole c doubt short ac dc rap instantly identifiable may say short sound yet truth short lays blueprint every rapper worth salt studys cocktails takes big jump basic old school beats earlier short life born mack shorty pimp time around clear short learned craft using live instrmentation lyrics clever serious time relly shows short always come another rap reccomend rap fan aspiring mc years ignored cd primarily due ignorance handful really great highly suggest pick definitely collect short guest appearance appearance rate clear lyrics funk deep bass listen doubt short ac ac dc dc rap instantly identifiable say short sound truth short lays blueprint rapper worth salt studys cocktails jump basic old old school school beats earlier short life born mack pimp time clear short learned craft live lyrics clever time shows short come rap rap fan aspiring mc years ignored cd primarily ignorance handful really great highly suggest pick
208,427,B00000052I,"The Vallejo CA sound was started in my memory by The Click. They combine tales of slangin' rock with beats that sound like ""Cutie Pie"" or ""Computer Love"". It is straight West Coast but even Eastern rebels can groove to cuts like Bumble, Hillside, and Its All Bad. This is something different, because 40 has a way with the English language that has never been done before this. Hiphop is lacking innovators and E-40 is the definition of the word, Love him or Hate on him. E-40 was a long-time veteran in the rap game when his seminal album ""In a Major Way"" was released in 1995. It's really the album that got E-40 noticed by a mainstream audience, and pushed Jive to ultimately stuff more money into his forthcoming albums (the next being ""Hall Of Game"" [1996]). This album rides the line between independent and mainstream lines ridiculously well. As far as rapping goes, E-40 is at the very top of his game, boasting his slang-filled flow with a cunning wit, that is arguably in peak form. Most notably, some of the best west coast rappers came to support Forty's untouchable style - 2Pac, Mac Mall & Spice 1 - who all perform flawlessly on the classic posse track ""Dusted 'n' Disgusted"".""Da Bumble"" kicks off the album right after a solid intro. From this point on, we catch a glimpse of what the production will sound like throughout, although minimal, it bangs nicely. The production is mainly kept in-house, and is handled by Mike Mosley, Studio Ton & Funk Daddy among others. There are some stellar tracks here! ""Sideways"" featuring The Click's B-Legit & Mac Shawn is probably my favorite. The beat is tight, and is one of my favorite appearances from B-Legit. ""Spittin'"" is also one of my favorites. The album's front half burns brightly with bangers like these...it almost feels front-loaded with the goods, but truly boasts quality through and through. Then comes perhaps E-40's greatest single - ""Sprinkle Me"". The Click's Suga-T performs immaculately alongside Forty Water. The beat is tight and the lyrics are true to form. Other standouts are the aforementioned ""Dusted 'n' Disgusted"", and the breakthrough single ""1-Luv"". The quality of album tracks in the mix leaves the album free of filler.Consistent quality has always been part of E-40's repertoire. Consistently enjoyable full albums are another thing. ""In a Major Way"" is definitely his most consistent effort to date. Although the beat-makers will prove to hit harder on later albums, there has never been a set of beats/collaborators that E-40 has worked better with. This is one of the albums that defines the Bay Area in the rap world. Hand's down his best album. All of this albums are classics but this is the one. Where do you think Jay-Z and all those other  fools out there learned how to say fo-cheezy and other bay area lingo. Folks in the bay area was talking like that in 1991. E-40's a groundbreaker who deserves a lot more respect than the game has given him. This is off the heezy fo' sheezy.  Some of the tightest beats around and that crazy rapping style that only comes from 40 Fonzarelli.  With the Click in full force along with 2Pac, Spice 1, and the dopest Vallejo  rapper, Mac Mall, this album is straight cavi. Great album from the rydas of the bay, since i am near the bay a lot of my people told me to get this album and i did and i dont regret it one bit, tight songs, dope beats and the good old west coast feeling what else do you need.So get it nowMy Rating - 4.2My Ratings Legend1 Star - The CD is good for doing discs practice and is recyclable too.2 Star - Well atleast the cd can be put up on the rack for one or two song3 Star - Almost there just lacks the quality, keep on trying4 Star - A good album, a must buy and keep in your collection5 Star - Rare Classic Album every song is good and legendry, keep the cd and earn instant respect from peoplePeace Out.. The third solo release, In A Major Way, from the self-proclaimed ""Ambassator of the Bay"" delivers a complete project with mainstream success.  E-40 speaks over ""Intro"" as he gives the ingredients contained in this album that ties with ""Da Bumble"" both produced by Sam Bostic & Mike Mosley with speed variences.  The objective is definately arranged for the trunk as 40 Water flows without any hooks, chorus or breaks, but his original multi-styled flow with charisma and energy as quoted ""...he say / she say / b*tch, that away...""  ""Sideways"" featuring B-Legit & Mac Shon is for the riders hitting the strip or the block as E and B share verses highlighted by the catchy hook.  ""...big timer, timer / 40 water..."" ""Sprinkle Me"" featuring Suga T had all the perfect elements with a memerable hook, perfect delivery and production makes this a highlight with a mainstream feel.  Taking it to the streets with all star support from 2Pac, Mac Mall & Spice 1 on ""Dusted 'N' Disgusted"" as each shined with their signature flow.  Performed as a letter to a friend in jail ""1-Luv"" featuring Leviti poses the reality of simply living and E-40 did not miss a beat.  Relating to getting high and getting drunk for serious smokers and drinkers, ""Smoke 'N' Drank"", was written with just that in mind.  ""Dey Ain't No"" is dark with an incessant deep bass enriched by a piano silhouette to give this LP a more street feel.  Speaking about the street games, E-40 spits on how to invest into businesses for a legal hustle on ""Fed"" featuring Suga T.  Sharing verses with B-Legit & Celly Cel representing the ""H.I. Double L."" side of Vallejo, California on how they live.  ""It's All Bad"" is about life in the ghetto and changing times comparing it to excerpts found in the Bible.  This song was enlighened at the conclusion with a surprise guest by E-40's son with a solid performance.  The ""Outro"" only left the listener craving another dosage of this sixteen track album. 1995 was The Bay Area's biggest year. Artists such as The Luniz, Mac Mall, and the Hieroglyphics were having big hits that year. Too Short just dropped a near classic album. And The Click was on point, reppin' northern Cali area. 40 Water comes out with his third solo album In A Major Way back in'95. The album has that northern west coast vibe that is guaranteed to get listeners moving. A few standouts include ""Ridin' Sidewayz"" with B-Legit, and Mac Shon. ""Spittin'"" has a dope bass line too that will hype you up. ""Sprinkle Me"" is the album's first single that features 40's younger sister Suga-T (she also sings the hook for ""Fed""). Bay Area artists Spice 1, Mac Mall, and Tupac drop in for the dope ""Dusted 'N' Disgusted"". ""Smoke 'N' Drank"" is my favorite from the album that will keep you bouncing (that pre-hyphy style song). 40's younger son comes in and drops a few bars on ""All Bad"" to help close out the album.E-40 dropped an excellent album for '95. In A Major Way is mostly consistent all though out, as it helped represented the west coast. This album vibes like most albums out there and it is highly recommended if you're a fan of their music. 4 stars- Highly recommended. Peace.Lyrics: B+Production: A-Guest Appearances: B+Musical Vibes: A-Top 5 Tracks:1. Smoke 'N' Drank2. Spittin'3. Ridin' Sidewayz (featuring B-Legit and Mac Shon)4. Sprinkle Me (featuring Suga-T)5. Dusted 'N' Disgusted (featuring Spice 1, Mac Mall, and Tupac) E-40's First Major Hit Album was ironically named &quot;In A Major Way&quot; which described how he was moving into the rap game at the time in the mid-nineties. With guest appearances by 2Pac,Spice 1 &amp; Mac Mall, as well as labelmates B-Legit, Suga T, and a young Celly Cel. This album produced many bangin' Bay Area Street Anthems that still bump today just as well as they did back in the summer of '95. I HATE E-40,BUT THE TRACK WITH 2 PAC IS GOOD.THE 2 STARS ARE ONLY FOR THAT SONG.DON'T BUY THIS JUNK TRUST ME. I gave this 5 stars cause this was the hiphop I listen to in high school and I recommend it to everybody who really like the early 90&#34;s rap music....Thanks Amazon It's an album, what else is there to say?text here. more text more text more text more text more text more text more text more text more text more text more text more text more text more text more text more text words one two three four five six THIS ALBUM IZ DOPE,DOPE,DOPE FROM START 2 FINISH NO DOUBT-FIERCE FLOWZ & CLEAN A$$ BEATZ THAT STOMP HELLA HARD-STANDOUT TRACKS R ""SIDEWAYZ"" FEAT.B-LEGIT & ""DUSTED & DISGUSTED"" FEAT.MAC MALL,SPICE-1 & 2PAC(R.I.P.) BUT THS ALBUM IS SIC TA BUMP ALL THA WAY THRU-ALSO PEEP ALL OF E-40,B-LEGIT & THE CLICK'S ALBUMS CUZ THEY ALL SIC WID IT Classic album, this album is what put 40 on the map.One of the best east coast albums in the 90's era!! This is one of the best albums evermade regardless of region.  The source misspoke and caused a major injustice when this album was only given 3.5 mics upon its release.  In a Major Way is the rarified classic where you literally dont have to skip a single track.  It has 12 songs and every single one exemplifies pure fire.  The best tracks, if you want to single out any are The Bumble, Sideways, Sprinkle Me, Dusted n Disgusted(featuring 2pac at his finest), Fed, H-I-Double L Side, 1 Luv, and Bootsie.  If you dont own this, get it now, you've been sleeping on a west coast classic for all to enjoy. On my opinion, this is his best album, it's just damn good!! His unique style mixed with the funky and fat westcoast beats make this album a CLASSIC. It's not right that he didn't sell the units he deserved to. It's not right, that for example Ja Rule or Nelly, who don't have no talent or aren't real make the money, that doesn't belong to them. Maybe E's flow is just too fast for the big audience. It started with The Click and has know come full circle, but along the way there was albums like this that made 40 water the Ballatician he is today. You aint a true Yay Area native if you dont know bout E-40, this album, in my book is THE 1! You got the ultimate song to mob to, &quot;Sideways&quot; on it. If you aint knowin bout this, your player pass should be revoked. Cuts like &quot;Dusted and Disgusted&quot; and &quot;One Love&quot; give you that Bay flavor with rappers like Mac-Mall, and 2Pac, and Spice 1, you cant go wrong with. Im from the Bay, and if you aint got no game go out an pick up this album; listen to it, enjoy it, take it in, and it might help you squares out a little. Give respect where respect is due, and its due, in &quot;A Major Way&quot;. One Love, Peace! I had to write this. I am a huge e-40 fan since 1993. After listening to all his cds. This is the best. Its his best beats and most creavtive lyrics and styles on this cd. I love the songs sprinkle me,dusted and Disgusted with 2pac, and one love. He made videos for all of those. This came out in 96 and he was just starting to make a national name for himself. He never matched this masterpeice.He still never really gets airplay he deserves. But get this cd. E-40 is a true genius. This album hit all the right spots in the &quot;hood&quot;.I can't honestley say this is his best album bto me All his albums was Good but this is the one. Classic! I just had to add this to my collection again. If you missed this back in the 90s don't sleep on it again.  Good stuff! i had this cd back in the days and it broke got me a new one brings back memories. lovely cd. After dropping two underground albums, E-40 came out with In A Major Way, which is an instant classic.  E-40 is from Vallejo, and after dropping this album he proved he had everything it took to be the next West Coast rap star.  His crazy, comical, hip style is a pleasure to listen to.  Also, the beats on this album are some of the best I've heard in a while.  They have a richness to them, which is real good.  Production comes from very accomplished producers like Sam Bostic and Mike Mosely, Studio Tone (who produced some tracks for Kurupt), Funk Daddy, and a few others.  Also, E-40 raps extremely fast on some tracks, and it took me a couple listens to get it when I first started listening to him a long time ago.  However, after a listen, everything sounds clear as a bell!  He's also got an amazing guest list: Tupac, Suga T, Mac Mall, Spice 1, B-Legit, Mac-Shawn, and Celly Cel to name a few.  But most of the tracks have E-40 going solo, which is good too, because it's good to see he's not just relying on others to guest on his album.  Overall the tracks sound &quot;Hipper than a hippopotamous&quot;.The album starts off with this introduction over a slower beat, but then moves into the crazy funked out &quot;The Bumble&quot;.  E-40 rips this track to shreds, and the beat is bananas!  Definitely one of the most original beats I've heard in a while.  &quot;Sideways&quot; also has a tight bouncy beat, and E-40 and B-Legit trade lines on it with class.  Mac-Shawn does the chorus, clever lyricism on here too.  &quot;Spittin'&quot; has a heavy, sunny funk beat.  E-40 comes with a real nice intro at the beginning, but sounds nice throughout.  &quot;Sprinkle Me&quot; is a classic single, with a fun, sunny beat and Suga T (E-40's sister) guests on it.  They make a nice sibling team.  Sprinkle me mayne!  &quot;Dusted And Disgusted&quot; like everyone else says, is a CLASSIC posse cut.  It features Tupac, Spice 1 and Mac Mall.  The way the beat changes is so dope.  E-40 holds his own against three other great emcees.  Part of the beat is a nice, laid-back one, and the other is a rough gangsta beat.  &quot;One Love&quot; is a nice light-hearted track where 40 gets personal.  Great line: &quot;This ain't no happy Shirley Temple talleistic crap/This here is serious, more realistic than radio-shack&quot;.  Actually sounds like it could've been a huge hit even today.  &quot;Smoke And Drink&quot; has more of a Zapp sound to it.  E-40 raps really fast on it, but nicely, and the beat has this cool groove to it, and I love the refrain!  &quot;They Ain't Know&quot; is a slower song about street life and gettin' money.  The lyrics are worth listening to.  &quot;Fed&quot; has a GREAT bouncing bass beat, and E-40 rips it, the tune sounds kind of familiar from something else, it's catchy.  &quot;H-i-Double-L&quot; is a classic ode to Vallejo featuring B-Legit and Celly Cel who both tear it up along with 40.  The beat is nice and sounds like the kind of thing for the car.  &quot;Bootsee&quot; is a tight funky track about a busta named &quot;Bootsee&quot;.  I'm sure you're familiar with someone in real life who fakes and claims to be tough when they're really just fakin' it.  &quot;It's All Bad&quot; is a darker track where 40 speaks on various subjects in life.  He knows the game well.Overall if you like Bay Area rap, you probably have this, but if you don't try it.  E-40 tears it up everytime he's on the mic on this record, and the beats are amazing. This is easily E-40's best work. &quot;In a Major Way&quot; is top-notch material from beginning to end. The beats provide classic West Coast g-funk, while 40's flows and linguistics are solid as usual.Nearly every track is equal in calibur, but the 3 stand-outs would probably be the classic &quot;Dusted &amp; Disgusted,&quot; &quot;1-Luv,&quot; and &quot;Spittin.&quot;There's not one weak track on here. If you're into the West Coast sound, and even if you're not, this is an album you should definitely have in your collection.The West could use another album of this calibur these days. In a Major way is E-40's best album, a Bay Area classic. The Vallejo Boss Playa just blew up on this amazing album. Features the unmatchable beats by Mike Mosley &amp; Sam Bostic, Funk Daddy and Studio Ton. The album is  perfect from start to end and it's got the two classic cuts : Sprinkle Me  (feat. Suga T) and the one and only Dusted 'n' Disgusted, which has one of  the TIGHTEST beats I've ever heard, combined with BREATHTAKING verses by  the greatest rappers - SPICE 1, 2PAC, MAC MALL AND 40 WATER! The album also  features 40's long time partner B-Legit and also Mac Shawn, Levitti and  Celly Cel. This album takes the Sick Wid It Mob sound to a whole new level  and E-40 continues to develop his own unique style, inventing new slang and  always comming with fresh delivery. Umm... What shall I say 'bout this one? It's pretty easy, if you like westcoast rap you gon' love this one! E-40's best all around and probarly one of Bay Area's finest, up there together with Mac Mall's Illegal Business?.E-40 never dissapoints me and after dropping so many albums, he still hasn't got the props he deserves.The whole Bay Area is painfully underated.Mac Mall, Spice 1, E-40 and his Sick-Wid-It records click and Ray Luv, these are my favorites outta Bay Area.Buy anything by them and show love, 'cause it basically don't get pretty much better than this type of Westcoast rap.One word for this record : Classic.I don't even have to mention highlights 'cause they're all great, but my favorite probarly is Dusten 'N' Disgusted featuring 2Pac, Spice 1 and Mac Mall.Get this one, it will make you money worth, no doubt. Man forget any of his new stuff, this is and always will be his best  album.  Really nothing else to say then buy it, if you don't have it. man, this is cd is FIRE, man fo reel. this is his best work in my opinion. u can pop this in and play it thru, E-Fo Day drops heat on this one. id give it 10 stars if i could. go buy this NOW, goddammit. the best songs are: ALL OF 'EM E-40 is at his best on this album.  He may rap about hustlin, sex, and violence like many of his peers, but the way he does it is inventive.  He created much of the slang we use today.  This album is laced with hard mobb beats (""Dusted and Disgusted""), melodic G-Funk laden with whiny keyboard riffs(""Drank and Smoke""), and even a track with a beat hinting of what we call today ""crunk"" (1 Luv).  He paired these neat beats with with his tongue twisting flow.  Most of the songs on the album are classics; the ones that aren't are still tight.  Bump this funky materpiece from the yay while sittin' sideways in a lac! This is 40 Waters second best{just behind element of...}.Intro{that's one of the best intro's i ever heard},Spittin',Sprinkle Me{I can't celieve vibe did not add this classic tracc on there 50 greatest duets of all time}{smh},Dusted 'n' Disgusted,1Luv is crazy,Bootsee,H.I. Double L,Dey Ain't No,Smoke & Drank,Sideways,The Bumble, & It's All Bad ft his lil son. E-40, Forty Water, whatever you want to call him is a bit of an aquired taste, even though I heard his music years ago, it took me until this year to finally check out 1 of his albums.  I first heard him on Aint Hard To Find off 2Pac's All Eyez On Me, and I was thinking who the f*ck is this guy?  His goofy voice and rapid fire flow took me quite a while to get used to, but after bumping Dusted & Disgusted for a long time I decided to pick up In A Major Way.I had to order this from Amazon as there are literally no copies of this album in England, you just can't get hold of stuff like this, and I was surprised by how great it was.  E-40 has long been known as an innovator (something hiphop is sorely lacking), both in terms of his unique flow, and his vast slang vocabulary which so many others have bitten over the years.  This album according to most people is when he was at his peak in both, though I can't comment as this is the only album of his I own (I do intend to buy more though).  My favourite track is still Dusted & Disgusted ft Spice 1, 2Pac & Mac Mall, which is a westcoast classic, but other classics include 1 Luv and the amazing Smoke N Drank.  Pretty much every other track is tight, the only reason i don't quite give it 5 stars is because of a couple of filler tracks (Dey Aint No & Bootsee, which is terrible).  Production is top notch throughout, some classic westcoast beats that really bump.Recommended to any hiphop fans, especially westcoast, if you can get past his wierd voice & flow you will see that some of his lyrics are actually pretty clever.  He raps about the same things most westcoast rappers do, but he does it creatively, if you can't follow him just get a lyrics sheet and listen up, very good album 4.5 stars, another case for half stars at Amazon. Yo, im not from the bay area, but i grew up hearing bout e-40 all the time. ANd i have to say that in a major way is by far the tightest record he has ever dropped. If u have never heard of 40 watta then u know now. GO buy this cd and you will soon find out what you have been missing. This album is a classic, outstanding, the production is A+++lyrics and flow of E-40 is tiggidy tight, what else can i say.i'm from the bay area, and i have to say he's one of the best.so cop this album and trust me you definitatly won't be disappointed!!! Slipped lipped, body snatchin', thugroovalishus, playa for playa, and ego trippy, E-40's has been my favorite rapper since he and the Click came &quot;Down 'N Dirty&quot; in the 90's. I like this one the best because my  favorite &quot;Fed-&quot; is on it, but anyone of E-Dollah Dawg's cuts are  good from any  of his or the Click's CDs... i own the new CD, Loyalty and betrayal and while that shit is sic wit it, this is by far the best CD E-feezy 40 fonzarelli from the bay has ever made. Every cut is playable and you can listen to the shit sraight thru without ever changin it. If you are readin this review to see what people say, let me just tell you that this CD is worth $30 instead of the 12 I paid. It is a classic for those of you who ride fo the best coast....","Pop Rap,Pop,R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Gangsta & Hardcore,West Coast,Funk",vallejo ca sound started memory click combine tales slangin rock beats sound like cutie pie computer love straight west coast even eastern rebels groove cuts like bumble hillside bad something different way english language never done hiphop lacking innovators e definition word love hate e long time veteran rap game seminal major way released really got e noticed mainstream audience pushed jive ultimately stuff money forthcoming next hall game rides line independent mainstream lines ridiculously well far rapping goes e top game boasting slang filled flow cunning wit arguably peak form notably best west coast rappers came suppor vallejo vallejo ca sound started memory click combine tales rock beats sound cutie cutie pie pie computer love straight coast eastern rebels groove cuts bumble hillside bad different way english english language language hiphop lacking innovators definition word love love hate hate long long time time veteran rap rap game game seminal major way released really got noticed mainstream mainstream audience audience pushed ultimately stuff money forthcoming hall game rides line independent mainstream lines ridiculously far rapping top game game boasting slang filled flow cunning wit arguably form notably best west west coast rappers coast rappers came
209,429,B00000052M,"Except for the first song, and that looped song, I love every song on this album, and that never happens! As for the first song, I won't say I hate it, I just don't find it that strong. I do, however, like bits of their early sound, with its distinct bass-y sound similar to The Smiths, especially on Tell Me (are The Smiths from Manchester, too?).My favorites are She Bangs the Drum and Fool's Gold, and What the World is Waiting For, if pressed. It's interesting how Oasis became so phenomenally popular, yet The Stone Roses, in my opinion, a superior and more intelligent band with stronger songs with better hooks was, well, just sorta phenomenally popular.It's just such a pity they ended it so quickly. That seems to happen with really good bands. Either they dissolve from inner band friction (uh, can you say, artistic differences?), or perhaps the lead singer overdoses. I'm glad that didn't happen, of course.By the way, did any of them join anyone good after this? There was  just so much talent!PS After a recent discovery, I MUST recommend ""The Very Best of The Stone Roses."" The songs are extended versions, and the pick of songs is amazing. This is good, though. This compilation collects all the Roses' work while shackled to the Silvertone label - their best stuff, in other words.  A few of these tracks are lifted straight from their eponymous debut, and the rest  are singles  and B-sides (some of these were also released on 'Turns  into Stone'.The  best works here are 'One love' (which is sadly truncated - faded out, no  less!), 'Fool's Gold' and the fondly-remembered 'She bangs the drum',  'Waterfall' and 'I am the resurrection' - all the  stuff of indie legend!  The more obscure tracks are surprisingly good too: 'Where angels play' is  beautiful, and 'Mersey paradise' shows  where Oasis got some of their  inspiration. All these reviews read like they are talking about the cd not this vhs tape.  Is it just the videos?  I would like to know what was on this tape.  If it is just the videos then a 3 out of 5 would work because half the videos were done by silvertone without the roses' permission and were made up of clips from previous videos, the blackpool concert, or just silly crap arty shots that were not by the band.  I would recommend the stone roses dvd, it has the videos, interviews, live performances, and the whole blackpool concert.  My favourite video was for love spreads.  Where can i get that one?  No where. Since someone asked here's what is on the video:Music promo videos (56 mins) of:Sally CinnamonElephant StoneMade of StoneShe Bangs The Drums(Song For My) Sugar Spun SisterStanding HereI Wanna Be AdoredWaterfallElizabeth My DearFools GoldOne LoveThe Roses live (58 mins) Aug. 12, 1988, at the Empress Ballroom, Blackpool, England:I Wanna Be AdoredElephant StoneWaterfall(Song For My) Sugar Spun SisterMade of StoneShe Bangs The DrumsWhere Angels PlayShoot You DownGoing DownMersey ParadiseI Am The ResurrectionYou can read the other reviews to get an overall feel of the video but, for me, the music videos were nothing special. The live stuff was good but certainly nowhere as good as seeing them live which I was able to do only twice in Tokyo. Mindblowing shows though esp. John Squire's guitar work. First, some corrections are in order pertaining to at least one of the former reviews.  Yes, ""complete"" Stone Roses is something of a misnomer but it must be recalled that the ""complete"" refers to their singles from their inception until the last decent thing they have done prior to the mediocre second coming era recordings.  Thus it spans from the mid-eighties (85 or 87, depending if one considers release dates, copyright dates or otherwise) up to '91.  That being said this compilation does not intend to be a retrospective as such, only a collection of a handful of very important recordings, and any layover between the tracks compiled here and the tracks on their self-titled debut are merely because these are singles.  And neither are they abriviated versions as such made for this collection. As ""singles,"" tracks generally need to fit within a certain format. Radio is not necessarily friendly to nine-plus minute anthems such as Fools Gold or I am the Resurection.  Indeed, some of the singles from their first album were edited down in the studio but others were actually rerecorded, or in the case of Elephant Stone, recorded as a single prior to the release of their album and then recorded again for their first album.Now on to the music proper.  The tracks are more or less in chronological order, diverging only slightly toward the end where 91's Where Angels Play is plotted prior to the Fool's Gold single and the One Love single.  The first two tracks are from the mid-eighties and represent their supposed 'Goth' period, however true or false that categorization might be.  I have read more than a few unfortunate descriptions of these tracks, calling them ""immature"" or ""not yet realized.""  To be sure, So Young and Tell Me are not quintessential Stone Roses, but as a first go it is interesting to here them, and, quite frankly, I see them as being quite good.  They are raw and powerful and, as I see it, are somewhat to the Stone Roses as This is Your My Bloody Valentine is to MBV; a gritty, pseudo-punk, slightly dark, and perhaps even fragmentarily reminiscent of a cross between the better goth stuff from that time and the Cramps.With the next single, Sally Cinnamon, The Stone Roses are beginning to come into their sound: sixties-ish pop with sweet lyrics--the b-side repeats, as if a mantra, the unforgettable lines ""I'd rather be no one than someone with no one.""After these early singles Roses fans familiar with the first album - as if a Roses fan could be unfamiliar with the first album - should find themselves in familiar territory.  Even the b-sides to some of the album tracks will likely not yeild too many suprises other than the shock of how good some of these songs are.  Some of the highlights are Going Down and Mersey Paradise, the former of which pays a nice homage to Jackson Pollack, reinstilling the fact that John Squire's aesthetic sensiblities are fully indepted to the yank ab-exer.Many of these songs I have heard before on vinyl but because of cost and rarety I was unable to get them.  It is a wonderful thing that this compilation exists.  At first I was afraid that the number of tracks also contained in one form or another on the first album would diminish my suprise or enthusiasm.  Not that I find those songs tired or hackneyed, but rather because I have heard them so many times I feared I might be tempted to skip ahead to the b-side songs.  This, however, was not the case.  As I remarked earlier, some of the tracks are different from the album version, but beyond that, hearing them in a different context, juxtaposed against their b-sides, is as refreshing an experience as it was when I heard these tracks for the first time over a decade ago.So, whether you are a hard-core Roses fan, a Madchester revivalist, or neophyte groove-meister, this collection is great to groove to or simply as an historical collection of some rare material of one of the most influential bands that barely made a ripple here in the States.  Too bad for us we've collectively bad taste, but let those select few who are disenfranchised with ...poor metal, tired American indie, and all-too-pop hip-hop, rejoice that there is enough interest in the good stuff to warrant the release and continued printings of the Roses. Th Stone Roses has their originality by their way of making their music.  Their rhythm andsound catches the public ear to be wild and groovy.  &quot;She bangs the drums&quot; is one of my favorites in the album. Keep  it up! All of these reveiws are being posted on the cd review page and on the video tape review page.  They are quite different products.I have listed what is on the tape by adding a picture to the video page. The CD was in new condition, as advertised, and the shipping was quite fast. I would deal with the seller again. Hmm...given that all the people who originally made the Stone Roses  popular were high on E at the time, this is actually surprisingly good  stuff.  I like even the early stuff, but Standing Here, She Bangs the  Drums, Fools Gold, and Something Burning are just plain great.  It may take  a few listens to fully appreciate, but it really is good.  The only real  downside is the amazingly sycophantic liner notes.And please, refrain  from sending me an angry e-mail informing me that you were an original fan  who did NOT, in fact, use ecstasy.  I'm making sweeping generalizations,  okay?  Calm down. Obviously everyone will have their own personal gripes about a comp when it comes out, the usual ""My favorite song wasn't included"" or ""This is an edited version or single version of such and such song"" etc..... Not much you can do about that but this is probably the most comprehensive Stone Roses comp you are likely to find and buying this will probably 1. Save you a fair bit of money because most of their classic songs are on this.  2.If you really do want to still buy their other stuff at least you know what you are getting.Much these days is made of them being the ""godfathers of Brit-pop"" etc etc.... Thing is, I always remember the Stone Roses playing second fiddle to the Happy Mondays (who were nothing in comparison to the Roses) and plus the fact that this was back in the day of the indie charts and John Peel when any new band could be guaranteed a fair shot even if they didn't have some big record company behind them.  The Roses to a large extent were able to bring in 2 audiences, the indie kids and the lads who were more Mondays 'Mad-Chester' inclined.Oasis have always talked this band up (Probably because they were 1000 times better than Oasis) and anyone who likes them really needs to check out the Roses.  All their best stuff is on this one and for the price it is selling you would be mad not to pick this one up.File under fans of Stereophonics, Oasis, Blur etc need this one. An excellent album, 2 great tracks - &quot;So Young&quot; and &quot;Tell Me&quot; are rougher than the debut album. All of the bsides almost surpass what is on that album.Note to reviewer below - Primal Scream formed at  the end of 1984 by Bobby Gillespie, drummer for the J + M Chain. Stone  Roses formed in the beginning of 1985. So really, PS were only together a  couple of months before the stone roses. It's The Stone Roses... what more do I have to say?  The tones on the album are just as sweet as you can get.  They have this auditory sensuality that comes through their music that makes listening to it that much more enjoyable.  I could listen to this over and over again... and I do! This &quot;best-of&quot; collection lets us see the Stone Roses take their first baby steps with a few early, dismal cuts of wannabe-Smiths, and then suddenly blossom into all-time-classic songwriters and performers. Every cut from &quot;Made of Stone&quot; on is indispensable. This is music that shines with an otherworldly light: archetypal 60s-British-Invasion quality pop but without a trace of revivalism or pastiche -- it simply sounds like songs that have existed all your life. Cool, gorgeous, transcendent. If these guys had been doing this back in the heyday of the Beatles and Stones, they would be equally revered now. That this album never caught on across the Atlantic is truly a shame: North America has no idea of the luminous, uplifting glory it's missing. Oasis, Blur, Charlatans UK, Catherine Wheel, My Bloody Valentine, Happy Mondays, etc..  If you want to know where Funky-Cool-Brit-Pop started... here it is. I have never heard, nor will I ever hear a more mystical and moving album as this one.  Every song, every lyric, every instrument is a religious experience.  Ian, John, Manni, and Reni work wonderfully together.  I would  recommend getting &quot;THE STONE ROSES&quot; before purchasing the  Complete Stone Roses though.  You get more out of the original.  In fact,  BUY THEM ALL!!!  You could NOT be sorry.  I promise. Love this band, they are so talented.  I can't stop playing it.  I'm particularly in love with ""Where Angels Play"", just elegant and beautiful. A collection of really good ones. A good cd that lets you get acquainted with the band. If you're a 60's raised teenager and you want to revisit the enthusiasm and sheer ""joy of playing"" that spawned your enduring love of music then look no further, ""The Complete Stone Roses"" has it... as close as you'll get  to recreating the experience of opening a subsequently ""classic"" 60's album  for the first time.This record (an excellent compilation, featuring the  best of the Stone Roses' early work and including ""tighter"" versions of  several tracks from their first album) makes you want to be where you once  were but where you couldn't be... about 18 in a Manchester club in 1990,  watching a group that your friends say you should see but few have heard  of. They don't sing too good (these studio recordings fortunately rectify  that), their format is straightforward (dominant lead guitar, strong snare,  tambourine &amp; bass, lots of vocal echo), their arrangements' follow a  well tried format but... they make ecstatic, often erratic music that makes  you feel alive... wonderful!You don't have to be young, to enjoy this. You  just have to love uplifting music. Like your long-eclipsed favourite band  on a good day this takes you there... not the same (although ""Waterfall""  could sit quite happily amongst the best of the Byrds' records), often  better (few 60's groups dared go anywhere near the brilliant rhythmic  complexities of ""Fools Gold"" or ""Elephant Stone"") but capturing that same  elusive ""magic"".To my daughter Katie... thank you for buying this record,  it's made an ""old boy"" very happy. This album is a classic - world class! Back when ""madchester"" or ""baggy"" or whatever-the-[heck]-it's-called was going on, I was probably about 11 or 12 years old, living in Massachusetts.  I had no concept of the music of my own countrymen (and women), let alone anything that was happening overseas.  Nirvana had yet to knock Michael Jackson off the pop charts, so my junior-high-school friends actually thought he was cool.  I think I had an M.C. Hammer tape lying around my room at the time.  The only inkling I had of great British music was the set of Beatles LPs owned (and infrequently listened to) by my parents- nothing I was going to delve into.So when I look at reviews analyzing how complete this collection really is, my eyes glaze over.  If only half these songs were on the disc, and the record label called it ""the complete stone roses,"" I'd say fine by me- a bit of a short disc- but no problems here.All that rambling to say this:  what we have here is truly, truly timeless music in its pursest form.  It's a moment of genius when everything came together for a band in a particular era and culture, and its brilliance carries the music far beyond its time and place to make it something that future generations will hopefully come back to and experience with the same awe that I had when I first heard it.By now you're probably rolling your eyes.  But the music here is THAT GOOD.  It's ""Revolver"" for the late 80s- and every bit as good as that loaded statement implies.  It created modern brit-pop.  I won't dissect it song by song because there is no point.  There isn't a weak link.  No matter when you are reading this review, you owe it to yourself to go and find a copy, and discover music that will always sound fresh.-HW The Stone Roses are a band that totally defies categorization.  At first listen, they sound almost naive and early 60's.  Listening to the lyrics, however, reveals a totally different orientation.  The music swirls with  the heavy emotion of a movement caught up within itself.  I'm from America  and so am used to hype and disappointment, but considering that I am 31  yrs. old and just discovering this magical elixir it is a wonder that I  find myself writing a positive advert. for such an &quot;old band&quot;.  Maybe it says alot about the way bands are broken over here stateside.  I've always been an anglophile when it comes to music, but I thought that  had reached it's zenithe with the awful tour Oasis staged in 1997.  Thank  God for the Verve and the now defunct Stone Roses for renewing my faith in  Brit-rock. First of all, a &quot;truth in advertising&quot; alert : this is not the &quot;complete&quot; Stone Roses. Far from it. This CD collects pretty much all their singles (A's and B's) and selected tracks from their first album, &quot;The Stone Roses&quot;. Many of these tracks are brilliant and the rest merely great, although one should be warned that some of the tracks are abbreviated single edits. For all this great music, though, the CD doesn't really hold together the way &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; CD does. &quot;The Complete Stone Roses&quot; is essential for SR fans, but new converts or the curious should definitely begin with &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; before picking this up. After you hear that CD you'll want to get the rest, including this one. ...of early singles and B-sides, non-album tracks, singles, and the like.  My one complaint is the inclusion of EDITED VERSIONS of I Am the Resurrection, Fools Gold, One Love, and Something's Burning....for full versions of the last two, check out the Turns to Stone album. This is a truly an outstanding album. After a friend recommended it to me I can't stop listening to it, definitely one of the albums of the century along with other Stone Roses stuff.Ian Brown and John Squire were a great  song-writing team and the rest of the band(Mani and Reni) along with them  are simply majestic geniuses. Buy this and the other Roses stuff or you are  missing out! The Stone Roses, headed by singer Ian Brown, were active in a period which spans from the late '80s to the early '90s. Simply put, they are one of UK's most relevant bands ever, having influenced countless so-called  &quot;brit-rock&quot; bands (Oasis, Embrace, Travis, Charlatans all owe  something to the SR, even if in fact they didn't attain their skill in the  least...) This cd is a great collection that comprehends their most  successful songs. A must-have if you like contemporary brit-rock (think  about the Verve...) This video is curiously out of its time, being released years after the Stone Roses peaked with the whole 'Madchester' scene in Great Britain.  For the fans, there's the fantastic &quot;Fool's Gold&quot; video, an interesting studio take of &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot;, and their infamous Late Show appearance.  But for the uninitiated, there's not a lot here to justify the narrator's obsequious narration and the Blackpool concert that forms the second half will do little to convince a new listener that the Roses were anything but a passable guitar band.  Furthermore, the video is lacking some key moments in Roses history like any concert footage whatsoever of the Spike Island event or the performance of &quot;Waterfall&quot; from The Other Side of Midnight (which was captured for the photographs on the inner sleeve of their debut album.)  Ultimately, this video feels like it was slapped together by their record company to cash in their fans' fading nostalgia before it disappears altogether and fails to do justice to one of the most profoundly influential bands of the late twentieth century. A collection of songs covering mainly the Stone Roses apex,the couple of years in which they were unarguably the best band on the planet.In their brief reign they managed to produce music which doesn't fall short in comparison with any of rock's classics.The momentum which they gained between 89/90 is something that no band will ever be able to reproduce,for the Stone Roses at that time passed more as messianic messengers than as rock stars,gathering an almost obsessioned following which hanged on their every words.It's only a measure of their worth the fact that no one else could have produced lines like&quot;I am the Ressurrection and I am the Life&quot;or&quot;I don't have to sell my soul,it's already in me&quot;without sounding arrogant or ridiculous;indeed these claims perfectly fitted the Stone Roses god like aura.The compilation focuses on their peak era music seamlessly blending the gems from their first album(in all truth the only amazing song missing from their debut is &quot;This is the One&quot;)and high quality B-sides,adding still their early singles,some of them quite distant from their habitual sound(the thrashing guitars of&quot;So Young&quot;and the minimalistic simplicity of the rocker &quot;Tell Me&quot;).One thing is for sure,they posessed the most cohesive band sound ever created with each element of the band connecting with the other with a fluid unity simply outstanding.Moreover Mani's bass,Reni's drums and Squire's guitar were no less than groundbreaking.Exceptional melodies come one after the other in this milestone in music history.Perfection perpasses every second of their songs in a dazzlingly unearthly way.The World should have been at their feet. Ok so that doesn't necessarily make it a bad CD but it's yet another attempt to wring some more cash out of essentially one album and a bunch of B-sides as I grew up calling them.Most of the stuff on here is fine although you're going to have to put up with a few edited versions in order to cram all the tracks on here. Sadly, as one may expect, Fools Gold is rudely chopped down to around 4 minutes to make it fit and I'm afraid I find that a crime.As an overview of the Stone Roses from 89-90 this isn't bad; it does have a number of tracks that you don't get on 'The Stone Roses'. One for the avid collectors, though. About one-half of ""The Complete Stone Roses"" includes all of the songs (except ""Simone"") comprising ""Turns to Stone,"" with the exception that ""Fools Gold"" (the full version, of course, is available on the U.S. version of the debut), ""One Love"" and ""Something Burning"" are abridged to eliminate most of the instrumental part, so that all 21 songs can fit.  In my review of ""Turns to Stone"" (which I also gave four stars) I mentioned how the early Stone Roses songs, as well as the B-sides, clearly demonstrate how they were influenced by poppy sixties bands such as Herman's Hermits and Gerry and the Pacemakers on the one hand, and psychedelic bands such as The Byrds and Jefferson Airplane on the other.  But, especially with their monumental debut album, the Stone Roses would incredibly expand their sound, and influence so many British bands that followed.My favorite songs on the album, that are not alternative takes, are ""Mersey Paradise"" and ""Sally Cinammon,"" which perhaps could have fit nicely in their debut.  The alternative takes are interesting from a creative point of view, but I think it's safe to say that the band chose superior versions for their remarkable first album (I don't hear any difference in this version of ""Made of Stone"").  ""Full Fathom Five"" is basically ""Elephant Stone"" in reverse, much the same way ""Don't Stop"" reverses ""Waterfall"" on the debut.  ""Something Burning"" is really just a mellower version of ""Fools Gold,"" and the closer, ""One Love,"" flirts dangerously with self-parody.Unless you're a diehard Stone Roses fan, who absolutely must possess their entire catalogue, I think you can just get ""The Complete Stone Roses"" and skip ""Turns to Stone."" This album is almost as good as their self-titled one (almost). The first two are very early tracks and don't hold up as well but after &quot;Sally Cinnamon&quot; it's pretty solid. Best tracks:Mersey Paradise, Standing  Here, What the World is Waiting For and One Love. Enjoy, because theres not  much Roses material to buy after this one. ....Especially if you were never lucky enough to get the original non-album singles, which is the lion's share of this compilation.  But be warned:  This is not a definitive greatest hits, as there is nothing from Second Coming.  It's a collection of the pre-Geffin singles.  Also, as they are the singles, the full length, album versions of Fools Gold and I Am the Resurrection have been forgone for the shorter single cuts (sans the jamming of the second halves).  Still, for an economic way to complete your collection if you have the first two albums, this will do quite nicely.","Alternative Rock,Shoegazing,Britpop,Indie & Lo-Fi,Dream Pop,Pop,British Alternative,Rock,Dance Pop",except first looped love every never happens first wont say hate dont find strong however like bits early sound distinct bass sound similar smiths especially tell smiths manchester favorites bangs drum fools gold world waiting pressed interesting oasis became phenomenally popular yet stone roses opinion superior intelligent band stronger better hooks well sorta phenomenally popular pity ended quickly seems happen really good bands either dissolve inner band friction uh say artistic differences perhaps lead singer overdoses im glad didnt happen course way join anyone good much talent ps recent discovery must r looped love happens wont say hate find strong bits early sound distinct bass sound similar especially tell favorites bangs drum fools fools gold gold world waiting pressed interesting oasis phenomenally popular stone stone roses roses opinion superior intelligent band stronger better hooks phenomenally popular pity ended quickly seems happen really good bands dissolve inner band friction say artistic differences lead lead singer singer overdoses glad happen course way join good talent ps recent discovery
210,430,B00000052Y,"From the instant this album starts with props to KRS from just about every Old School rapper, DJ or figure you can think of, you know that this is going to be an album with distinct nods to the past. When you see who features on some of these tracks (Fat Joe, Channel Live, Das EFX and Mad Lion), you know that the album's going to look forward to the future.KRS is one of hip-hop's elder statesmen, having made his mark as frontman for Boogie Down Productions (&quot;The Bridge Is Over&quot;), with this album he registers two solo albums as well. As a result of his experience, he knows what he's talking about - when he claims &quot;Rappers R N Dainja&quot; or &quot;MCs Act Like They Don't Know&quot; he means it.Another feature of his vintage is that he comes from a time when MCs lived and died by the lyrics they recited, not by the catchiness of a hook or funk of a beat. Thus, he is able to preach his sociological messages while still making superb rhymes. If anyone doubts his sociological qualifications, he has done many lecture tours and (&quot;wrote over 1000 rhyme hooks/and sociological books/while you were worrying about your looks&quot;).One slight downside to KRS-ONE's style is that the abrasive nature of his voice can sometimes get irritating, it's a good thing then that he has brought in rappers with distinctive styles and voices to balance his. This practice does have its downside though, &quot;De Automatic&quot; is one of the stronger tracks on the album but the outro has the only appearance of Fat Joe repeating the words &quot;The south Bronx/The south south Bronx&quot;, which seems to interrupt the flow a bit. The same is slightly less true for &quot;Wannabemcees&quot; where Mad Lion's distinctive toasting style only turns up in the outro (at least it is more grabbing than Fat Joe's rap).The best tracks on the album would probably be &quot;Wannabemcees&quot;, &quot;De Automatic&quot; and &quot;Hold&quot; (in which KRS tells a story with one of the most amazing rhyme schemes ever recorded). Honorable mention would go to &quot;MCs Act Like They Don't Know&quot; where, over a DJ Premier beat, KRS does a version of Kurtis Blow's intro to &quot;The Breaks&quot; (&quot;Clap your hands everybody if you've got what it takes/Coz I'm KRS and I'm on the mike and Premier's on the breaks&quot; as opposed to &quot;Clap your hands everybody if you've got what it takes/Coz I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know that these are the breaks&quot;).On the whole, KRS-ONE delivers another sterling performance, highlighted by amazing use of the mike and a great instinct to give the people what they want - straight up with a twist. To date, NO ONE can mess with Krs-OneFrom Emcees Act Like They Don't know-- on-- he TORE everyone up w/ this album..and continue to do so today.. His latest 2010 album, with Greenie -- is probably one of the wildest and most unique things he's done yet-- Krs-One.. ROCK ON ! There was a time when KRS-ONE would come out with an album and before hearing any tracks off of it, I would buy it with no hesitation, knowing that it was going to be a masterpiece. This worked for his first 7 Albums. This one ended that streak. I have the utmost respect for KRS, he in my mind is the greatest MC in the history of hip hop. He dropped 7 straight hip hop classics (7 including Live:Hard Core World Wide) but this album was straight up weak and disapointing. It's starts out great, the first track Rappaz are in danga is bangin, I played that over and over again, but it goes all down hill after that. In many of his albums, KRS has and changes his styles, and 9 out of 10 times this is dope, but it seemed that on this one, he was all over the place. Using the same type of style, but changing it slightly for certain tracks. Where for instance on Edutainment or Sex &amp; Violence he had completly diffrent styles on certain tracks. The production  is suspect, and surronding himself with  channel live and fat joe didn't help him in my opinion. There is one track with Busta Rhymes in it, but it falls short of the potential of what it could of been. (Case in point: In &quot;I get wreck&quot; w/Tim Dog, who is a weak MC, Krs-1 carried that and made it one of the greatest jams of all time, imagine what he could of done with Busta Rhymes) Also, this album is where KRS started to change his philosophies. In his previous albums, he was pretty consistant with them. Now after this album and his later one, he changes philosophies like I change my draws. Some of his interviews after this were, well, interesting. This album proved to me that KRS-1 is mortal. Fortunatly the one after this &quot;I Got Next&quot; is much, much, better. This gets a 2 on the Mark D Hype scale. (Check the about me section for more details on the scale.) The only reason he does not get a 1 is because of who he is, and what he has done, but this is a mad weak album. This is the teacher's self-titled album contains more lessons, and upliftment for African-Americans.  DJ Premier's production on ""Rappaz R. N. Dainja"" and ""MC's Act Like They Don't Know"" was are great East Coast hip-hop feel displaying Krs' lyricisim.  ""Ah-Yeah"" displays his consciousness of scociety's problems.  As automatic as his flow on ""De Automatic""  featuring Fat Joe.  ""...stack some money for a video, I don't have any. You're looking at the last emcee with true talent..."" he put it into perspective with ""Build Ya Skillz"".  This release is a presentation of plain hip-hop.  Nothing commercial just ""R.E.A.L.I.T.Y."" through the eyes of Bronx own Krs-One. The Joy of MagicThe song ""The Truth"" on this album was my breakthrough in terms of opening my mind to spiritual concepts and seeing the truth about life and humanity. It had a tremendous effect on me and the person I have become.Other great songs like ""MC's Act Like They Dont KNOW"" and ""Rappa R N Danja"" put this in the ranks of a classic in the genre for me personally. Great music and message from the one and only KRS ONE Hip Hop Vs. Rap was the origonal name of this album before Krs-One self titled his '95 album. This is one of those albums that shows why the east coast had dominated this rap game in the mid 90's, even though during that year the west coast peaked with such banging album. Not to mention being in the game for such a long time, Kris was one of those emcees with his socially concious lyrics, who was ahead of his time, and would reach his peak with this album here.No matter what way or how he does it, he gets the job done. Talking about how the fake emcees are making albums, and he's ready to get them on ""Rappaz R. N. Danja"", an idea carried over from the song ""Outta Here"" from his previous albumReturn of the Boom Bap. He has major energy on dope tracks like ""Ah-Yeah"" and ""R.E.A.L.I.T.Y."". And there are tracks that explains why he is The Teacha of hip hop, on the song that questions religion ""The Truth"". Even the guests bring their A game as well, such as Das Efx on ""Reperesent The Real Hip Hop"", and Channel Live on ""Free Mumia"" (Kris, I hope you're not defending the slave record company). Other guests like Busta Rhymes and Fat Joe, do ad libs on the songs that they appear on. All throughout the album there are a few drops and shoutouts from artists and DJ's from different radio stations.Even the production will keep you intuned. DJ Premier flies in the dope headbanger ""MC's Act Like They Know"", and ""Wannabeemceez"". Showbiz and Diamond D, as well as others brings in come dope beats for this album here.Kris' self titled album is great like I said. Each song here shows why he is one of the best in the game. Somehow he still manages to get his point across with his dope rhymes, not to mentioned backed by some great producers. If you haven't heard any other solo albums, also check outReturn of the Boom Bapas another hot album by Kris. Caution: Don't Sleep. Peace.Lyrics: A+Production: AGuest Appearances: AMusical Vibes: ATop 5 Tracks:1. MC's Act Like They Know2. Free Mumia (featuring Channel Live)3. Represent The Real Hip Hop (featruing Das Efx)4. The Truth5. Ah-YeahHonorable Mention:1. Hold2. R.E.A.L.I.T.Y. The best album he's done in my opinion, infact, he really began to get soft shortly after this. For his second solo album, KRS-One worked with a variety of younger hip-hop talents, perhaps in an attempt to resuscitate his street credibility and his commercial standing. Featuring appearances by Das EFX, Mad Lion, Fat Joe, and Channel Live, KRS-One is loaded with fresh talent of the first-rank and they help spark the Teacher into giving an inspired performance. The album also showcases a bit fuller production than Return of the Boom Bap, but that doesn't mean he has sold it out -- it just means he's continuing to experiment, which is one of the reasons KRS-One remained a vital artist nearly a decade after his first record. Congrats, Chris! Very Good CD and it is worth buying. Song #9 (Represent the Real Hip-Hop) Was a very good song. It was Awesome! Ah Yeah Was also a very good song. It may be a little Mature for kids under 12, but otherwise it is a great all-round CD. I would reccomend this CD with all my Heart. Awesome Work Chris! The general opinion of this album seems to be that this is the best KRS has done so far. I would have to agree 100%. The beats and rhymes have not been repeated by himself before or after this no matter how hard he may have tried. Lyrics-wise KRS1 has always come correct, rhyming with clarity, purity, intelligence and skill. Beats-wise he's not that bad either and on this album he's better than that. Dj Premier produces 3 of the best songs Ive ever heard KRS do with ""Rappaz R. N. Dainja"", ""MC's Act Like They Don't Know"" and ""Wannabemceez"". The beats are simply soul shaking to put it mildly. The rhymes are delivered with real drive on virtually all the joints apart from the more laid back ones like ""Ah-Yeah"" (which I wasnt really feeling), ""Hold"" (masterful wordplay), ""Squash All Beef"" and ""Health, Wealth, Self"" (simply uplifting). I think tracks like ""R.E.A.L.I.T.Y."", ""Free Mumia"", ""The Truth"", ""Build Ya Skillz"" and ""Out For Fame"" are all amazing and only strengthen the album even more. Outstanding from start to finish. Apart from ""Ah-Yeah"" and ""De Automatic"" its perfect. KRS-One (self titled)Released in the fall of 1995, KRS-One's self-titled LP (technically his second solo effort) hit stores at a time when hip-hop was still dominated by the East/West rivalry of factions like Death Row Records and Bad Boy Records.  The 80's era ""old school"" were waning from public view as the then-current rap stars were taking the spotlight--not just with their records, but with their run-ins with the law.  By the mid-90's it wasn't hip to be a `teacher' so much as it was to be a ""thug"" or ""gangsta"".A vocal critic of the widespread trend of the ""video superstar"", on ""MC's Act Like They Don't Know"", KRS confronts this dilemma--""You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player, but make sure live you are a dope rhyme-sayer.."" In other words, whatever your `role' is in rap, be sure to be an engaging performer.  ""Ah, Yeah!"" is a militant tribute to the Black Panthers; ""Squash All Beef"" warns people to avoid the fatal consequences of holding grudges, ""Represent the Real Hip-Hop"" teams the artist with Das EFX.Other artists providing cameos either on or in-between recordings include Fat Joe, Busta Rhymes, and even MC Hammer.  The production is largely handled by DJ Premier, Showbiz and Diamond D, along with the artist.  A re-release of this album should include some of the remixes done, including the rare ""Rappaz R N Dainja/Chain Me to the Gear"" remix by Audioslave's Tom Morello. I've purchased this album from along time , but I thought to drop a review.But I already read some nice reviews by other members , all I have to add is that the one who thinks that KRS-ONE is someone who is hipocrete , is someone who looks to HipHop from Lil Jon view.Peace. HA HA those were the days Krs one is the greatest battle MC of all time and if you listen to Hiphop Mainstream or underground and dont own one of his albums then you need to get with the program Hops Because whoever your favorite mc is whether it be Beanie seagall, Jay-Z, NAS, Talib Kweli, Capitol D, C-rayz Walz, Mos-DEF, or Akrobatic these MCs and thousands of other were directly influenced by Krs Ones Rhyme style. If that doesnt make him the greatest MC of all time I dont know what does. Lyricly Kris has always brought it but this album is a personal favorite on the lyrical tip. I consider this to be one of the greatest lyrical albums of all time. Beats are provided by DJ premier which is always a plus. Kris' rhyme style worked really well with preimos production it would be really sweet if they could get back together and produce another album. If your looking for a truly dope lyrical and musical album it really doesnt get much better than this. He slapped you in your face and said HAHA!!What year was this? 1995? I remember getting this together withthe KRS produced The Real Ting by Mad Lion, that was BDP?s year, without a doubt.Whatever year that was. Good thing I stopped smoking weed. I have seen KRS-One on television for as long as I can remember, talking about hip hop and rapping in his videos.  Also, when people speak of some of the best artists hip hop has ever seen, his name is often mentioned.  I never took the time to listen to him with my undivided attention because I was so young when his music was popular.  I finally listened to his self-titled album and was truly amazed at every aspect.There are no weak songs on this album. Here you will find real hip-hop.  Real hip hop beats that will have you bobbing your head uncontrollably.  Real hip hop lyrics about both positive and negative aspects of life.  For example, in ""Squash All Beef"", KRS is telling his listener the virtue in dealing with confrontations without violence.  This is such a positive message because in hip-hop, there is a vortex of negative energy.  Rap artists are constantly talking about who they have killed, who they want to kill, and who they should kill.  It becomes sickening after awhile.  To hear KRS say ""squash all beef"" was so refreshing.  That song is very real and positive; I commend him for his maturity.  ""Out For Fame"" and ""Ah Yeah"" are good tracks, too.  ""Ah Yeah"" is definitely controversial, but the lyrics are so powerful.I highly recommend this album to fans of hip-hop/rap music.  I finally see the difference between a hip-hop album and a REAL hip-hop album.  Because, in essence, hip-hop has more than one aspect.  There has to be a certain energy in the artist's voice, the beat has to sound a certain way, and the lyrics have to hit some in some way.  KRS-One passed the REAL hip-hop test with flying colors.  I will definitely be listening to much more of him.  4 shining shars.Mikeisha's Top 51. ""Wannabeemcez""2. ""MCs Act Like They Don't Know""3. ""Wealth, Health, Self""4. ""Ah Yeah""5. ""Squash All Beef"" I am a fan from the BDP days of KRS.His self titled release here was a bit slept on at the time.I think Boom Bap was just so cool and groundbreaking that when this came on people wanted more of that sound.Now that nearly 10 years have passed this album stands up very well.Especially with this Blinged out era its almost like crawling into a time capsule.The hottest joint Mc's Act Like They Don't Know could put any rhyme out there today on its back by itself.Thats not even the hardest cut on a emcee basis.Check out Build Ya Skills with Busta Rhymes, thats some whoop ass for ya.DJ Premier probably did some of his finest work on this album.KRS also blended his productions nicely too.If you are KRS fan this can't dissapoint. One of the best hip-hop albums EVER!!  From the moment you hear the crushing battle-song ""MC's Act Like They Don't Know"", to the powerful track ""Ah-Yeah"" to the deep metaphorical ""Hold"", this is KRS' supreme statement and you can really feel that he knows and understands his own lyrical/musical power.  I started to get so tired in 2004 of the club rap, sex-oriented shallow rap, and lament now the art-form itself as it seemed to have crumbled... where is Public Enemy?  Grandmaster Flash?  KRS?  Poor Righteous Teachers?  The art form has been so co-opted by the media that they destroyed it in it's higher forms.  If you're interested in hearing rap at it's height purchase this album while it's still in-print. How is this not 5 Stars??? There is way too many 4 Stars for this album but besides that Mr. KRS-One has delivered possibly the best hip hop CD of 1995 the singles were bangin ""Rappaz R N Danja"" starts the album off perfect with premier on the track you can't go wrong ""Ah Yeah"" has a killer drum beat and is one of my favorites from the album, MC's Act Like They Don't Know"" is the hardest track KRS ever did and definitely is Premiers top produced track ""Free mumia"" is dope as hell KRS produced this himself ""Hold"" is KRS describing a gun and what it means to hold one classic track ""The Truth"" a song about religion and who where the first human beings on earth which is we all know Adam and Eve ""Build ya skills"" a dope track featuring Busta Rhymes classic feature right here but enough talk go out and buy this album it truly is KRS-One best solo album post BDP era. and the greatest in my opinion.KRS ONE self titled solo album is a GEM... I'm not gonna go over every single track on the album but the versatility kris brings on this album is nothing short of legendary... the Michael Jordan of hip- hopthe album has some of the most uniquely fantastic songs that i'll remember for the entirety of my life...you dont even have to be a hip -hop fan to like and respect this album... its music at its finestKRS ONE is a MUST BUY! The most blazing cuts-  &quot;Rappaz R N Dainja&quot; (also try to find the rare remix by Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello!); &quot;Ah, Yeah!&quot;; &quot;Squash All Beef&quot;, &quot;Represent the Real&quot;,  with Das EFX.&quot;Out for Fame&quot; gives props to graffiti artists.  Dope production tactics by DJ Premier, Diamond D, and cameos by Fat Joe,  Busta Rhymes, and a who's who of hip-hop personalities!One of 1995's  best albums, but still slept on!!  Go buy this record! this is a classic album, and it's krs-one's best, it includes the well known hit single  mcs act like they don't know, but my favorite song was represent the real hip hop, this is a must have album, it made '95 one of hip hop's best years. This is the last time I was able to identify with what KRS was saying as he lost me a bit on his subsequent efforts (especially his forays into gospel rap).  This album is outstanding top to bottom, although Krs' lack of a rhythmnic voice is still something that keeps me from listening to his albums constantly.  There is no need for singing obviously but his gruff jutting style puts him in the category (for me of course) of artists who i have to be in a certain mood to listen to. Chilling slightly edgy music though remains his strength, and tracks like De Automatic and Wannabemceez make this a testament to the greatest time period in hip hop, the early 90's. ok . this kinda' threw me off a bit compared to his 'younger' albums . it was a MUCH MUCH harder sound and lyrics were harder . wasn't quite sure whats goin on? anyway , i realized i grew out of this phase of life and spiritually there were alot of things i couldn't get with .but,oh well thats life. Krs one's ""krs one"", is one of my favorites albums by krs & also my favorite cd in my collection, because i feel this album is deeper then anything i've heard in my life. Im a huge huge fan of krs works and his lirycs and his production is just amazing. Support Krs one! He's the truth! One thing's certain: If you're trying to find out why KRS is considered by many to be one of the greatest emcees of all time, look no further than his self-titled 1995 album, ""KRS-One."" The Blastmaster kicks scathing battle rhymes (""MCs Act Like They Don't Know"") over hardcore, boombastic beats (""Rappers R N Danja"") and proves why he is THE definition of an emcee by FREESTYLING his verses on the album's main criticism of fake emcees, ""Wannabemceez."" Elsewhere KRS explores the frustrated ghetto mind (""Hold""), encourages blacks to use compromise over killing (""Squash All Beef""), questions orthodox Christianity (""The Truth""), and puts a muzzle on rap critics (""Free Mumia""). To understand the overall tone of the album, an excerpt from ""Rappers R N Danja"":""I remember thinkin' back to '83, no video no you had to be a real live emcee! Now you youngins grow up buggin, any new jock your huggin,' weak production, let me tell you somethin: Any emcee can battle for glory, but to kick a dope rhyme to wake up your people's another story. Act like you never saw me, cauz when it comes to lyrics, I'm in a different category!""Cop this album today and enlighten yourself.","Gangsta & Hardcore,Pop Rap,Rap & Hip-Hop,Pop,East Coast",instant starts props krs every old school rapper dj figure think know going distinct nods past see features fat joe channel live das efx mad lion know going look forward future krs one hip hops elder statesmen made mark frontman boogie productions quot bridge quot registers two solo well result experience knows hes talking claims quot rappers r n dainja quot quot mcs act like dont know quot means another feature vintage comes time mcs lived died lyrics recited catchiness hook funk beat thus able preach sociological messages still making superb rhymes anyone doubts sociological qualifications done instant starts props krs old old school school rapper dj figure think know distinct nods past see features fat fat joe joe channel channel live live das das efx efx mad mad lion lion know look forward future krs krs one hip hip hops hops elder elder statesmen statesmen mark frontman boogie productions bridge quot registers solo result experience knows talking claims rappers quot quot mcs act know quot means feature vintage comes time mcs lived died lyrics recited catchiness hook funk beat able preach sociological messages superb rhymes doubts sociological qualifications

What is so impressive with hes work on this album is that it is obvious he wanted to create an awesome do or die atmosphere in his sound to go with hes rhymes and he succeeds big time.  The album isnt 100% perfect though.  Hes 2 big let downs on this master piece are sound of lead and you aint knowin.  Mild and dull, however all other tracks hit ya in that funky place.  The title track has a spankin beat that whips to a deep bass line as you would expect from Banks.  There is a struck match for the next best track as songs 3,5,8,9,10 all get my body moving and the other tracks while arnt as deeply funky still have that atmosphere around them.  I gave this a 5 star because its hard to expect any producer to get it 100% right but this is close enough to warant such a rating. Just as Dr. Dre had been producing and rapping down in the LA area, Ant ""The Big Bad Ass"" Banks had been doing the same up in the bay.  He is an excelent producer and comes up with some of the hottest westcoastin' beats you can find. Of course he produces for bay vets Too $hort, E-40, Spice 1, and too many others to mention.  He seems to have the magic touch for music.  His third Album ""Do or Die,"" is no exception.  It's laced with some of the neatest G-Funk beats ranging from the menacing, hard rollin beats of ""Ain't No Thang"", and ""Hi Speed Anthem"" to relaxing and more upbeat ""No Time Fa BS.""  This album is perfect for blasting while rollin with the top down and joy ridin with the homies.

212,432,B000000536,"Celly Cel is a Bay Area vet who despite an impressive discography never quite received the acclaim of his buddies E-40 and Spice 1. His 1995 sophomore effort ""Killa Kali"" is an excellent album of top-notch Bay Area hip hop. Celly's not a lyrical visionary, but he's an appealing rapper because he has style, a good flow and delivery, and a commanding presence on the mic. He raps about what he knows, and most of the time that consists of life in the Bay, hustling, and violence. He delivers good hooks and overall makes a nice performance. What sets ""Killa Kali"" apart from the sea of Bay Area albums from the mid-90s is the production. The music carries a distinctly Bay Area sound, with the choppy and bass-heavy beats and whiny instrumentals, but it is more melodic, smoother, and catchier than most of Celly's brethren's. The beats are funky and have a clean polish.""Killa Kali"" is one of those albums that is so consistent, not much stands out. But that's definitely a good thing; you'll be hard-pressed to find any flaws in this well-executed LP. Celly is a likable rapper and the beats are awesome, among the best from the left coast in the fine year of '95. Guest appearances are strong, and unlike some of the weirder stuff that came from the Bay during this period, it has a wide appeal and rap fans of all types will enjoy the funky tracks.After the intro, Celly spits some menacing lyrics on the nice ""What U N...z Thought,"" and trades off verses with E-40 on the Bay Area thumper ""4 tha Scrilla."" The single ""It's Goin' Down"" is just an awesome track, boasting a perfect laidback g-funk beat with woozy electronic elements and a great performance from Celly, profiling a day in the life. ""Can't Tell Me S..."" has some hard-hitting production, and ""Tha Bullet"" is a surprising concept track, with verses coming from the perspective of a gunshot bullet. My favorite song is the Spice 1 collaboration ""Red Rum,"" because the two MCs display such great chemistry. The production shines on ""Skanlezz Azz B...z"" and ""Remember Where You Came From,"" and the latter is a catchy track that supplies one of Celly's better performances. The title track is a potent West Coast anthem on all fronts, while ""Playerizm"" is slow-rolling. The closer ""Funk Season"" is a highlight, with Celly showing a tight flow over a nice beat.""Killa Kali"" isn't revolutionary by any means, but Celly puts together a great album with tight beats and good performance. This is one of the very best LPs to emerge from the Bay Area explosion in the mid-90s, standing tall with the best albums from E-40, Spice 1, and the Young Black Brotha roster. '95 saw so many classic LPs that ones like this often get overlooked, but the tracks on ""Killa Kali"" have the spirit that made '95 such a great year for hip hop. I highly recommend this album to West Coast fans. This album sets the standard along with RBL Posse's first 2 albums . Incredible mic skill and unbeatable production make this a must have !!! THIZ ALBUM IZ DOPE ALL THA WAY THRU-DEFINETE CLASICC JUS LIKE ALL HIZ OTHERZ-RAW FLOWZ W/OG DELIVERY & SUPER CLEAN BEATZ-DONT SLEEP & MAKE SURE 2 PEEP ALL THAT OTHER SIC WIT IT RECORDS $HIYIT Back in early '96, I remember watching the classic video &quot;It's Goin' Down&quot; on rap city while I was in college and I said to myself I've got to go and find this CD and I did a couple of weeks later. This CD from top to bottom is just dope with &quot;Round 2 Intro&quot;. K-Lou does most of the production on this CD which makes this CD an instant g-funk classic. Some of the other tracks that just brings this CD to the forefront is &quot;Killa Kali&quot; & &quot;Skanless A** B******&quot;, & &quot;Funk Season&quot;. So go ahead and order your copy if you love g-funk. Celly Cel's Killa Kali is a dope record. A lot of Hip Hop/Rap Fans Sleep On Dude, and I can't understand why? If you love gangsta rap music and don't have this, you've been missin out on one of the best albums in the genre. A++ Dope west coast album, I'd heard of it for a long time and finally found it and decided to give it a try and it turns out to be dope, definently a night album though, most of the beats are slow and real funky, it's definently a west coast album, sick This album is filled wit some tight lryics and beats. Celly Cel put down some pretty cool hardcore rap in dis album. It is worth checking out and if you are a SickWidIt Records fan then you will like dis one. Any questions  you wish to ask me go ahead and ask me at yuckplace@hotmail.com If your looking for a funky ass west coast classic look no further. This is the only CD of Cell's that I've heard and take my word for it, every single track has a awesome beat and Celly Cell tears it up on the mic.This CD is a straight up mid-90s west coast classic.COP IT!! I first heard of Celly Cel on E-40's In A Major Way. Then a certain music company(who I'm not at liberty to say their name)had his album for sale so I purchased it and was pleasantly surprised. Celly Cel can flow and the production team behind him is serious. What U N****z Thought is the hard edged opener as Celly Cel drops some good rhymes over a hard beat. In Tha Bullet(creative concept) he talks about being a bullet and all the damage it causes. He has two songs with guest appearances 4 Tha Scrilla(featuring E-40 and B-Legit) and Redrum(featuring Spice 1)both of which are standouts. He also drops you a gem on Remember Where You Came From as he tells the consequences of what happens when you forget where you came from. There is no fillers although I dont like the screwed up voice in the hook for Funk Season. Bottom Line: Celly Cel's Killa Kali is his best album and is definetly a highlight underground album for 96. Celly Cel can be added to the long list of underrated MCs from the west coast(Yukmouth, C-Bo, Xzibit etc). Standout tracks: WHAT YOU N****Z THOUGHT, 4 THA SCRILLA, ITS GOIN DOWN, THA BULLET, REDRUM, SKANLEZZ AZZ B*****Z, KILA KALI and FUNK SEASON. GREAT CLASSIC CD. NOTHING LIKE THIS IS STILL AROUND. THIS WAS FROM THE YEARS WHEN RAPPERS RAPPED ABOUT REAL LIFE. NOT LIKE TODAYS MUSIC Great c.d!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes real west coast rap.  The original &quot;It's going down&quot; is a classic too. The o.g.'z TODAY remember this album. THHIS IS A CLASSIC NO ONE CAN TOUCH. EVERYBODY SHOULD GET  THIS.PEACE Celly Cel really does his thug thang on this album!  He throws in his complex, loud, and often fast flow over tight G-Funk beats.  A standout track is ""What U N----z Thought."" The song is laced with some of the hardest beats and rhymes in gangsta rap.  A menacing foreground beat with a Dr Dre'ish whiny keyboard synth in the background.  He sounds really angry and crazy on that song.  ""It's Goin Down"" is a lot slower.  It has a nice slow jam beat with the occasional faint use of a talk box reciting: ""It's goin down"" during the hook.  Throughout the album, he shows the harder side of California life! Back in the day everyone was bumpin Celly Cel and today he is still got it  goin on with his old school beats and up beat lyrics you just can't top  this gansta. His g-funk bass and smooth flow make it still go down tonight  and any night, so if you know rap like no other you should have no problem  fallin for his bomb stylings.

213,433,B00000053B,"ONE OF HIS BEST ALBUMS MOST SONGS ARE GOOD CAN LEAVE IT ON FROM START TO FINISH AND NOT GET BORED After establishing himself as a strong solo presense on12 Playthis album really does distance R.Kelly from any semblance of New Jack swing that remained on his earlier recordings. Much as with Mary J'sMy Lifethis album is part of a series of recordings that swing the genre of hip-hop/R&B; into more of a fluid groove that showcases a mixture of modern touches as live instruments. As with the ""sermon"" on the intro this is an album where R.Kelly really began to involve himself in the age old soul music tradition of blending the spiritual with the secular-consistantly pulling a very Al Green style lyric tag throughout this album at the drop of a hat by pleading to jesus and pleading for romance all at the same time. During this era this comes as something of a surprise as often enough the two concepts seemed to play out more seperately than together. Overall,from song to song there's a strong similarity to most of the cuts on this album. Except for some very shallow lyrics on ""You Remind Me Of Something"" this album largely focuses it's attention on on midtempo songs with light hip-hop beats. It worked dynamite in the day and usually,aside from occasions where it worked better as a single the songs on this album all kind of flow together as one statement. Some songs such as the intricately textured ""Religious Love"" feature an interesting mix of percussion and modern beats wheras ""Trade In My Life"" really bought the pretty full on gospel out of the box completely. Of course,to me the strongest cuts on the album are the full blown disco-funk arrangements of ""(You To Be) Be Happy) with Notorious B.I.G and that excellent ""Thank God It's Friday""-both of which showcase the type of sound that R would begin to explore to a far broader degree (and with a huge creative leap ahead in his musical career) in the albums to come. R Kelly is still not at the apex of his career with this album. There's still a bit of (mildly) dated hip-hop productions here and there but when this album cooks it char broils and is an excellent,if quickly executed beginning to the second phase of R.Kelly's musical career. I RECEIVED MY R. KELLY CD ..VERY QUICKLY. THE CD WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. THIS IS A #1 SALESPERSON, SURELY WILL BUY AGAIN. R.kelly is the world greatest there can only be one him.He was  given a gift by GOd and no one would ever take it away from him.His got the ability to express himself he is in touch with his feelings,in all levels sexualy ,psychologically and emotionaly.He also inspire people and given them grounds to stand and make me understand that what Iam feeling is normal.Poeple might try to bring him down ,but with him keeping his head up nothing will stand on his way.With his fans ,family friends and ancestars nothing will get on his ways.I would give every thing to see him on a plain to South Africa.I love R. KELLY he gives meaning to life and make life worth living , it might sound like I am making him the second God, but Iam not he is a God in the music .We all make mistakes lets not look at his wrong doings lets look at what he does to build the nation and lets pray to God to help him see to his wrong doings and keep on inspiring him to give us more music and feed our souls. R.kelly I love you ,God bless you. R. Kelly's self titled third album and second solo release has everything the others have with more exploring of his boundaries and even spirituality as done on ""Intro - the Sermon"", ""Heaven If You Hear Me"", ""As I Look Into My Life"" and ""Trade In My Life"".  R. takes it to a club scene with ""Hump Bounce"" as he states ""...everyday, every night humpin' and bouncin' is all I wanna do...""  ""You Remind Me Of Something"" is a mid-tempo tune where he compares a woman to a jeep, his sound, his cars and his bank account.  She must be something especially nice then.  The mood changes to a bit more sexual atmosphere with the inviting ""Step In My Room"" and he makes offers to anything you want on ""Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby...""  The classic love or anti-love song with 70 feels about creeping on ""Down Low (Nobody Has To Know)"" featuring Ronald & Ernie Isley.  He then begs for forgiveness and wants his lover to come back with ""I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)"".  ""Thank God It's Friday"" has the same feel of his later hit ""Step In The Name Of Love"".  To the rescue, he comes in with ""Love Is On The Way"" for another mid-tempo bass filled song.  ""Religious Love"" is simple and have feelings of depths undiscovered for a single person as he prays for love.  He slows the motion to almost still as the lights turn down low on ""Tempo Slow"".  The sixteen songs which were written and produced by R. Kelly seem never-ending and on the other hand it seems too short.  But it will be kept on repeat. This cd starts off with slow beats and features B.I.G and a couple others. Thats all there is to know. My favorite song is probably Thank God It's Friday the 90s r&b; genre belonged to robert kellygreat cd that brings back good memories from the best decade.i bought the cd because i didnt want the digital format.classics should be in CD format ! I still haven't received this item and I would not recommend this company to anyone! If u like R. Kelly this album is a must-have. This album as beat all of his past and present albums. with songs like ""religious love"" and ""thank god its friday"" still stand as some of the best songs he has ever recorded. i remember listening to this album when it first came out and thinking this is the best thing i have ever heard.(and i was only 10) that tells u how good of an album it is if a 10 year old was listening to it. like i said before if u like r. kelly u gotta get this album! With his thrid CD in three years, R.Kelly delivered more of his usual antics. While this CD had it's moments it also had it's share of weak moments. The strong moments were the ballads which he's always known for. The first trio of ballads the hit single You Remind Me Of Something, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby and my personal favorite Step In My Room show R's vocals and writing at it's best. The next two strong ballads Down Low (Nobody Has To Know) and ""I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)"" were also good , although the remixes were better. The other strong ballads  Tempo Slow was placed at towards the end of the CD but it was placed in the middle of R. Kelly's religous section of the CD. Very few albums out at the moment are so good that you can listen to it from start to finish. Although this is far more mellow and laid-back than just about all of Kelly's other albums, the consistant quality of the songs make this a treat to the ears.Kelly has said that it was around this time that he discovered God. God really must have inspired him, as it is far greater than his previous work (although 12 Play is a classic).Just about the best ballad Kelly ever wrote (&quot;I Can't Sleep Baby (If I) is probably the best song on the album, followed closely by the mid tempo &quot;Thank God It's Friday&quot;. The multi-octave style of Marvin Gaye can be seen used here. It is a pity Kelly doesn't use it anymore.If you are just getting into his work and are not going for the more hardcore elements of &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot;, get this album as it will really open the door to what tis guy is trying to say. R.Kelly album is wonderful, exciting, loving , and real R&amp;B! He is tha King! i cant get enough of this CD. all the songs are STR8. this CD is a musy buy. It's been five years since this album was released, and I STILL listen to it almost every day. This is what makes him the true KING OF R &amp; B. He shows his real talent in this one. He plays ALL the instruments himself. He  doesn't try to make sounds just by pressing some buttons on the computer,  which is almost dominating the R &amp; B of today. Keep up the good work  (which he did with &quot;R.&quot;).The lyrics have an ability to stay  in your mind. I know all the lyrics and ad-libs. And that doesn't mean that  they're simple. They're original. His unique style of saying things is just  fantastic. Take for instance: &quot;You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride  it. Something like my sound, I wanna pump it. Girl you look just like my  cars, I wanna wax it. And something like my bank account, I wanna spend  it.&quot;R. Kelly sings about the biggest and best emotion of all: LOVE.  The songs concern seduction, not wasting time if it isn't true love, what a  woman means, secrecy, his love dying, he looks into his life and  more.This is a masterpiece from the biggest and most brilliant  soulartist of the 90's. You just put it on and let it play. Now his is pure  soul that makes you listen to over and over again. Anyone that likes soul  or R &amp; B will like this, simply timeless. If you don't have it, then  why are you still reading this. BUY IT. This is the album that really made me take notice of ""Tha Rrah""! I gave it a 5 star rating because as a music lover, any album that grabs my attention & allows me to listen all the way through without skipping is classic in my book.  This album just flows from song to song, no production flaws, no songs that jarred my sensabilities.There's not a bad song on this disc but the standouts to me are:You Remind Me of Something - classic slow jam for the 90's(You To Be Happy) w/ Notorious B.I.G. - great collaboDown Low - who can forget that epic videoI Can't Sleep Baby - love this song!Trade in My Life - as powerful as ""I Believe I Can Fly"" I Thought I'd Never Be A R.

Although the begging stuff gets kinda worn out, only he could do it in so many ways!!!  And &quot;Trade in My Life&quot; is one of the best gospel songs I've ever  heard!!!  Keep it up!!! I LOVE R.KELLY!!! HE IS THE BEST R&B; ARTIST WITHOUT A DOUBT!!!IF YOU DON'T KNOW, NOW U KNOW! GET THIS ALBUM IT'S OFF THE HOOK, EVERY ALBUM HE'S PUT OUT, DESERVES 5 STARS. HE IS A TRULY TALENTED MAN, HIS VOICE IS OFF THE HOOK. I got hooked on this CD as a kid. My father use to play this CD all the time (like every day) thoughout the house we lived in. My favorite song to this day is I CANT SLEEP BABY. I know i am young but i have to admit, the songs that come out to this day cannot compare to the songs that this album and other great albums that have been written and inspire people to love care caress and enjoy eachother. not the stupid songs that people my age consider HIT SONGS (that criticize genders) this will always be my favorite song as well as Aaliyah (the one i gave my heart to. which is a different artist with another CD) i will alway keep this cd in my collection i like these cd that  he  has in amazon  we really like his singingand you can to like him I have to give not just 5, but 10 stars for this masterpiece! I had listened to this album from start to finish without ever skipping a track. I have NO regrets whatsoever! Every song is great in it's own way, and I like the way in which the album blends. It's mature, it's original, it's romantic, it's emotional, there're lots of melody going on, it's smooth R&B...easy-listening.; And it's great for relaxing to. :)The album is very well arranged and thought out, not rushed. Personally, I'd recommend it over a few of his other albums: 12 Play, TP.2, Chocolate Factory, and that dreaded Happy People/U Saved Me. On this album R.Kelly proves his power of write, arrange and perfom better than ever.its that in this one contains more romantic R&B; songs and less hip-hop. He also uses almost all the Instruments in this one. My favorites tracks are: HUMP BOUNCE(SMOOTH PARTY UP SONG), NOT GONNA HOLD (ABOUT RELANTIONSHIP),YOU REMIND ME OF SOMETHING(RELAXING,SEXUAL AND HOT), STEP IN MYROOM(GREAT SWEET BALLAD),DOWN LOW(GREAT SLOW JAM duet with RONALD ISLEY),I CANT SLEEP BABY(THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TRACK ON THE ALBUM),THANK GOD IS FRIDAY (DANCE CLUB MUSIC)AND RELIGIOUS LOVE (VERY SPIRITUAL LOVING SONG). For me this ONE of his  best albums. R.Kelly has proved this work and his next two, that he getting BETTER AND BETTER.GREAT JOB KELLY,KEEP YOUR HEAD UP NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS!. WELL I HOPE EVERYONE WILL ENJOY THIS CD A LOT. SO GO AND BUY IT NOW. This is at first, the First R.Kelly Album that caught me the attention at first since I Work in a Wal-Mart Store in Puerto Rico, where I live. Because this was the only R.Kelly Album that the Store had at the time I was working OVERNIGHT there. When I bought it and hear it I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS MUSIC. It was so Relaxing, so Smooth, Spiritual, Sensual and Soulful that the few time I have for myself awake at day I heard it all the way (IT STILL ROCKING MY CD PLAYER). All the Songs are Amazing. Then I bought THE MASTERPIECE TP-2.COM which was release the same week I bought it. WOOOOOWWWWWW. IT WAS AND STILL IS THE BEST ALBUM I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE VERY CLOSELY TO THIS ONE. I mean All of the R.Kelly Albums are Amazing Classics...BUT THIS TWO ARE HIS GREATEST TIL THIS DATE IN MY OPINION. This is the Best R&amp;B you can listen to it. By the Best Musician, Performer, Singer, Songwritter, Producer, Arranger and Remixer in the last 15 to 18 Years...R.Kelly...THE BEST... You could think that this was his first album based on the eponymous title of it, but it was his third album after ""Born Into the 90's"" from 1992 together with Public Announcement, althought it sounded like a R. Kelly affair all the way, and then the sexual explicit ""12 Play"" from 1993. This album was released in 1995 and stands as one of his best albums to date, only ""12 Play"" and ""R"" can measure with it. This is a quite easily accessible album since it doesn't follow any trend or theme, no overwhelming sexual lyrics nor a overpretentious Step album either. It got a great mix of the best, some faster songs but many wonderful tearjerking ballads aswell, infact some of the greatest R. Kelly songs are actually found here. There isn't much filler either nor any annoying hip hop collaborations like we saw on latter albums, no, ""R Kelly"" stands strong on it's own and as a whole this is a fantastic story of trade mark R. Kelly songs that fans would drool over.The album starts with ""Hump Bounce"" that actually, based on it's name sound like it would have been on ""12 play"", it's a sexy midtempo with lyrics both from a woman and a rapper. A very good song. ""Not Gonna Hold You"" is a semi-ballad that also feautures female vocals, ""You Reminds Me Of Something"" stands as one of his best ballads to date, songs like this made R. Kelly one of the most promising songwriters of the 90's. ""Step Into My Room"", yet another laidback sexy ballad. Perhaps also better for his previous album?. ""Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby"" yet another laidback soulish ballad. ""(You To Be) Happy"" is midtempo soul.""Down Low"" is one of my favorite R. Kelly songs, it's a very poignant ballad feauturing Ron and Ernie Isley, the great video also which portraited R. Kelly in the middle of a fatal jelousy drama. ""I Can't Sleep"" follows the trend of slow jamz while ""Thank God It's Friday"" is a excellent club song, even if it's slick. ""Love Is One the Way"" is yet another good midtempo, ""Heaven"" is only a interlude but ""Religious Love"" shows some of his more faithful sides. ""Tempo Slow"" is one of the slower songs of this album, it's dreamy and meditative. Next song called ""As I Look Into My Life"" is also more of a interlude but ""Trade My Love"" closes this album well, another midtempo that is.""R.Kelly"" is one of his best albums, needless to say it captures you with it's mix of slick and sexy ballads and midtempo's and it doesn't contain much filler either. If You're new to R. Kelly start with this one or ""12 Play"". This album is more clean though. 5/5 Oh this is the first album from R.Kelly that I have bought about 5 or 6 years ago and still I`m enjoyed like it`s still brand new. This is at first, one of the best albums I have listen to it (in addition with with his 2000 Classic ""TP-2.Com"" Album, THE BEST R&B ALBUM EVER MADE and his recent Classic ""Chocolate Factory"" Album).Every single song is amazing and beautiful. Its the type of album can make you very relax and for the moment made your problems dissapear. I love the way how Kellz managed to been singing about love making and about religious love for god and for life. My personal favorites here are: ""Hump Bounce"", ""Not Gonna Hold"", ""You Remind Me Of Something"", ""Step In My Room"", ""Down Low(Nobody Has To Know)"", ""I Can`t Sleep Baby(If I)"", ""Thank God Its Friday"", ""Religious Love"" and The Beautiful Gospel ""Trade In My Life"". In my opinion this is R.Kelly`s Second Best Album tied with ""Chocolate Factory"" and behind His Best Album ""TP-2.Com"". But I tell you to get this know even if you don`t like r&b you will loving it. R Kelly found God. What a wonderful feeling! Listen closely to the lyrics and look at the different song titles. His mom is up in heaven, smiling down on him. This cd was one of my favorites back in the day, &amp; i played it so much everyone in my house knew the words!!Seriously this album is one of the best Kel has ever placed on this earth, i mean i love everything about it from first to last. My top songs are: &quot;tempo slow&quot;,&quot;you remind me&quot;,&quot;trade in my life&quot;, &quot;thank god its friday&quot;,&quot;down low&quot;,&quot;not gonna hold on&quot;, &amp; the list wouldn't stop.Every song is just so smooth &amp; Kel just makes me feel good to be from Chicago.On these tracks he takes love making to a whole new level, so what song should you play 2 set the mood?&quot;Tempo slow&quot; is the best 2 me. I don't care what nobody says, we gone hold Kel down til' the end, ain't no stoppin' the Pied Piper!! This is when Robert Kelly became R. Kelly, the start of his great music and talent. With the hit tracks such as &quot;You Remind Me of Something&quot;, &quot;Down Low (Nobody Has to Know)&quot; [the prequel to &quot;Contagious&quot; by Ron Isley], I Can't Sleep Baby (If I) and more. If you liked any of R. Kelly's new albums then you'll like R. Kelly ~ R. Kelly. This was R. Kelly's second album and you can tell he was in the zone on this album. he was starting to come into his own music. Great album, great artist. This CD shows R. Kelly the artist.  I believe this displays the complex person that he appears to be.  His party side, his sexual side, his loving side, and his spiritual side.  My favorite songs are ""trade in my life"", ""love is on the way"", ""baby, baby, baby, baby, baby"", and "" I can't sleep"".  I think this is most personal album.  He seems to be stripping away layers through each song. With this item, it was the same scenario........ This actually was a replacement of one I had already, but accidentally left in a rental vehicle & didn't realize it wasn't in my possession until 2 days after returning the vehicle.I found this to be a must replace because I use it for long travels when the radio looses its reception.I definitely like the fact that every track played perfectly as well!And shipping timing was great.If you're an R&B; listener, I'm sure anything that R. Kelly has written/produced that you've invested in; you weren't disappointed. I listened to this CD and I was amazed. This CD starts off fast, then at the end it is slow and calm. The last song is an inspirational song which sounds soooo good. Pick up this album because it is worth it. I love R Kelly and all his material, and I love this album the best out of all I've heard of his.  I have almost all of his cd's but out of all of those, and in fact out of all I own, I still listen to this cd real often.  It's the best.  I love love love Down Low, Can't Sleep (Baby) and Thank God It's Friday - they are the best cuts on here.  He's such a great talent, and so underrated.  He's soulful and a joy to listen to.  Despite whatever goes on in his personal life, he remains one of my top favourite singers ever.  Down Low is among my top 10 favourite songs of all times and I could listen to this cd over and over again, never get sick of it. Who can make a CD better than Kells? This is an oldie but as with all of them its a goodie..... I think the song is hot.I like to listen to it whilei take a bubble bath. This cd is really good. As usual, R. Kelly is really talented writer and producer when it comes to music. No matter that this cd is ten years old, you can still listen to it over and over again. The best songs on here are ""you remind me of something"", ""step into my room"", ""baby, baby, baby, baby"", and ""down low"", which was a huge megahit when it came out and still is widely known for pinning the popular term to call any relationship that is the quiet, hush-hush, secretive sin of illicit sexual rompings (not that this is a good thing because it is really not, but the song sounds so good!) I do have to disagree with his message in ""the sermon"" where he throws the criticisms back in the faces of all those who condemn him for this sexual and explicit nature. All of that ""even the statue of liberty wants to bump and grind"" was uncalled for and unnecessary, and it is exactly this reason why he has gotten into so much trouble with his little scandals and sexual escapes. Though I like his music, people are right in their analysis of him because, really, he is just too sexual and wanton in nature for which he makes no apologies. What he calls ""judgment"" is really the truth. Thus, the conclusion: Despite its lax morals and looseness, its just a really nice and well-produced cd. This album in my opinion is R's finest of all. Sadly 1995's ""R. Kelly"" seems slept on (Due to a lack of real hit singles?), which is a damned shame as he never got as deep before or since. It is mature, beautifully orchestrated and he had now found his own vibe. ""Born Into The 90s"" and to a lesser extent ""12 Play"" were soaked with the influence of Guy's New Jack era material and although both (especially the later) had great chart friendly appeal, this album is his fully realised masterpiece.Operating within the framework of a gospel themed intro and closure, R. is on best behaviour and there is little of the shallow, thug posturings that on occasion have hurt his recent releases like ""R"" and ""TP-2.Com"". There is a chilled, bumping flow throughout and this is no better exemplified than on probably my favourite R. Kelly track of all, ""Down Low"". The chemistry between R and Ronald Isley (Brother Ernie assisting on guitar) is beautiful to behold. A true epic, laid back jam. ""Contagious"" the sequel (On Isley Brothers' ""Eternal"" album) is equally excellent.Other highlights to be found include ""You Remind Me Of Something"" with it's humourous metaphors and ""(You To Be) Be Happy"" which effortlessly works a Notorious BIG rap in. There's the usual quality bedroom ballad ""Step In My Room"", yet he ploughs a deeper grain with the exquisite ""I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)"". ""Hump Bounce"" and ""Thank God It's Friday"" are prime relaxed, head nodders.There's not a weak moment to be found and the LP's self titled moniker of ""R. Kelly"" surely comes from the work here being the ultimate personal statement of his artistic muse. Despite the relative inconsistency of subsequent efforts I'm sure he can sleep well, rest assured that in this album he produced a true work of class no matter what the future holds... This album is good to start to finnish. This is one of r. kelly best albums. If anyone not hip to the hip hop and R&B generation of the 90s, this album will take you on an unforgettable ride through a decade of smooth vocals over melodic tracks with rhythmic thumps. Nothing like the mysoginistic noise and drowning bass lines of today. Can't single out one track...this album is worthy of beginning to end play without skipping a single note. I truly dig this Album alot&more as time passes it just gets better with time.Between this Album,12play&Chocolatefactory/Loveland R.Kelly to me Has made 3 of the Most Important Albums since 1990.this Album Combines many elements that truly highlight R.Kelly as a Writer,Producer,arranger&His Vocals truly soar here.rocking it with Biggie on ""You to be Happy"" that Jam is my cut.""thank god it's friday"" is a Knockout Jam that truly gets me hyped on the weekends.""Dow Low nobody has to now"" with the Great Ronald Isley is a Hall of Fame Song that still is tight.""Religious Love"" works as well.this Soulful Genius is unstoppable when He allows His Musical Strengths to direct His Flow. oh this Album is so versatile&is almost a complete 180 turn around from 12 play.classic songs like:Religous Love,Trade in My Life,you remind me of my Jeep,I can't sleep,the Steppers Jam""Thank God it's friday"" the Great colab with Biggie on ""you to Be,Happy""(is the true Best of Both worlds) the start of the Great colab with the Isley's on ""DownLow"" was truly the start of the Best of Both Era's. the Isley brothers are the Greatest Band Ever.R.Kelly is the Greatest Solo Artist so it all worked out greatly.this Album has many moods&Feelings.a Classic. R. Kelly is a great artist, he has a voice of an angel some hate him, but if you listen to him sing all the hate will leave and you will see his talent. R. Kelly, yea. I remember hearing this cd at the age of 12. My older sister had the album and I loved it then, but heard it with different ears. Now, I am no longer in my youth, but I am in my 20's and this cd still is one of my favourites! This has to be up there with 12 Play, another one of R.Kelly's good album's. He is still one of the leading rnb singers around. His voice is magic on this album and the songs...you can definitely relate to! My friend, who doesn't listen to much rnb, bought this cd also. This is R. Kelly at his finest. Every song on this CD is good. The album has something for everyone on it. It has love ballads, funky beats, and even inspirational music (I especially love ""Trade in my life"") The music takes you on a feel-good journey. This album is a classic that you will never get tired of listening to. If you like grown-folk's music with a heart-felt message, this is the CD to own. I highly recommend it!!! R kelly began in that 90's generation era, which was my coming out so im kinda partial to the R ( present legal problems excluded ) he is an excellent song writer and producer, he has got that platinum touch no denying that. This Cd is one of his best. Like it may've already been stated in another review, ""This is probably one R. Kelly's more mature work,"" especially considering this is after12 Play, This is probably my favorite album by him, because as a  whole, it's a real good album, not just a few major singles, then the rest my be just mediocre, I'll admit there were some that I wasn't really fawned of, but there were more pluses, than minuses. As many of us already know, probably the most popular song off of hear, and most played video,Down Low (Nobody Has to Know)but there were other good songs...Here were some of the stand-out songs for me...starting off, you have, ""Hump Bounce,"" it's a pretty good party song, I remember it being used on an episode of ""Moesha,"" called, ""Sixteen,"" but in my opinion it's not one of the best songs. Moving to the next song you have, ""Not Gonna Hold On,"" I would have to say this is probably my favorite on here, ""a nice simple, laid back beat, with mature lyrics about a relationship that seems to be going nowhere. InYou Remind Me of Something, R. Kelly is trying to find a simile/metaphor best suited for his girl, with reminders of ""Cars,"" ""Bank,"" and ""Sound,"" the lyrics tend not to be classy, but I thought the song was good. Another one of my favorites, would have to be track 5, ""Step In My Room,"" this time around R. Kelly uses more range, the lyrics and the music just seem to go together so well. Another slower song is track 6, ""Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby,"" where he gives thanks to his woman for making him better, as far as lyrics, I think I like ""Not Gonna Hold On,"" better but I love the beat.  There were also so some other good ones like,I Can't Sleep Baby (If I),Down Low (Nobody Has to Know), ""Thank God, It's Friday,"" etc. And the only song with a featured artist is, ""(You To Be) Be Happy,"" which features the late Biggie Smalls, I just want to make this a right to the point review... So if your interested in mid 90's R&B;, *1995* to be exact, then I would say you should get, and if your fawned of R. Kelly's maturer music. Listening to R. Kelly, I realize that he has wonderful talent and his music can make you sing, dance and groove. I think he has the best beats and can entertain anyone of any age. You may love or hate even R. Kelly but you must realize that he has talent. Before the release of this album I thought the 12 Play was his best but this self-titled release blew that album out of the water. I love 12 Play and it would still gets spins till this day but this album got more spins from me than that album. This album came out at a time when R&B; gave you quality artists with tight albums so you couldnt go wrong with R Kelly back then. You could go wrong with him now because he's trying to hard to remain relevant by making songs for teenagers like that's all his fanbase consists of. At any rate....You Remind Me Of Something was the summer jam and I refuse to let some corny cable channel that nobody watches and some lame ragazine that is the b*st*rd child of Rolling Stone magazine tell me different. R Kelly is at his best when he does the slow jams like Step In My Room, Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby, Religious Love and the fantastic I Cant Sleep. I love Tempo Slow. It has a unique concept where the tempo of the song changes after every chorus(you would rarely find an artist that creative now and when one does come around stupid hoity-toity critics will knock them for being unconventional). The late Notorious Big makes his presence felt in (You To Be) Be Happy. Hump Bounce and Thank God Its Friday are dynamite party songs. Down Low feat The Isley Brothers is the beginning of the Mr Biggs/R Kelly saga. The album closes off with Trade In My Life. There are no bad songs to be found on here and that in itself is rare with 2000 R&B.;R Kelly's self-titled sophomore release is his best album point blank period. Its shows his range as an artist. It shows his talent at songwriting and it shows that he was a giant in the game that was here to stay. Pick it up if you are interested in what real R&B; is supposed to sound like.Standouts: YOU REMIND ME OF SOMETHING, STEP IN MY ROOM, BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY, DOWN LOW, I CAN'T SLEEP BABY, RELIGIOUS LOVE, TEMPO SLOW and TRADE IN MY LIFE. It's rare that an artist releases a record with no title. As if to say, &quot;Here I am, baby, this record is so good it doesn't even NEED a title.&quot; Now, in R. Kelly's case, I would say that's a little overestimation, but this is still a very good record.My main issue with R. Kelly is that he can't decide what he wants to be: his songs exude vibes of a sex maniac, a star-crossed lover, even a seriously religious devotee. And it's that multiple-persona problem that makes his albums sound like a compilation more than an actual work. But be that as it may, the collection of songs on this album is more than ample.Kicking off with a Baptist-style sermon, we segue right into the complete opposite end of the spectrum with &quot;Hump Bounce,&quot; the world's Fifteen-Millionth song to sample &quot;The Big Payback.&quot; However, R. rides the track to R&amp;B/hip-hop perfection. &quot;R. Kelly&quot; is laced throughout with a distinctively more urban/hip-hop feel than his debut, &quot;12 Play,&quot; and it works to his advantage much more so than on slightly clunky numbers like &quot;12&quot;'s &quot;Back to the Hood of Things.&quot; The best example of this from the new record is &quot;You to Be (Be Happy),&quot; where R. pairs with the late Notorious B.I.G. who kicks a memorable verse indeed over a bouncy bass-laden track.There are, of course, the syrupy-sweet ballads like &quot;Step In My Room&quot; and &quot;Love is On the Way,&quot; as well as the more R-rated songs like &quot;You Remind Me of Something,&quot; where R. croons &quot;You remind me of my Jeep/I wanna ride it/Something like my bank account/I wanna spend it.&quot; Words fail me.All in all, this album works very well, and is a good addition to your R&amp;B collection. R. Kelly's 1995 self titled album is a classic R&B album. It's an album that all music fans must have. R.kelly is the best R&B artist ever. he released of 7 albums, each one I would give a 5 star rating, and who ever wouldn't, is crazy. But this is his album I would consider his best album. It has 16 of his greatest tracks ever, including his classic hit ""Down Low"" and other great songs like ""Thank God It's Friday"" and ""Hump Bounce"" Cop this album, you can't have a music collection without it. I do not know how one can rate this any lower that 5 stars.  It is an amizingly solid work by an incredibly talented guy.  Send this to some sweetie and watch it turn her on before your eyes.  You will get hooked on this. ordered the R Kelly cd it was affordable and it is good quality and alsoit was nice to sit back and enjoy the old R Kelly One of my favorite albums by R.  This is when we had to realize, ""this brother is talented!!!!""  This album was good because he had some of his love songs on it, then the songs to make you groove, and threw in some spirtual songs to round it off.  There is something for everyone on this CD.My favorite cuts on this CD:2. Hump Bounce - nice litte groove6. Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby7. You to be Happy8. Down Low - the relationship between he and Isley was born9. I can't sleep baby14.Temp Slow16. Trade in My life - he was testifying on this song!!!The whole album is good, but the songs I listed are the songs I play the most. I have been listening to R. Kelly since he first came out with &#34;Honey love&#34;. I think I have all of his cds, maybe missing the latest. He is a genius when it comes to music. 12 Play was the first. Actually, this joint is a lot more musical and thematically well rounded than it's predecessor.Classic Joints:Hump BounceNot Gonna Hold OnYou Remind Me Of SomethingStep In My RoomBaby, Baby, Baby, Baby(You To Be) Be HappyDown Low (Nobody Has To Know)I Can't Sleep Baby (If I)Thank God It's FridayLove Is On The WayTempo SlowAs I Look Into My LifeTrade In My Life After releasing his best album of his career 12 Play..  R.Kelly drop  another  incredible effort in 95.. This CD was kind of a departure from  the sexual overtones of 12 Play.. The material here concentrated more on  love and romance and spirtually.. However there are a couple of tracks here  that finds Mr. Kelly going back to the formula that work for him on 12 Play  on such tracks as  You Remind Me Of Something and  Tempo Slow these two  songs could have easily been on  12 Play.. The best moments on this CD  is  when  it concentrates  on love that evident on such tracks  Religious Love,  If I , Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby these songs Mr. Kelly sings with such  heart  and conviction..  Other note worthy selections  Be Happy( You To Be),  Step  In To My Room, Thank God It's Friday,  a great effort from one the best in  r&amp;b today..  If you missed out on this the first time.. Do yourself a  favor  pick it  up..  You dont know what you're missing R. Kelly has Been getting into a lot of BS and making stupit decisions that's been hurting his carrer, which is the R. Kelly people talk about today. During the release of this album, which was in 1995 he wasn't in much trouble with the law, but forget about his personal life, you can't doubt the kind of talent this man has, Im talking singing, producing, and writing your own music which is amazing.This is R. Kelly's 3rd studio album and his best till that date, thats right you thought 12 play was a classic just wait till you hear this album. ""R. Kelly"" is more mature than his preivous works, this album is emotional, religious and romantic.Let's do a little review on the songs. R. Kelly starts off the album unexpectedley with a Sermon, he preaches emotionaly for over 3 minutes. The album begins fast with a couple smooth jams, ""Hump Bounce"" and ""Not Gonna Hold On"". ""You Remind Me Of Something"" is probally the most ranchy song on the album and one of his best. The album starts to slow down a little with two romantic ballads, ""Step Into My Room"" and ""Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby"". The guest apperances on the album comes, ""(You To Be) Happy"" featuring Notorious BIG and R. Kelly's collabo with Ronald Isley ""Down Low (Nobody Has To Know)"" which is the best song on the album in my opinion. ""Cant Sleep Baby (If I)"" is really emotional, some think its R. Kelly best song ever written. ""Thanks God It's Friday"" is a really smooth steping club jam, similar to ""Step In The Name Of Love"" of ""Chocolate Factory"". ""Love Is On The Way"" is another tight club banger. This is were the album really starts to slow down a little bit religiously and romanticly. Followed by the skit ""Heaven If You Hear Me"", ""Religious Love"" mixes romantic love and gospel together, I love the chorus I cant stop singing it. ""Tempo Slow"" is VERY, VERY, VERY slow, these are the type of love makeing lyrics that make lots things go down in a bedroom, in addition its my best balled in the album. Followed by the emotional skit ""As I Look Into My Life"", R. Kelly finished off the album with the powerful gospel ""Trade In My Life"" similar to ""I Believe I Can Fly"" of ""R."", both are hands down the best gospels he ever written.Overall this is a classic in any means, and I think anybody would agree with me who owns this album its one of his best. I would recommend this album over ""TP-2.com"" which is his true masterpiece in my opinion and ""Chocolate Factory"" which is his best romanticly. When I first bought this CD I didnt think it was going to be great at all. After hearing it again you can understand how he is and how he grew up. Of course the stand out track is Down Low but my favorite track is ""Thank God is Friday"" Buy this CD is shouldnt be that expensive and its worth it!","R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Soul,Pop,Contemporary R&B",one best good leave start finish get bored establishing strong solo presense playthis really distance r kelly semblance new jack swing remained earlier recordings much mary jsmy lifethis part series recordings swing genre hip hop r b fluid groove showcases mixture modern touches live instruments sermon intro r kelly really began involve age old soul tradition blending spiritual secular consistantly pulling al green style lyric tag throughout drop hat pleading jesus pleading romance time era comes something surprise often enough two concepts seemed play seperately together overall theres strong similarity one best good leave start finish bored establishing strong solo really distance r kelly semblance new new jack swing jack swing remained earlier recordings series recordings swing genre hip hip hop hop fluid groove showcases mixture modern touches live live instruments instruments intro r kelly really began involve age old old soul soul tradition blending spiritual secular pulling al al green green style lyric tag drop hat pleading jesus pleading romance time era comes surprise concepts seemed play overall strong similarity
214,434,B00000053E,"What can I say other than WOW!  Every song is great. You can listen to it from biginning to end I can't pick a favorit because I love them all so much!  LOVE SONG FOR A SAVYOR, HE and WORLDS APART are beautiful BOY ON  A STRING, LIQUID and LIKE A CHILD are all realy great up beat songs but  aren't just noise like some songs. You've got to get CD it's worth ten  times what it costes! I first got in touch with Jars of Clay by downloading &quot;Love Song For A Savior&quot; on a whim and promptly bought the album very soon after that. My reasoning for what was - comparatively - an example of impulse buying was that if what I'd heard was true about the rest of the album being more of the same then it would have to be worth the money. I was quite right.This album is one of the better examples, not just of Christian rock, but of rock in general of the late 20th-early 21st centuries. The pop hooks which take up residence in your memory and don't go away are still there, so are the glorious vocal harmonies, but even without bringing a Christian perspective to the listening experience, the listener can see that there's certainly something more here than there is on the charts.Despite being a Christian myself, I'm not a big fan of over-preachiness in Christian music - beyond the praise/worship style. Thus, it is a considerable advantage that, with the exception of &quot;Love Song For A Savior&quot; and &quot;Art In Me&quot;, the Christian references can really only be picked up if you know what you're listening for. Certainly tracks like &quot;Liquid&quot; and &quot;Flood&quot; seem to be talking about some kind of faith, but then again, the secular listener could easily think of them as rehashing the sorts of themes that most modern rock acts visit once or twice every album.The music and lyrics here are superb, there's simply no other word for them. I maintain my belief that the majority of the album sounds like the restrained parts of Creed's songs, but that's not one which has much agreement among other people who've heard both acts. Creed-like or not, Jars Of Clay have taken the acoustic sound and shining harmonies of the best folk-rock and adapted them to the modern rock sound. There are some moments - especially on &quot;Flood&quot; and &quot;Liquid&quot; - where a little more bombast may have helped the song forward a bit, but that could so easily have diluted the message of these songs. Other reviewers have mentioned the Gregorian chant sample in &quot;Liquid&quot;, and that in itself is worth the price of admission, in the right setting, the effect is literally spine-tingling.Jars are also not afraid to experiment with their sound, adding in strings where needed and even samples of children's voices to create a multi-layered work.While the songs on the album are richly deserving of a 5-star rating, one star has to be removed for the &quot;hidden track&quot; at the end of &quot;Blind&quot;. This track is simply a collection of snippets of the orchestra used in some songs tuning up and some half-obscured voices talking about exactly how different parts should sound. While the album would certainly not be very long without it, the time could easily have been made up by taking the time to record some extra songs rather than recording these &quot;outtakes&quot;.All in all, a very worthwhile purchase indeed. From a Christian perspective it's great to hear these young men who clearly have a mission and aren't afraid to share it, and the non-Christians who will hear it will be pleasantly surprised that the word &quot;Jesus&quot; is barely ever mentioned. Out of the three Jars of Clay CDs (Jars of Clay, Much Afraid, and If I left the zoo) this would definately be the one I would recommend most.  Although I love each one for their own sound, listening to this CD (for me) definately gives me a feeling a nostalgia.  Songs such as Liquid, Love Song for a Savior, Like a Child, and Flood, are probably the most well known, and some of my favorites. Dan Haseltine has a beautiful voice, even more beautiful live, and he is also an amazingly talented writer, considering he wrote all the lyrics on this CD.  I would  recommend this to anyone who loves CCM music, and even those who do not.  I own tons of CCM cds, and out of all of them, I definately play this one the most.  The 11th track that someone else mentioned is on the 6th minutes of the 10th track.  It is a song based on 2 Cor. 4:7, where JOC got their name. This is one of Christian music's best!Liquid - The song starts out with like a chant and that sounds really cool. It talks about Jesus's blood, and his death - very powerful.Sinking - This one really gets to me for some reason. It's about how we don't think we need God.Love Song for a Savior - ""I want to fall in love with you"" Falling in love with JesusLike a Child - We need to have the faith of a child to get into heavenArt in me - ""see the art in me"" Talks about how beautiful we really areBoy on a String - We need to break away from being puppetsFlood - We all know this one...Worlds Apart - A very powerful song that I have a very hard time trying to explain.Blind - Being blind to everything around us, and not trusting God, etc.One more thing - buy this! This is the best band in Christian music and this is perhaps their best performance.  The acoustics are awesome.  The lyrics are absolutely unbeatable, intelligent, thought-provoking and uncompromisingly Christ-centered.  You will not be disappointment. Even though I am not of the religious sort, I bought this album many years ago when it first came out and didn't mind the fact that many of the songs dealt with or got their inspiration from, god as it is in the christain religion, because the lyrics and musical arrangements come through quite clearly.No matter what your faith, it's very evident when listening the passion that went into making this record, which makes it one of the only christain-based albums I actually like. Many of the songs even have a bit of open interpretation, like on the song ""Art In Me""; I always saw a struggling French painter with little or no money who only wanted to paint and show it to the world.Of all their records since, this one still stands out as their best achievement and is well worth a listen. This is by far one of my most favorite CD's. I can't tell you how many times I have listened to it. It's in my top 10 best CD's of all time. This album is passionate, full of love, emotion, and controversy. It is totally poetic and has soul! This is their debut, and unlike some bands (yet, oddly like others) JOC made thier best album when they made this one! I had thought they'd continue to evolve and become better still, and they are still young so they might yet,but this album showcases so much talent. The raw and fresh &quot;Flood&quot; hyponotized me and I had to buy this album, though I usually don't do that having only heard ONE song! This album is one that is pleasant from start to finish and &quot;Blindness&quot; is a beautiful ballad parallelling the story of doubting Thomas. &quot;he&quot; brings tears to my eyes and &quot;Boy on a string&quot; is the perfect anthem for youth and manipulation, &quot;Liquid&quot; combines mystic chants with a raw and clear statement of Christ's importance and His memory. &quot;Like a Child&quot; is so soulful and innocent and &quot;Art in Me&quot; is just the perfect accoustic number! This album is beautifully crafted, produced, and the lyrics will warm your soul. A perfect ten! Ok, I heard Flood recently(I know this has been out for like ten years now). Real cool song, but that's all. This album really sucks. It's really mellow and almost boy-bandish. The drum machine the band utilizes is laughable. This is a horrible record. Thats all I don't know what I was talking about before.  This album is quite good, I still prefer &quot;Much Afraid&quot; &amp; &quot;If I Left The Zoo,&quot; but notwithstanding... pretty darn good.  In addition to the songs I listed  below in the last review, highlights are &quot;Sinking,&quot; &quot;Love  Song For A Savior,&quot; &amp; &quot;Boy On A String.&quot;  It grew on me,  although it sounds more country than edgy. This is an awesome Cd. This is the best Cd that Jars of clay has come out with! I never get tired of it. =0) i used to own this on tape many moons ago. and of course the tape eventually wore out. i finally got around to buying it on cd and still love it just as much today. this was my first introduction to anything other than contemporary christian music and i fell in love with it. i love to worship to this cd. Jars of Clay's album cleverly titled ""Jars of Clay"" will either send you off your chair in excitement or make you shed tears of joy because of its brilliance and the special message that each song carries. The way the album is set up is equally important as the content of the songs, it flows in such a way that you could listen to the whole thing with out skipping a song. It starts out full of energy with such songs as ""Liquid"" and ""Sinking"" and then after that it goes to a beautiful, melodic anthem, ""Love Song for a Savior"" that will almost make you shed a tear. The next five songs, including the hit song ""Flood"" are packed with great melodies and high energy. The album then closes out with two of their slower songs which round out the album very well. The blend of acoustic guitars and stringed instruments on this album was produced extraordinarily well and really has no dull or dry moments. This is the best CD ever made! The songs are the best and Jars of Clay is the best Christian group ever. The songs definitely touched me and I recommend buying it. It would stir up a great deal of debate among music lovers everywhere, but there probably is no greater debut album of the 1990's then Jars of Clay.  As popular music was making a transition from &quot;Alternative&quot; to something else in the mid-1990's, along comes a band in 1995 that completely blew everybody away with their acustic-based pop/rock.  Remember, 1995 was also the year that Third Day released its debut, DC Talk demonstrated a new sound in &quot;Jesus Freak,&quot; and stalwart veterans such as Whiteheart and Petra were also trying something different.  Yet, it was Jars of Clay that became the &quot;talk of the town&quot; during 1995 and 1996, and they sold millions of CD's in the process.The single greatest reason Jars of Clay gained such notoriety so quickly has to be credited to their fresh approach to song writing and production.  As you read along with the lyrics, poetry plays such an important part in each song.  The themes are moving both spiritually and emotionally as Jars of Clay create vivid word pictures.  Artistry plays such monumental part in this CD as demonstrated by the marriage of strong lyrics with innovative instrumentation.  Accustic guitars are mixed with  electronics and other studio effects, and it works!  You will also hear an accompaniment of strings in a couple of songs too.  Add that with Dan Haseltine's delicate yet pervasive tenor lead vocals and you have a unique experience known as Jars of Clay.While the music industry and its media partners rejoice over album sales and hit song charts, Jars of Clay should not be purchased simply because it was a huge sales item several years ago.  Play through the CD first, and then see how you relate to your Savior God afterwards.  While you can characterize none of the songs as praise and worship, you would have to admit that Christ-centered lyrics and themes abound from start to finish.  The imagery is beautiful indeed. I can not say enough about this album from Jars of Clay! When this album was first out a friend of mine gave it to me in the hopes that it would strengthen my faith.... And did it ever!!!! These guys have a special and unique sound and the words are both biblical and poetic..Since having heard this CD, I have bought but then have given it away two or three different times in the hopes it would be as spiritually uplifting to others as it has been for me! You will not be disappointed (promise) if you buy it. God Bless you! I have all three of the Jars of Clay CDs. My favorite is still the 1st release Jars of Clay. I have been a musician for over 20 years and a radio announcer for 5. I have a love for every type of music I hear. Jars of Clay &lt;album> was a blessing and still is. I haven't heard anything as deeply moving lyrically since Rich Mullens who I considered the Psalmist of our Century. Jars of Clay (group) is talented and inspirational with a true love for God and for the ministry He has given them. If you are looking for the way Christian music should move then start with this CD. If you attend &quot;The Passion of Christ&quot; be sure on the way home to have this superior Cd in the car and play &quot;Liquid&quot; and see if the hair on your arms stand on end or you get goosebumps!  To the folks who may think Jars are mellow, listen to &quot;Flood&quot;, I beg to differ. Besides being a wonderful CD witha great Christian message, the music is soothing and absolutley beautiful.  I listen to it ALL the time, and I still haven't grown tired of listening to the songs such as Love Song for a  Savior, Like a Child, Flood, and Blind.  I would suggest this song for  anyone. Period. This is Jars of Clay's first major release and is sadly their most popular album.  I am a huge Jars of Clay fan, and a proud owner of one the 1,500 copies of their Demo CD &quot;Frail&quot;.  Although their most popular song &quot;Liquid&quot; is outstanding, I believe the best, or at least most moving song, on the album is &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;.  If you want a really powerful version of this song join their fan club and get their &quot;StringTown&quot; CD, which is only available to fan club members.  If you liked this CD you should look into their newer albums, &quot;Much Afraid&quot; and &quot;If I left the Zoo&quot;.  They are different, but I believe the band has truly evolved into something awesome and very original.  Regardless, if you don't own this album, it should be your first Jars of Clay purchase, and I know you will enjoy it. I think that jars of clay is one of the greatest alternative christian bands ever.  I believe that they put a lot of time and effort into their lyrics to make them special to reach people that know God or would like to  know God.  I saw them in concert once in oklahoma city and the spirit they  sent into the crowd was amazing.  I recommend this to any listener who  wants a cd with a variety of tunes...slow meditation, to upbeat praise...I  think it is best when you read the lrics when u listen to the cd for the  first time, and you completely feel like they are talking to you....so if  you ever wanted to open your heart to God more....this makes you want to  more than that...i hope that in the future more teens listen to their music  and get a feeling of peace that we so long for today..I am 21yrs old and  this is great music with great style and lyrics..thanks for listening I was introduced to Jars of Clay with ""The Eleventh Hour"" album, which I truly enjoy. I bought this album based on the high review ratings, but I found the music to be mediocre--I just don't enjoy the melodies on this album. There are only two that I consider to be OK.  A much better album:The Eleventh Hour Okay, I am definately not a Christian music fanatic. Usually I stick with rock, grunge, and alternative bands- but this CD really amazed me! I didn't realise how good Christian music could be. I thought it was just a bunch of  gospal music and church hymns. When I got Jars of Clay's CD, it was not on  purpose. I took it from my mom, and thought it was one of my CDs, and  suprisingly enough ended up KEEPING it! After getting pulled into Jars of  Clay's music, some of my more Christian friends introduced me to more  AWESOME music like Newsboys and DC Talk. Even if you're not one for  Christian, try Jars of Clay, you'll probably be suprised! The year was 1996. I was 12 and a half years old, and for Christmas I received my first radio. It was stationary, had a tape deck, worked as an alarm clock, and most importantly, it had a CD player. I'd never owned my own music before, so my parents also purchased two CDs for me. The first was from the Irish rock band, The Cranberries. The album was To the Faithful Departed. Great album... that's not what this is about, though. The second disc literally (and I'm not saying literally in that annoying what that actually means figuratively) served as a guiding point for my life. The album was Jars of Clay's first studio album Jars of Clay. It's hard for me to say just how much this album means to mean. Although only 10 tracks long, the profundity and timelessness of the tracks have spoken to me at nearly every stage of my life since. I'll be completely honest and say that there is no way I can objectively review this album as it is subject an an endless number of memories and the nostalgia of fourteen years. Consider yourself warned.Originally released in 1995 on the Essential/Silvertone label, Jars of Clay was a landmark release in the Christian music industry. Labeled a ""crossover"" album, it saw success on both Christian and Mainstream radio. It isn't a stretch to say that by the time I owned this album, 90% of America had heard the single ""Flood"".What set Jars of Clay apart from most CCM music of it's time was the honesty of the lyrics and what has (far too often) been described as their ""jangle-pop"" sound. Laced with well arranged string accompaniment, driving acoustic guitar, drum loops, and wonderful vocal harmonies the band's debut album gave them a position of respect from a wide range of artist, and allowed them rare opportunities, like opening for Sting.Because of my lack of objectivity, I have trouble pointing out highlights, but I'll attempt to narrow it down. The obvious choices are ""Love Song for a Savior"", ""Flood"", and ""Worlds Apart"". These songs have received so much attention of the years, and they are examples of top notch musicianship and lyrical content. However, my personal favorite is one that has, in recent years, seen less attention than I would personally like. The song is ""He"". It deals with domestic violence from the perspective of a child. The song is heartbreaking in it's subject matter.""Daddy, don't you love me? Why do you hit me?Momma, don't you love me? Then why do you hurt me?I try to make you proud, but for crying out loud.Just give me a chance to hide away.""""A tear drop falls from up in the heavens,Drowning the sorrows of angels on high.For the least of the helpless, the hopeless the loveless,Your Jesus, His Children, He holds in his eyes.""Sigh... as a father it brings me to tears.This is an album I have recommended more times than I can count. Consider this review my recommendation to you. You don't have to be a person of faith to enjoy it. It's beautiful. It celebrates the mystery of emotion, and mourns the desperation of sorrow.Needless to say, five out of five stars. Jars of Clay (this album anyway) was incredibly innovative with this album.  It may sound very simple, yet, this is probably the most artistic Christian album ever.  Plus, I love how the band is not ashamed to admit their brokenness (I believe anyone who calls themself a christian and doesn't admit to being broken is a liar.  Disagree?  I'd love to discuss.  ...).  Anyway, I believe this album is amazing in its deceptive simplicity.  A must for anyone who's tired of hearing the feelings-only-please-check-your-brains-at-the-door Christian music that is popular today. I know this might sound trite, but this is the best cd ever!  With the intense musical talent, inspirational lyrics, and original melodies this cd has become my favorite. I especially love the song LOVE SONG FOR A SAVIOR.  The sweetly haunting words of this song are amazing! Dan Hasletine's  awesome voice also enhances this startling wonderful first cd. This band  truly follows the philosophy of their name-influenced verse: We have this  treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from God  and not from us. -2 Corinthians 4:7 I can not count the number of times I have been listening to this cd and feel as if God is whispering some message into my ear through these beautiful lyrics. This cd is truly God-breathed, and I never can stop  wondering with awe that these songs were written by 19 and 20 year olds!  These songs are unbelievable in their content, with the amazing voice of  Dan Hasletine singing these lyricaly simplistic songs, but deeply moving  with their subtle messages, all with imaginative and unique melodies (I  absolutely love the Gregorian chant in Liquid, and the string solo in  Flood!) Jars of Clay will never cease to amaze me with their philisophical  approach to human frailties, perspective of religion as a precious  relationhip with God, and of course their awesome music! Their creative  appraoch to using strings, and Dan's wonderful, wonderful voice have  certainly made me find a treasure in Jars of Clay. I've loved this album ever since it came out. The music is timeless and so is the message. Highly recommended! Definately the best Jars of Clay cd. All the songs are good. i lost my copy so i am replacing it, it's that good! don't hesitate. :) This simply is a great album.  This was my first purchase of a Christian album back in 1997.  Since then I have not been much of a Jars of Clay fan, becasue they have changed quite a lot from this debut album.  BUT that doesn't mean that this album is not the best good wholehearted effort that I have seen in Christian music in many many years.I personally perfer much much harder genres of Christian music (Demon Hunter, Project 86, Chevelle, Pillar, etc.) but I cant say enough how I just love this album (BUT who cant love the early DC Talk, Newsboys stuff!!!!).  From the intro to the ending you will not be dissapointed.  Even though every song is not a blockbuster, it is still a very worthy purchase.This album is mostly synth pop, but trust me its very good.  If you want to start your music collection in Christian music this is a great way to start.  If you have tons of Christian music and you don't have this one then order it, its a must have.This album is great for any age, with a profound clear meaning in each song.Song:1. Liquid - A great way to start the album out, gets you in the mindset for the rest (love those chants)2. Sinking - Not one of my favorites but very worthy3. Love Song For A Savior - Wow, what a great song, could be the best one4. Like A Child - Faith is Christ gets you far!5. Art in Me - Will take awhile to learn to like this one, not bad, good meaning yet not catchy like the rest, soft6. He - A song about abuse from a childs mind, great song, wonderful depth7. Boy on a String - Very popular song, not one of my favorites, yet good meaning8. Flood - Probably the best known song on the album, very different from the rest, more a rock9. Worlds Apart - You'll fall in love with this one, great meaning10. Blind - eh so so, BUT wait don't forget the hiden song six minutes in, you will recognize it from the Much Afraid albumClearly this CD is a must.  Any age can dive into this CD and love it for the message it brings.  Best of all its all for Christ! It was &quot;Flood&quot; that first got my attention a few years ago. The blend of violins with quick acoustic guitar strumming together with the lucid, smooth vocals of Hastletine was something that set it apart from the stale mainstream music that we were habituated to.Each song in this album is a gem in its own little way. &quot;Liquid&quot; sets the tone with a Gregorian chant cleverly pasted in, and a catchy tune with a lively beat. &quot;Like a Child&quot; is another track that has Jars Of Clay written all over it; well-textured music that will keep you interested right through. Listen to &quot;Art in Me&quot;; beautiful poetic lyrics with a perfect melody to go with. Violas and oboes accompanying guitars and percussion showcases the richness and meticulous thought that JOC put into this record. There's a catchy little segment on the 7th minute of &quot;Blind&quot;, so let that CD play right through.This is an album I cherish, I place it very high in my growing CD collection. I don't want to compare it to any other band because for me, they are incomparable. When they do make something, they make sure they do it right. It was ""Flood"" that first got my attention a few years ago.

I don't want to compare it to any other band because for me, they are incomparable. When they do make something, they make sure they do it right. you have to listen to this flawless peice of work.  there are very few cds or cassettes that you will enjoy every single song on the record, and this is one of them.  noone should miss this tape. I love this album ever since I was a kid face to listen to them not filing a little means it's even better well i like the cd and i like that song called worlds apart. When I first purchased this CD, it was for the then popular song LIQUID.  Its subtle lyrics are accompanied by a solid beat, but not overbearing like other Christian Rock music I've heard.  You know... the kind that quenches  the Spirit.  I must admit, my first reaction was that I would like about  two or three songs and the CD would eventually end up in the  &quot;pile&quot;.  NOT!  This is one of those collections that grows  better with time!  Each song tells of a different human condition of the  heart to which we can all can relate -  but you have to look deeper than  the surface.  This one is deep!  It's not your typical praise and worship  collection.  You probably can't sing the songs in Sunday worship.  But you  will sing them in your car!  You will sing them in praise to God!  It tells  of our relationship with a loving God in spite of our frailties.  Some  people will miss the soul searching, healing ministry Jars of Clay inspires  if they don't think.  Fortunately, the sound is soooo awsome that listening  to all the songs over and over is not a problem.  Two years after I first  heard this CD, it is still my #1 pick... period.  After several years of  feeling that I would &quot;sacrifice&quot; musical and poetic content for  the sake of wholesomeness (ie: CCM was sub-par), I am thrilled that CDs  like this prove CCM is now the crem-de-la-crem! This is Jars of Clay's best album that I've heard out of all of them (except 11th hour, which I haven't heard completely yet!). Everybody at one time or another can really feel all of these songs! This album, I believe, really explores all of the different phases and emotions that a person could go through in a matter of minutes while really having God's persepctive in the back of their minds the whole time. And yet, there are times when God is blatantly speaking directly to you. It seems as though their roots are really displayed in this album. BUY IT! The point is, regardless of whether it's Christian or not, good music is good music.  This is good music.  This is what all music should be:  original.  So what if they're Christians?  Look past that and see the art.  This band is talented, really talented.  Think of Toad The Wet Sprocket if they had reached their full potential, finding Jesus and throwing in drum machine.  This album's very good.  I say that in assured confidence because it really is undeniable.I rarely like any Christian music, but this album rises above that stereotype to a place where it is no longer judged by a standard of what makes good music, but it becomes one of those albums that is the standard.  Original, yes, but extremely reflective and poetic:  art at a level that is rarely reached.  Even if you disagree with their views, you can't help but deny their ability to capture the aesthetic.  The emotions of what they sing of are related to the listener in such a way that is rarely felt in most music.  Download a few songs and check it out for yourself.  You won't be dissappointed. This album didn't take getting used to.  This album has never grown tiresome.  You can listen to this album from start to finish.  (Well, actually, you can stop when those extra Blind session recordings come in  following the excellent hidden track.)  The album flows together very well.  The two followup albums are both very good but this album still sets the  standard.  Although &quot;Flood&quot; got all the attention, I consider the  high points to be &quot;Lovesong for a Savior&quot; and &quot;He.&quot;  &quot;He&quot; is as beautiful a song as I've heard.  I'm not a crier, but  that song has brought tears to my eyes. This album is the first Christian band album that really attracted my attention.  My wife bought it for me when I was deployed to Bosnia.  I used to listen to it on my portable CD player all the time. More recently, I have been listening to other bands, but I have not forgotten the album that started my quest for great Christian bands--Jars of Clay.Simply put, this album is great.  The best songs are &quot;Liquid&quot;, &quot;Sinking&quot;, &quot;Boy on a string&quot;, &quot;Art in me&quot;, and &quot;Flood&quot;.  The songs fit very well together, and make for a great listen.  I highly recommend this album for anyone looking for a great Christian band.  Their songs reminds me of Toad the Wet Sprocket, so if you like that sort of sound you will definitely like this album. 1. Liquid2. Sinking3. Love Song for a Savior4. Like a Child5. Art in Me6.

The rhythm, bass and strings all mesh together in beautiful harmony. I love the arrangement of &quot;He&quot;. I was digging through my CD collection and recently pulled out this gem. I am hearing the lyrics for the first time so to speak and it sends chills down my spine. Not alot of music can do that to me these days. Jars Of Clay's debut album is a true modern rock masterpiece--honest, heartfelt, and unforgettable.  Q: What do they sound like?  Click on Amazon's sample tracks and prepare to hear a band unlike any that's out  today.  Obviously inspired by their Christian faith, JOC will appeal to  most everyone, regardless of their spiritual upbringing.  Their songs are  very easy to listen to, and you will probably find yourself playing them  over and over, getting melodically and mentally intertwined with their  songs--each one is highly recommended!!  If you didn't know this, there is  a &quot;secret track&quot; on the last cut of th e album that is about 6  minutes into the last song that really rocks, as well as a recorded session  of Jars Of Clay practicing on the last track as well that lasts several  minutes.  FYI: Other bands that I like and recommend include:  DC Talk,  Todd Rundren &amp; Utopia, ELO, Eric Champion, Audio Adrenaline, Smalltown  Poets, the 77's, Steven Curtis Chapman, Michael W. Smith,Supertones,  Aaron/Jeoffrey, Avalon...enjoy! Every song on this Cd has something great to offer anyone that even remotely appreciates music.  If you heard &quot;Flood,&quot; and were impressed that song scratched the surface of an intensly beautiful album.  I bought this album originally five years ago, and have bought it twice  since, just because I couldn't sacrifice any of the tracks to skips from  scratches, probably from moving it back and fourth from my house stereo to  my car stereo.  if you don't have it, you should When I heard the song &quot;Flood&quot; on Christian radio, I instantly fell in love with it. A year later when I heard it on mainstream radio, I knew I had to buy this album. Ugh..I'm sorry I did. &quot;Flood&quot; is  the *only* reason to buy this album; the rest of the songs don't even  measure up to it's greatness (in fact, they are quite boring.) So, if you  really love the song &quot;Flood&quot;, get this CD. Otherwise, skip it. Nearly 13 years after this album was released I still count it at the top of my list of greatest albums ever made. I was only [...] when this came out, and at that time I had no clue the impact this peice of art would have on my life. I sat patiently with my boombox and made a recorded copy of the tape my sister had bought. I listened to that for years until it finally broke, and I was forced to buy the cd. The cd got the same treatment. And after years of use was so scratched that it would no longer play, So I downloaded the MP3 copy of the album. I am an avid music listener, with everything from country to death metal on my ipod, but this album will always top the list. The music here is amazing, but the lyrics are what will hit you at your core and never let off. The themes here range from simple praises to serious heartsearching. And not once does Dan Haseltine cram religion down your throat. That is what made this accesible to anybody, Christian or non. Althought my life has greatly changed since I was[...], this cd still lifts me up whenever I need, and thats what amazing music should do.My Favorite Tracks.Flood, Boy on a String, Faith Like a Child, and Worlds Apart. what can I say, I'm a fan, and this cd is one of they're best, it's just Awesome! Great Christian folk artist. It's mellow but not too mellow and the lyrics are great. My favorite song on this CD is ""Flood"". I like the way this Christian band started out. I really enjoy listening to it on the road. I WOULD recommend this. One great CD. It is probably one of the greatest CDs ever. Each song is so beautifully written and the melody is great. My personal favorite song is &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;. It is a great song and it gives me a sense of &quot;euphoria&quot; to some extent. I recommend it to all those who search the Lord. This is one of the best albums ever made. There is not much more to say than that.Unlike their later albums, this album is almost entirely accoustic. (There is one electric guitar on &quot;He&quot;, but it's barely noticeable.) Also, unlike their later albums, this album stands as one complete work in and of itself. You won't want to listen to just one song, you will want to hear the whole thing, over and over again. The lyrics are beautiful, the music is masterful. In my opinion, this is the best album ever made.  Period.  From start to finish, Jars of Clay is a powerful testament to God's incredible love and mercy.  You'll find yourself singing the refrain from &quot;Love Song for a  Savior&quot; over and over after listening to it.  Your heart will go out  to all the victims of child abuse after listening to the song  &quot;He&quot;.  You'll see everyone around you in a new light after  hearing &quot;Art in Me&quot;.  And my favorite song of this track, and the  one which gets my vote as best Christian song ever, is &quot;Worlds  Apart&quot;.  From the moment I first heard it, my life was changed  forever, and for the better.  And every time I listen to it, I feel myself  becoming more and more submissive to God's will.  The sheer humility in the  singer's voice (especially during the last part of the song) is  overwhelming, and has helped me battle the pride that has so often been a  stumbling block in my life.  This is one of those albums that you grow to  love more and more each time you hear it, and its appeal only seems to grow  with each passing day.  This one is a must for any who call themselves  Christian music fans. This is, IMHO, the best Jars of Clay album. It's the one that put them on the map in Christian music. After this cd, their stuff just didn't seem to measure up anymore. I listen to this cd and it's got to be about 20yrs old now. Still a great album. I think i was 8 or 9 years old when i bought this album...I am 15 now and i have to say that this cd is still among my top 10 favorite cds. It gets better every time that i listen to it, and i learn to apreciate it more. I love the acoustic feel of this album and the fact that they use strings on alot of the songs. It is a rad album. I haven't been AS impressed with their newer work, but they are still a solid band. This self-titled album, although it only has 10 songs, is their best work to date.  BUY THIS ALBUM!!! Awesome. Great diversity of instruments and song subjects. Interesting voices. All time classic Christian Rock CD. Songs played on the radio stations are separated as religions are in churches. Certain stations are devoted to rap, while others strictly play country. There are the pop stations and the alternative rock stations. Sometimes, radio stations will simply play whatever is popular, making the mixing of genres not so uncommon. However, it is very uncommon for secular stations to play a Christian song on air, until recently when Mercy Me's song, ""I Can Only Imagine,"" received a lot of play on pop stations. In the mid 90's, a new Christian band was introduced to the music industry. As most Christian artists are first recognized on Christian stations, this band made themselves known on secular radio stations. Their first release was played on both alternative and pop stations, as well as Christian stations. This band is Jars of Clay, and though they have several albums out today, the album that started their career is absolutely amazing.Jars of Clay thoroughly expressed their abilities to produce an individual style in sounds and lyrics on their first album. Each song on the album holds a unique excellence, in that none of them are similar in sound, with the exception of the instruments used. As soon as a flowing melody is listened to, the next track pops up out of nowhere with a more upbeat tune.First time listeners are exposed to Jars of Clay's talent when they hear ""Liquid"", the song that launches off the album. The dramatic introduction of the album chimes in with the cry of the violin and deep beat hanging on behind the vocals. The lyrics are devoted to the death of Christ on the cross, with the strength of the words singing ""Blood-stained brow, He wasn't broken for nothing / Arms nailed down, He didn't die for nothing"" and the repetition of ""This is the one thing, the one thing that I know."" The song fades out with the strings to end it.Jars of Clay is renowned for their song entitled ""Flood"", which hit secular radio stations in 1995. ""Flood"" was their first release off their self-titled debut album from Essential Records. The guys of the band took a big plunge into the secular music industry with the release of this song. They proved themselves to be a light shining in a dark world by the words of the chorus intended to be a cry out to God, ""Lift me up - when I'm falling / Lift me up - I'm weak and I'm dying / Lift me up - I need You to hold me / Lift me up - keep me from drowning again"". ""Flood"" begins with the low, intense voice of Dan Haseltine, while the guitar haunts the background. Then, with a burst of rhythmic energy, the chorus jumps in loud and strong, only to slow back down afterwards. The bridge takes the song to a whole different level, softening the seriousness that the intro and chorus offers. The violins calm the setting and fixed idea of the stressful flood. The lyrics of the bridge flow right along with the melody of the smooth strings and softer voice that sings ""Calm the storms that drench my eyes / Dry the streams still flowing / Casting down all waves of sin / And guilt that overflow me"". But sure enough, as the last lyric is sung, the chorus picks right back up, and the song ends with the unforgettable tune of the guitar.""Flood"" was a good strong start to Jars of Clay's music career, but the alternative song was opposed by their next release ""Love Song for a Savior,"" which played only on Christian radio stations. It is a beautiful song about the process of growing in the Christian walk with God, hence the lyrics of the chorus that repeat ""I want to fall in love with You."" The melodic guitar and relaxing vocals allow the listener to experience how powerful God is and what it means to love Him. The sounds of the song are like taking a deep breath and being satisfied with the good, long exhale.Jars of Clay reveals their sympathy with the song ""He,"" touching on the subject of child abuse. Listeners are sucked into the world of a broken-hearted child as the song begins with the distant sounds of a playground. ""Don't try to reach me, I'm already dead"" is the opening verse, allowing the listener to grasp the emotions of the situation. The band captures the pain of abused children as they play the role of a child questioning, ""Daddy, don't you love me / Then why do you hit me / And momma don't you love me / Then why do you hurt me."" Hope is found towards the ending of the song, as it beautifully ends echoing descriptions of God.""Like a Child"" is one of the more upbeat songs on the album. The lyrics are written as a letter to God. The mood of the song is set when the first verse plunges right into the plucking of the guitar strings, then jumps into the happiness of the chorus. ""Like a Child"" is about being able to do all things through Christ who strengthens us with having the faith of a little child. Jars of Clay displays this theme well through the tone and lyrics of the song and the feeling of wanting to add motion to the fun beats and rhythms used.As the way of everything, all good things must come to an end. The album is brought to an end with the song titled ""Blind."" The sleepy tunes wind down the adventure of the previous nine songs. The soft, orchestral sounds of the song naturally establishes a mellow mood. ""Blind"" is the most tuned-down song on the album, but is able to express the band's talent just as much as the other songs. All ten songs bring forth the journey of the bright and God-inspired minds of Jars of Clay. However, if these songs weren't enough to fulfill the end of the album, listen for a pleasant and melodic surprise about two minutes after the last song. Just when the good sounds are thought to have come to an end, more talent is scooped onto the plate... Do not let the above description fool you. Jars of Clay are in no way to be confused with the Rembrandts--they are so much more! Even if you are not into contemporary Christian music, you will love this band's work. I find that all of their albums fall into that &quot;never grow tired of hearing them&quot; category that so few cd's in my collection fall under. Exquisite lyrics and harmonies overlay a lush textural collage of music. Stupendous! After hearing Jars of Clay's first single off this CD, &quot;Flood&quot;, on the radio, I immediatly wanted to hear more. When I heard the CD I was sold. I knew that this CD and band would be one of my favorites for a long time to come.The CD starts off with &quot;Liquid&quot; which has an almost creepy gregorian chant in it. The acoustic guitars then come in and that sets the sound for the rest of the CD. This CD consists of acoustic guitars and on some songs, &quot;Flood&quot; for example, violens. The Jars get their distinct acoustic sounds from tuning their guitars differently than is standard. This simple task creates an incredibly wonderful sound.The music is strong and the lyrics are incredibly deep. Ranging from the depiction of crucifiction (&quot;Liquid&quot;) to child abuse (&quot;He&quot;) to a love song (&quot;Love Song for a Savior&quot;). Along with the rich lyrics are vocals that easily convey the emotions of the songs. With a great lead vocalist (Dan Haseltine) and beautiful background vocals (Steve Mason and Charlie Lowell) you feel touched by each song.The music, lyrics, and vocals just work nearly perfectly on this album which includes my favorite song, &quot;Worlds Apart.&quot; This song took the longest to write on the album. The band wanted to make sure the lyrics and music was perfect. I couldn't agree more. If you love music with great acoustic guitars then you will love this. If you love &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;rock&quot; then you will enjoy this as well. This is a multi-faceted CD that everone should hear. ...and i still enjoy it just as much as i did when i first opened it.  This is in my opinion Jars best album to date, it will appeal to a crowd drawn to a more melodic, acoustic, timeless type of sound.  It will not appeal to people who are looking for top of the line, wicked head banging, rave dancing drum beats.  This is a great album to just listen to, letting it play in the back ground while studying, working, reading, or sit down with it and really just reflect in prayer letting the savior minister to your soul.  The lyrics are poetic, deep, and meaningful, i only wish Jars would go back and re-create this type of sound with a new album. I wasn't expecting this CD to be so great.  I bought this album for &quot;Flood&quot; and was blown away by the power of the music and lyrics.  It's a nice touch the way they use the acoustic guitar with a strong drum  beat.  If you're looking for some good Christian music (or just some good  music in general) be sure to buy this CD. im not going to do a in depth review, all im going to say is its a classic you must own. Jars of Clay makes its noticable and well deserved entrance on to the music scene with this powerful combination of great, original sound and powerful lyrics that go straight to the heart of any serious worshipper  looking to see God glorified in the Contemporary music scene. Love song for  a Savior and Worlds Apart are two examples of songs that put into words  perfectly that which is on so many of our hearts as we come before the  King. A very worthy investment! though I'm coming from a more secular-angle than most on here I'm sure, this album is very special. I haven't heard it for a little while, having just discovered it, I loved it the first time I heard then meant to listen again, and today I had to go through it, and it is so wonderful. No wonder it is a timeless work that can be enjoyed endlessly. great stuff. Has a better song than, &quot;Love Song for a Savior,&quot; ever been written by a contemporary christian artist/group?  Doubtful.  I narrowly missed attending Greenville college (located in the remote corn fields of  southern illinois) during the same year the Jars guys were there.  I own an  indie copy of the Cd the rest of Jars worshipping world knows as their  self-titled debut.  Believe it or not, the songs on &quot;Jars of  Clay&quot; sounded even better before they were re-mastered, re-cut, and  re-produced for mass market appeal.  What I love about the songs on this  album is that the messages are so subtle, yet so poignant.  Their songs are  actually parables.  Check out, &quot;Boy on a string&quot; with lyrics  like, &quot;watching the life that he created run away.&quot;  This is a  powerful statement with a deeper application than the sadness felt by a  puppet maker upon losing his most prized creation.  This is a wonderfully  creative and emotionally powerful description of God's longing for the  people He's fashioned with His own hands to remain in relationship with  Him, only to suffer the loss of the fellowship of our hearts time and time  again throughout history. This album is filled with hidden song writing  masterpieces like this.  To think that these songs were written by 19 and  20 year olds is staggering.  Consider this lyric from &quot;Love Song for a  Savior,&quot; &quot;a great salvation.... calls to the people, who stare  into nowhere and can't fill the chains on their souls.&quot;  Whoa, the  weight of the truth conveyed here is strongly felt.  If there's a central  theme encapsulating the music on this CD, or any Jars CD, it would best be  described as an artful portrayal of the human experience in light of the  love God has for us all.  There is so much hype surrounding this band that  it's difficult to focus on what's really breathtaking about their music,  which is its ability to paint such stunning pictures of God's heart for  frail human beings.  Buy this CD for yourself and for everyone you consider  a friend.  Enjoy. This was my first favorite Christian CD.  It's got upbeat songs like 'Like A Child' and 'Flood', and more mellow songs like 'Blind' and 'Worlds Apart'. After listening to all of Jars of Clay CDs, I believe this title,the first of the pack, to be the best. The lyrics, written somewhat like poetry, make the CD worth listening to over and over and over. We've owned this CD since 1995 and it continues to get played every week in our house. The lyrics are sometimes obscure; which I love to listen to and try to figure out the orginal meaning the band was trying to get across. Depending on the mood I'm in, I can find a different meaning for the same song. I never knew this CD was popular on the pop radio stations. It doesn't surprise me since Jars of Clay is no typical Chrisitan band. &quot;HE&quot; tends to be my favorite song with its soulful woes on the pain of trying to be perfect.  The times when I feel the need to connect with God, I turn off the lights, sit in my glider rocking chair, and close my eyes while listening to the lyrics glide with the music playing. Time after time, I find tears running down my face by the end of the CD. When I was in labor with my first child last year, this CD was the only type of music I could stand to listen to. I turned up the volume full blast, shut my eyes, and endured the pain. That is what this CD makes you do - shut out the outside world and focus on God! I got this CD more than 10 years ago, and it was on repeat in my CD player for years. Even now, it sounds just as current and accessible and moving as it did then. Jars has made plenty of good albums since, but this one still far outshines them all for me. Every song is perfect, honest, beautiful, intimate, nothing held back. Buy it now. Even if you are jaded by how generally dissapointing Christian music has become. I had alot of trouble with the Amazon player as it did not mesh well with my Windows XP. The product was eventually usable and was complete in form. Most people are pushed away from Christianity because all they've ever heard of is some preacher from South Carolina yelling, &quot;Repent, ye sinners!&quot;. Jars of Clay conveys the message of what Christianity is  really all about: a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. This album  gets better every time I listen to it. You can listen to it all the way  through. It's a beautiful thing. I don't often base how much I like music on the lyrics, I listen for  overall sound, but this music has both impactful lyrics as well as richly  detailed sound.  I have only recently discovered Jars of Clay but I am  seriously impressed!  And whats even better than the sound is that they are  a Christian band that doesn't sound like a Christian band...  The lyrics  are inspiring and thought provoking and I can listen to this CD over and  over from school to work to home and back. Like most people, the first song I heard from Jars of Clay was ""Flood"".  Over the years, ""Flood"" has remained a favorite at concerts.  Without question, Jars of Clay's first released is by far their best album.  While that may seem a little sad that they haven't been able to match or surpass this album, it also goes to show just how good this album is.  ""Love Song for a Savior"" is a beautiful song written to Jesus simply saying I Love You.  ""Like a Child"" reminds us what kind of faith we should have.  There are more recognizable songs from this album than any other by Jars of Clay.  At a concert, it feels like a significant portion of the set list is from this album....and that's not a bad thing at all. This is one of the best Chrsitian Cd's out there. In the world we live in now many teenagers struggle with themselves, a lot of them not having a person realationship  with Jesus. This CD is also a great place to turn. When I first heard the  music at a youth group, I loved it, and when my sister offered to give me  the first two CD's (Jars of Clay, Much Afraid) I didn't turn down the  offer. Turn here if you want great Christian music! This is a breathe of fresh air from all the music that is out there today, especially in Christian music. From the lyrics, to the music prgrossions, they are an original band. With that said, this CD is personally in my opinion Jars of Clay's masterpiece album. Every band out there has one. Sometimes it's their first other times it's their second or third. But in Jars of Clay's case, this is ""the"" Jars of Clay CD. This record has inspired and baffled me for 17 years! It was one of my first records I ever got. Superior musicianship went into its making. I think you can hear a bit of every musical style that was known at the time it was made. It's a thoughtful, worshipful record that I think anyone could like regardless whether they believe in Christ or not. May I be inspired and baffled for 17 more years! Thanks Jars! :) How long can a synth drum beat boom if a boom could chick chick boom?  Unable to afford a $100 drum kit, Jars of Clay decided that it'd be best to self-produce all but 2 of the songs on this album and I can't say I agree with that decision.  ""Liquid"" and ""Flood"" reflect the social atmosphere of the world with bands like Nine Inch Nails (same producer) and Pearl Jam at their prime.  Well mixed, well played and well performed, these two songs are what attracted me to Jars' sound and have made me a fan since `96.  But the other lyrically AMAZING and HORRIBLY produced songs on this album leave a bad taste in the mouth.  After listening to ""Like a Child"", ""Art in Me"", ""He"" and ""Boy on a String"" you are going to despise two things.  First, the idea of over-dubbing inaudible little children's voices and that stupid crappy synth beat.  As a Jars fan, it makes me cry to think of the potential these four songs could have if decently recorded.  When the drum beat kicks in on ""He"", you just pretty much give up.  It's not until ""Worlds Apart"" do you hear the chance that this band is more than just special.  As one of the all time best songs in my life, ""Worlds Apart"" sneaks in and Stairway to Heavens us to death, it's breath taking.  In all, this is a debut album that marks an important journey for Jars.  If you don't mind a good old bumpin while listening to an album, I highly recommend it. If &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; doesn't tear your heart out, you don't have  one.  This is by far the best Christian album I've ever heard.  Deeply  spiritual, in love with God, but doesn't rely on Christian jargon or  identity politics.  Make no mistake...this music is about a personal  relationship with Jesus.  To miss that is to misunderstand the music. But  Jesus is for everyone and so is this album. OK so maybe this one is not as new as other CDs you might buy here. Everybody knows Flood and almost everybody knows Liquid. But I've been listening to this one lately and I'm still amazed at how they don't make MUSIC, they make ART. No matter how old this one gets, the string arrangements are still exquisite, the percussion is still perfect, the guitars are still tight and tasty, the slight harmonies are still gorgeous, and Dan Haseltine's voice is still soulful and addictive. Not only that, but I never understood some songs on this one until I got to a certain point in my relationship with God. I used to listen to it and think &quot; 'Take my world apart'? Wouldn't he rather have his world put together? 'I want to fall in love with You'? What does he mean by that? Why does he want to be so close to God?&quot; It took four years from when it first came out for me to understand it. You won't be disappointed in this one. For many reasons this cd holds a dear place in my heart. Each time I see it laying on a clearance or discount shelf I have to rescue it and find someone who will appreciate it for the treasure that it is. It's great for chilling to especially tracks ""Art in me"", ""Blind"",  and ""He"". Great for rocking out in the car to, ""Liquid"", ""Boy on a string"", and ""Flood"". And also great for worshipping to ""Love song for a Savior"" and ""Worlds apart"". It has a very distinct driving acoustic feel that was and continues to be fresh and different. Do youself a favor and own multiple copies of this cd so you can share with a friend! This is the first Christian album I ever owned and what lead me on my way to becoming a Christian.  This is still the best Jars of Clay album and each song is still relevant today as it was 15 years ago. When I buy a Christian music CD, I'm looking for a few key things.  1)  Music with which to appease the volatile iron-age god that I worship.  You know the one.  The one who is willing to consign his own creations who happen to not earn his approval through correct theological affirmations to an eternity of suffering.  That's right, the one who told his chosen people in the old testament to slaughter the women and children of conquered cities in his name.  And yes, if you insist, he did also demand that his own son be tortured an killed to appease some sort of twisted blood debt owed by the creatures that he himself also created to be exactly as they are.  And yes, if you persist in pointing it out, he did also know that said creations would not hew to his rigid (and unrealistic) expectations of them from the moment they were created.  And yes, even though his son was tortured and killed for them, he is still more than willing to condemn them to an eternity of suffering if their theology is off, or heaven forbid, they are raised in a culture that follows some other god.  But back to my point.  I expect some paint-peeling death metal to properly appease such a blood thirsty god.  This weak, fuzzy, wimpy stuff will never appease the god of Christianity, and thus should never be marketed as ""Christian music"".  Thank You. Jars of Clay hit the music scene at a time in my life when I had graduated from college and I loved the alternative rock bands Collective Soul, Toad The Wet Sprocket and Weezer (I still do) but I didn't know Jesus. I grew up thinking being faithful was Jesus+church, works, etc. The song Flood came out on the radio and MTV and I needed to hear more by this new band, similar to how I felt about The Fray's debut album in 2005.The first few seconds of Liquid had me hooked on Jars of Clay (and ultimately Jesus) forever. The Gregorian Chant, the driving beat and then the completely spiritual lyrics floored me and made me want to know Jesus as did my other favorite songs Love Song For A Savior, which really is my story as I longed to fall in love with Jesus, and Worlds Apart, an all-time classic which just wrecks you if you really pray along with the song.Ultimately this is one of the all-time best albums in the history of Christian music and it led me to seek Christ for which I'm eternally grateful. &quot;No way!&quot; That was my first reaction when I heard 'Liquid' from this album. The Gregorian chant starts the first song off and nothing will ever be the same again! This is one CORNERSTONE album for music lovers all  round the world. The crystal clear voice of Dan Haseltine, and the musical  prowess of Steve Mason, Matt Odmark and Charlie Lowell has redefined music  with their very own musical style unlike any other. Unbelievably  imaginatively magnificent!!! I was introduced to Jars of Clay by a very religious friend of mine. We  were listening to the cd and I immediately fell in love with the album.  &quot;Love Song for a Savior&quot; gives me memories of my friends who live  in other states, since it has special meaning for all of it.  &quot;Flood&quot; is a good one, which was the song I had heard a few years  before and liked, but never persused the artist. The haunting vocals can  make me cry at times, but at the same time, fill me with awe, since they  sing so beautifully. As stated earlier, I am an atheist, but still hold Jar  of Clay and this album as one of my favorites of all time. Check out their  other stuff!! It's just as good. 1.  Liquid2.  Sinking3.  Love Song for a Savior4.  Like a Child5.  Art in Me6.  He7.  Boy on a String8.  Flood9.  Worlds Apart10. Blind I ordered this CD just for the Flood title, but have realized it is so much more than that one song.  I use it to work out to in the morning.  My Spirit gets reenergized while my body gets healthier.  It's absolutely wonderful! Undoubtedly one of the best CDs released last decade. Being a fanatic of the acoustic guitar it's not hard to notice how the simple, yet exuberant string arrangements in this compilation transcended the  contemporary-versus-spiritual barrier. Most of the songs are deeply  introspective, and it's tough not to mirror the meaning of those words to  one's life. 'He' and 'Worlds Apart' stands out as two of the most moving  songs I've heard. There is something about Haseltine's voice which is as  innocent and soothing as a gentle breeze -- it makes his acknowledgement of  pain and confusion all the more difficult to bear. Yet there is the music  .... I cannot recommend this compilation well enough ... it's an ensemble  of very well-written and beautifully orchestrated songs -- highly  diversified, spiritually uplifting -- yet does not resort to overpreaching  to get its message across. This is one of my favorite CDs of all-time and Jars of Clay's best. The lyrics are skin-deep, heartfelt, and will almost bring you to tears. The acoustic and melodic sounds are refreshing and serene. The heaviest songs on the CD aren't too loud and match the content of each song especially ""Liquid"" which is a beautiful song about the Crucifixion but also hard-hitting with New Age-like sounds and a good way to start of the CD. My favorites include ""Love Song For a Savior"" which is peaceful and beautiful and ""Flood"" just because it is still acoustic but can be considered rock-alternative. But in my opinion the best song is ""World's Apart"" which is a song of conviction which literally brought me to tears and it really makes you think. This is the type of song you put on during a rain storm, a lay-in-a-comfy-spot-close-your-eyes-to-and-play-over-and-over-again melodic piece of art. I recommend to everyone because in a loud world full of sit up and decipher songs, this is lay back and let it sink in music that isn't too religion oriented and not too in-your-face. I really give it 4 and a half stars. This album is much better than their later offerings. Jars of Clay took the Christian music industry by storm in 1995 when they burst onto the scene with this CD.  Everyone was listening to it and talking about it.  Being a leader who loves to be ahead of the trends...I bought the CD earlier this year.Ok, ok, so I'm stubborn.  I willingly admit I was an idiot for not getting this CD sooner.  It's great!  The combination of stringed instruments into a rock sound is worth the price alone.  But the lyrics are great.  Heartfelt and poetic, they take several listenings and some thought to understand, unlike most music out there today.  Personally, I'm drawn to the helplessness apart from God of ""Like a Child,"" the prayer of submission of ""Worlds Apart,"" and the reliance (and fun) of ""Flood.""Every song here in enjoyable.  I wish I'd gotten it sooner so I could have enjoyed it longer.  I'm certainly going to give their other CD's a try. A true benchmark of whether or not a Christian release is a success is if an album is heavily produced yet you don't notice it is. The best example of that is this introductory release by Jars of Clay. I remember when this album first came out I really thought Jars of  Clay would be the true answer to overproduced, Elefante-ed Christian music (see most every Petra album since the late '80s.) For the most part, it really was at the time. My, how things have changed. Jars of Clay hasbeen an utter disappointment since this  release. This album is very beautiful, the songs are heartfelt and well written. Every song on this album is Christian Music single quality, and it was played that way as well. Jars biggest mistake was probably peaking too early. Another problem they had was  translating their rather prog-rock/alternative fusion to the stage. If I was their tour manager, I would have invested in a small string section to properly tour the band. They instead opted for straight keyboard playing to replace strings. This never works. It could have worked if they had synthesized their live sound a little more  using the keyboard, but not the way they attempted to do it. Of course, their tour was still successful, due mainly to the strength of this release. But what do we hear in their follow up releases? Overproduced Christian alternative rock. As for this album, I say  BUY IT!! It is well worth it. Just don't waste your money on anything else they do, and that includes live performances. It's a shame that Jars of Clay  turned out to be a one-trick pony. They had so much potential. Boring and unispired! A waste of my money and time. This is a great CD - had me hooked from the first listen. I've never heard any of their music before but this is a fine introduction. It's varied but involving with quite profound lyrics when you take the time to listen, and  catch tunes when you don't.Totally a CD I wouldn't want to be without. This is an oustanding album - so easy to get in to and yet loads of depth. Totally enjoyable from the first listening with tunes that just stick in your head, and lyrics to make you think.I recommend this to anyone. Jars of Clay scare me. I have never heard anything this satanic or dark  all my life. But they still rock. This s/t album is the best album by them.  Its worty a purchase. Let me first state that I am Jewish and I think this is one of the most beautiful cds I have ever heard. Of course the lyrics aren't really for me... but the music and the singing and the musicianship is incredible. Amazing band. Recommended for anyone who loves awesome music, even if you're not Christian. My dad bought this cd for me about three years ago.  When I first got it I tossed it aside amongst the other cds that I own.  One day I picked it up and decided to listen to it.  What I found out was this was one of the best cds I had ever heard.  Jars of Clay puts their heart and soul into this cd as they praise the Lord.  They use an accoustic guitar and soothing vocals to make this an absolutely wonderful cd.  Number three Love Song for a Savior is my favorite, it is beautiful. This album is, quite simply, amazing. At first I thought it would be just  like any other Christian band, but there is something about Dan Haseltine's  voice that really makes you sit up and listen. It is so calm and yet so  strong. I am not generally an emotional person, but the song Worlds Apart  really made me sob. Listen carefully to the drums - the intensity of the  rhythm and the passion with which they are played is just fantastic. So  this album, and their other music, is DEFINITELY worth your while. I would  pay heaps more for it than I have to. How heavy do you expect a Christian group to be? Honestly, do you people buy CDs just to trash them? If you don't like the style then don't buy the music. If you like the style but don't like the group, then say why.I'm 23, married, and Christian, and I can't get enough of Jars of Clay (or Superchick for that matter). I'm going to sing them both at Karaoke Night next week. I hope I get pelted with tomatoes and thrown out on my arse. There's not much middle ground with Jesus. Either you try hard to make him yours or you try hard to make him go away, but there's no yawning through him. This is pure and simple one of the absolute best albums I have ever heard. It is definitely one of my favorites of all time and just may very well be #1 on my list. Now I do have an eclectic taste for music because I enjoy music from Christian to pop to classical to country to rock and roll, and just recently I got some Rolling Stones and those albums are really great too, but unlike some of my other albums it seems like I just keep on coming back to this one every now and again. I've had it since Christmas of 1996 and it is still an album that I can honestly say I don't tire of, will never tire of, and is an honest to goodness masterpiece. None of their other albums have even come close to this one, and just recently I purchased this one again for the first time on cd to replace my well-worn cassette copy. This is Jars of Clay's magnum opus much like Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Bat Out Of Hell are Elton John's and Meat Loaf's magnum opuses as well. Their other albums just do not compare to this magnificent debut one. The Eleventh Hour in particular is really bad and is one of the worst albums I've ever heard. This album is definitely worth buying and treasuring forever, and you can bet that Jesus himself would feel pleased to have this album in His collection. Jars of Clay are a Christian Band. That is what they believe in and that is what they write about. The great thing about this album however is that it can be enjoyed by people who are not hot on religion. It is not forced  down you and although this can be seen as a Christian album for Christians  the songs like Worlds apart, He and Flood can be enjoyed by everyone.  Anyway - Christian will have different tastes in music surely. This album  is not about preaching and although messages are there this is about music.What we have here is a band singing about something they believe in and  how is this any different to bands singing about freedom, poverty, love and  all the others things that artists believe in? The only problem is that  Jars of Clay are singing about something that not everyone believes in, but  I'm making that point that the music can still be enjoyed and it is no  different to listening to bands like Machine Head, KISS, Celine Dion or  Rage against the machine. The first song I heard was Worlds Apart and I  knew nothing about the band. Finding out that they were Christian wasn't  going to stop me listened to them. What I heard was the music which I liked  and I think thats most important.So back to what's important. There is  a largely acoustic influence on this album. Great Acoustic riffs like  Flood, Art in Me and Love song for a Saviour are a pleasure to listen to.  The well written chorus of He and the wonderful Boy on a string are all  highlights. Worlds Apart is the peak of the mountain for me. The whole song  is a wonderful journey with emotional chorus' and an exquisite ending  arrangement which will be played time and time again.There are also  little touches which I particularly like. A song like Love song for a  saviour has examples of originally like the decisively simple but beautiful  harmonics which end the intro riff, the introduction of the drums in the  second bar of the chorus and the flute which echoes after the chorus.  Another example is the opening song Liquid which has wonderful drums which  are played in the chorus and they are allowed to play without lyrics for  the first chorus. Boy on a string has a viola driven introduction before a  change into the verse. Little touches like these are a breath of fresh air  when I hear them.Jars of Clay have produced an acoustic Christian  listeners dream and for other acoustic listeners it brings about nothing  less if they are prepared to be open minded and let the music do the  talking. One of the best album's that I've ever listened to.  Jars of Clay is a refreshing blend of meaningful lyrics and acoustic guitar, mixed in with some really cool instrument solos.  Get it! END The cover of the album alone should tell you that this is gonna be one heck of a debut album. Just look how cool they look standin there in that tone of color. Anyway amazing album and one of the greatest CCM Cd debuts of all time! I bought this cd not knowing that they where a christian band but I guess it shouldn't matter. I am all about the music and I love being a musician becuase it helps you apreciate music alot more with out saying oh they are jesus freaks they suck or, there name is godsmack? that is stanic! I am anti-christ and I don't like any form of christianity. But that doesn't mean I can't enjoy music some one is making who thinks differently than I do. I like the acoustics in the cd and it seems very positive. It is more soft than what I usually listen to but I still enjoy it. If you like acoustics and are free minded about music then buy this album. There other albums arent bad either but remember this is a really soft band. All I can say is that this CD is outstanding. Thank God for newer bands like these guys and SNTR. I didn't like it a whole lot first time through, but the melodies and lyrics really grow on you. I highly recommend  listeners give it a couple of tries. This band is very talented and their  music is outstanding. This is one of the best acoustic albumns ever! Even after 13 years I still love listening to these songs, and they don't feel outdated at all. If you have never heard this albumn I suggest you get a hold of it and have a listen because you are in for a real treat. Full of clever, meaningful lyrics, interesting melodies, with strings used extensively for delightful countermelodies. You won't be let down by this one! I bought this CD 11 years ago when it first came out.  After more than a decade, it still sits in the #1 slot in my changer.  Although ""Flood"" is the song from this CD which received the most airplay, I feel it is the least representative of the work as a whole.  Those who bought it specifically for this particular song may have been disappointed by the rest of the CD.  Some reviewers stated that they very much disliked the drum tracks on some of the selections, but they never bothered me - there is so much more to enjoy.  The music on this CD has an exquisitely woven texture of acoustic melodies and intimately poignant lyrics which never cease to inspire me to honest reflection.  Jars of Clay does not offer the stereotypical ""praise-fest,"" but instead lays bare the realities of a personal search for spirituality and oneness with God.  Pride and self-doubt, innocence and shame, sorrow and hope, and thankfulness for a Savior are colored through the tracks with what I can only call ""powerful delicacy.""  The acoustics and strings are so soulfully and interestingly layered with the vocals that I can listen to a single track several times in a row and be drawn in by something different each time.  I generally tire very quickly of songs and so invest in precious little music.  This is the only CD I have ever owned that I could literally let play, track after track, repeatedly, for hours.  The sound has not become dated and I have never grown weary of it.  This is my ""If you were trapped on a desert island and could only have one..."" CD.I know many non-Christians who also enjoy this CD.  One stated that he was so impressed by the music that he had bought this for everyone on his Christmas list that particular year.  It perhaps has a sound which is more appealing to an older more reflective audience - I'm in my 40's now, and I also very much like the more acoustic GooGoo Dolls and Matchbox 20. I certainly would not classify JoC as ""boy band,"" as some other reviewers have done.  After years of regular listening, this CD continues to bring me countless hours of enjoyment.  It receives the highest recommendation I can give. This is a great introduction to Jars of Clay for novices. You can sense their youth in this c.d., as it is their first, but that's what makes it so wonderful-because it has such raw, innocent beauty. ""Flood"" is by far their most recognized song in history, but is as equally good as other songs like ""Love Song for a Savior"" and ""Worlds Apart"". ""He"" is about child abuse from the child's mind, and is very sad. ""Worlds Apart"" is my favorite song, as it describes every Christian's struggle to give God our desires and let him mold us to want more of Him and less of the world. ""Flood"" is intense and the darkest on the album. It talks about those times when we have lost all hope and feel like we are drowning in our problems. ""Love Song for a Savior"" is a beautiful melodic love song, expressing our desire to ""fall in love"" with our Father. A hint if you get this c.d.: wait after the final track a couple of minutes and you will hear a bonus track entitled ""4:7"". It is a very cool rendition of the ""Jars of Clay"" Bible verse, in 2 corinthians. After that is a studio recording of ""Blind"" and supposedly, you can hear people talking about the O.J. Simpson trial in the background!(Though I couldn't make it out, because it was too far away). Saw them in concert with my daughter.  Recognized ""Flood"".  My daughter asked for the cd for X-Mas.  We all love it! the lyrics are inspirational.. the music is amazing.. don't miss this.. if you're a music lover.. you're going to love this. I had the cassete tape of this album when I was a teen, I liked it alot back then but then I backslid, and decided to get rid of my christian music tapes. This is one of those rare albums for me where I like every single song on the album. I can play the whole cd and not have the need to change the song. This band has so much talent and I have felt the annointing of God upon the band more than once. How often do you hear violins in rock type music where they use guitars and many other instruments? This album/cd is truly one of their best.  The songs are very inspired and will touch the listener.  Like David's passion in the Psalms, Jars of Clay's music will move you. First purchased this CD in 2009, lent it out, never got returned and it went to out of sight out of mind status. Recently heard the cut Flood on Spotify and knew I had to get this great collection back in my library.  You don't have to be a Christian rock fan to enjoy the talent displayed on these tracks. Play it loud and pray if you need to. I do. If you want a great introduction to contemporary Christian music, I recommend Jars Of Clay.  The instrumentals are so creative and passionate.  I feel like I can listen to this Christian music just like I used to listen to my old rock-n-roll....loud and with the windows open!!!Plus, the lyrics are powerful.  I never thought Christian music could be this cool!  The tune ""The Flood"" I believe I first heard on the radio on a local R&R; station...for years!  It was just recently that I learned Jars of Clay was a Christian band...I'm hooked.  I highly recommend JOC for teens. It's uplifting and yet gets you going.  The music has a great beat that isn't plain at all. Wow, 14 years after its release I came across this gem.  I have something like 600 cd's in my collection - ranging from hard rock, contemporary Christian, bluegrass, roots, and reggae - and this one easily catapulted to my top 10.  What a collection of melodies, lyrics, hooks, message and rhythm! So glad I bought it! My kids sing along to ""the one thing that I know!""  =) I bought this CD because I loved the song &quot;FLOOD&quot;.  It sounded in all radio stations, and it was a really melodic and peaceful song. I think it was exactly what people needed in those years full of funky and  empty songs. But let me tell you that &quot;FLOOD&quot; is not the best  song included in this album. When I listened  &quot;BLIND&quot; for the  first time I got chills all over my body and I almost cryed. Believe me:  listen &quot;BLIND&quot; and you'll know what I'm talking about. You'll be  filled with peace and you'll want to hear it over and over. I remember when &quot;Flood&quot; got its first airplay on the radio in 1995.  Despite the fact that this was the big single, I was not impressed by the song, simply because it wasn't my style (at the time I was primarily  into harder edged music).  But then my little sister came home with the CD  and I got to hear the softer, more melodious compositions like  &quot;He&quot; and &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;.  I liked it.  This album has  great artistic merit on the grounds that it is a beautiful piece of work.  You should know that the lyrics of Jars are sometimes explicitly  Christian.  I don't know your opinion of &quot;Christian music&quot;, but  don't let that label scare you away from enjoying this record.  It's not  &quot;preachy&quot;, nor is it full of the religious vocabulary pervasive  in so much of what comes from the Christian music industry.  Yes, this  album is poetic, but Jars' Christianity is personal and sincere.  I get the  sense that Dan Haseltine (song writer) believes he has a genuine  relationship with God himself.  This relationship just seems to carry over  into the music.  All this to say that the record is worth getting.  Very  sincere and heartfelt.  If you sit and try to understand the lyrics it will  probably get the gears turning in your brain.  Plus you'll get to enjoy the  pleasant music that stretches from the opener to the end of the bonus  track.  I recommend the record. My brother introduced me to Jars of Clay quite some time ago. From start to finish I was amazed with this album. The second verse of the song ""Boy on a String"" has this amazing rhythmic background violin/fiddle. It's one of the most beautiful fill in combinations of sound and rhythm I've ever heard. ----- I highly recommend this album. Each song is carefully constructed to reveal the struggle each of us has in relating our pathetic, self-centered existence to the glory and awesomeness of God.  When I play this CD in my car sometimes I shout for  joy, and other times I cry in confession to God.  This CD will apeal to the  new Christian as well as to the experienced one.  If you love Christian  music, you MUST own this CD. 1995 saw the debut of Jars of Clay with this self-titled release.  Nearly a decade after its release, Jars first album remains their best.  The obvious crowd favorite here is ""Flood"" (and with good reason), which gained airplay on MTV in addition Contemporary Christian and mainstream radio.  Other notable tracks include ""Liquid,"" ""Sinking,"" ""Blind,"" ""Worlds Apart,"" ""Boy on a String"" and ""Love Song for a Savior.""  Jars of Clay is one of the best bands to emerge in the Contemporary Christian Music arena over the last decade, and this album delivers the proof.  I've enjoyed each of the band's releases, but this one is, by far, the best. Jars of Clay's debut album is so good that its one of those albums that you can listen to in its entirety and not skip a track. The album is that good. Dan Haseltine provides strong yet subtle vocals, Greg Howell effectively works his guitar, and Adrian Belew's production ranks among his best. The group implements beautiful additions to their music, like the Gregorian chant in &quot;Liquid&quot;, the violin solo in &quot;Boy on a String&quot;, and the string sections in &quot;Flood&quot; and &quot;Blind&quot;. Besides the two well-known tracks on the album, &quot;Flood&quot; and &quot;Liquid&quot;, every other track is a gem in its lyrics and music. Thankfully the group did not overbear their spiritual message, but kept it simple and sweet. My personal favorite on the album is &quot;He&quot;, an incredibly moving song about finding hope in God in the midst of doubt. Everything just meshed together well on this album, and it remains one of my favorites. A must buy not only for fans of Contemporary Christian music, but for all music listeners. Not since the early days of the ever-searching songwriting of Kerry  Livgren (Kansas) has music commented on the human condition with such  poetic dexterity.  Each song creates a fabric of musical textures and  lyrical ideas which are at once deeply personal and yet globally accesable.  I find the synesthetic aspects vastly appealing - in listening to the  melodies, the lyrics seem to write themselves into the song naturally and  effortlessly - the inverse works as well.  At one point, perhaps the boys  did not write the music at all (part of the point?).  The music is  successfully complex without being complicated, and does not seem to be all  too concerned with authorship over subject.Their name, Jars of Clay,  refers to the fragile nature of us all, another universal commentary on the  human condition and our continued longing for location in the scheme of  life.  Sting has had a quiet yet successful run on this theme for the last  decade.  Jars provide a refreshing new approach to this delicate yet rich  subject. If it were not for the universal appeal of the subject matter, one  could feel embarrased for easedropping on thoughts which seem so  immediatlly personal to the songwriters.It makes me sad that more music  does not attain this level of intricate simplicity.  I only hope that the  members of the band continue to understand that their gift of identifying  the various struggles of the human condition are well worth their efforts,  and that they are greatly appriciated.I had the distinct pleasure of  seening Jars in concert last winter, and I must say that the complexities  of sound typically found only in studio environments was ambiently  projected on stage.  The music, like a true peronal feeling, seems to  travel well. This is by far my favorite JOC album. I actually bought all their cds backwards in chronological order. I love all of them, but the self-titled album is a masterpiece. You know how usually when you buy a cd, there are a couple of songs you can do without and usually skip over? Well there's none like that on this album. Each and every song is superb. I can't think of one thing I'd change. Some might think I'm being too optimistic, but I'm simply stating the facts. I recommend this cd to any, and everyone. God truly shines through on this record. Enjoy! ""Jars of Clay"" is an incredible effort from the quartet with the same name. A mixture of acoustic and Christian rock with a splash of Gregorian Chant provides their sound. It is a good mix, and the songs are great. This album is a testament unto itself, as it has been able to escape the circle of Christian music and make the mainstream in a big way. There have been some good Christian bands that haven't been able to accomplish this feat.The album starts off with one of the two songs produced by Adrian Belew, (one of the geniuses with King Crimson), ""Liquid"". A powerful opening it is only outdone by the other song produced by Belew, ""Flood"". Both use Gregorian Chant to help set the mood, and have a good rhythm and sound to them. ""Liquid"" opens with a little mandolin. ""Flood"" has a good sound to it. The lyrics are quiet over a muted guitar, then it explodes into a crescendo of voices and strumming for the chorus. The counterpoint, as well as the string solo in the middle of the song, makes the song very unique. The other songs do not have the same caliber of sound that these two do, but there are still good nonetheless. ""Sinking"" is another great song, as well as ""Love Song for a Savior"". The first hidden track after the song ""Blind"" ends is a great surprise (around minute 6:00). I don't think that this song should have been hidden like this, as it is up there with the two Belew songs, but it does provide a nice finish to the album.My only complaint about the album is twenty minutes of rehearsal with the strings for the ""Flood"" solo. I still cannot figure out why this much of the studio session made it into the album. At least it is at the very end of the album and you can either listen to the album again, or pop it out of the CD player. Otherwise, this is an excellent piece of work. Excellent CD. The Studio disk is good, the live Disk is incredible. The live version of Worlds Apart is one of my all-time favorite songs--definitely my favorite Jars song. Even now, this is an awesome album. Well worth the purchase. This is one of the great Christian albums.  Musically clever and tasteful, with appealing voices, very fine songwriting, and substantial lyrics (substance and clarity - good things). Maybe I'm getting old, but I tire of  the airy confusion that passes for profound thought with so many artists. Jars of Clay manage to put a bit of spirit into their rock and roll. But the spirit isn't one of deceased loved ones or demons, but of religious enlightenment. This album revolves around the band's Christian beliefs, but never comes off as preachy or judgemental. It includes the hit &quot;Flood&quot; and also covers such topics as child abuse and the manipulation of modern man. Produced with the help of Adrian Belew, this album shines. &quot;Jars of Clay&quot; introduced this album when I was a college junior back in the mid-90s, at a time when I really did not want to hear any of that new Christian music with its alternative, grunge-style, &quot;whacked&quot; sounds (or so I believed them to be).  However, when a friend tossed this CD onto his stereo one evening, the music really just struck something deep down inside me.  It's soft, easy, and very laid-back attitude was just what I needed at a time when school and life were demanding almost too much of me.  And still today, the music is perfect for those times when work and other responsibilities overwhelm me.  I can toss Jars of Clay into my computer, and the soft tones and wonderful lyrics will ease my mind so I can refocus on what I need to do.  This volume is definitely a keeper. This CD is so good that I can still enjoy it even though I'm an atheist. I first listened to this on a church youth trip when I was a kid, and even though I'm no longer a religious person, this is just about the only Christian CD I still have in my library. It's that good. The debut by Jars of Clay is an album that seems to get better the more one listens to it.When I first got it, I really liked a couple of the songs.  As I began listening to it more, I started liking more and more of them.  It is really a CD packed with very good songs.  Some notable standouts include the following:  Flood, Liquid, Sinking, Love Song For a Savior, and Like A Child.This CD has really become a classic.  I consider it a must have for any fan of Christian rock. My favorite Contemporary Christian group...Love Song For A Savior and Flood the best on the cd..but then every song...is worth listening to more then a dozen times..A group that sends the message home about Jesus Christ and His love for the unsaved and saved. God is still reaching out to all those who are seeking...Get alone with this cd...let the words minister to you...Jars of Clay are totally rad!!! This CD has great sound and leaves out the unecissary things like swear words, sex, and violence.  I highly recommend this CD and all of the other Jars of Clay CD's. That says it all.  jars of Clay won a award with this CD.  I enjoyed it a lot and am lookign forward of buying their latest CDs.  Yes, I can recommend them to anybody who like something different, modern but NOT techno sounds! Jars of Clay was one of the first Christian bands I was introduced to as a child, a year or two after this album was released.  While my taste for them grew then because ""Flood"" was the ""hardest"" song I had encountered at that point (and it ROCKED) and I have good memories of listening to the album with my cousins, my love of Jars of Clay and this CD in particular has blossomed because of the richness inherent in this music.Dan Haseltine is a master songwriter, and the profundity of his observations and raw emotion are evident in the sheer beauty that is ""Worlds Apart.""  This song--especially the live version found on the ""Furthermore: From the Studio, From the Stage"" album--has driven me to tears, and that kind of emotion is a rarity for me.What is so phenomenal about this disc, though, is not merely one song or one musical aspect.  It is the fact that every song fits a different mood/emotion/pondering, and yet it still coheres flawlessly as one artistic work.  For me, ""Like a Child"" is the purest embodiment of joy I've ever heard in music; ""Liquid"" the most honest inquiry of Christ's death; ""Art In Me"" the most poignant rendering of the Father's heart.  When combined, these songs depict the whole of the Christian life more deeply and frankly than almost every other piece of art that has tried to touch the topic.More logistically, this is still a fantastic album.  The instrumentation is gorgeous, the beats are solid, and the melodies are catchy without being tired and cliched.Jars of Clay has fulfilled the oft-ignored call of the Christian artist--to not just speak of Christ, but to do so with excellence in every particular. I am a fan of all kinds of music inside or outside of the Christian genre. And this was the time when we had stuff from P.O.D. and my personal favorite Gospel group, Out of Eden. And this had to be the essential choice.There are some Christian bands I don't like that much. I'm not a big Third Day fan in their new stuff.But most of these songs are great. I mean by up there with Project 86. And it's a good thing Flood was a pop crossover. This is even better than Sixpence None The Richer when they crossed over, in which JOC stay more in the Christian subject. I only didn't like #3 and #10. But I kinda like 10, just because of the bonus track. In a period of music where everything sounds the same, it's great to hear a breath of fresh air.  Though Jars of Clay's soaring acoustic melodys and string lines may remind some of Dave Matthews Band, the two are far from being alike.  While DMB is strictly instrumental, Jars embrace such ideas as percussion looping and sampling, including a latin chant which helps to open out the album, along with an intense bass hum.Make no mistake, a new breed of music has arrived:  alterna-folk, if you will.  And if the album seems a bit simplistic at times, it's still wonderful because it's new.And yes, though they have performed on late-night tv and various other prominant places, Jars of Clay is a Christian band.  However, unlike most other bands in that category, Jars is willing to look in depth at the struggles and fears of living the life in a wonderfully metaphoric way.  The song &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; laments &quot;Soaring on the wings of selfish pride/I flew to high/and like Icarus I collide/with a world I try so hard to leave behind.&quot;  Later he cries out &quot;Can I be the one to sacrifice/or grip the spear/and watch the blood and water flow?&quot;  These guys aren't afraid of seeming weak in their faith, instead using these struggles to aid along those who may need the encouragement.All in all, Jars of Clay stand way out in a generation of musical sellouts, and are well worth checking out. I have already written, but I couldn't resist. My name is Samantha and I struggled with the idea of a God and turning all worries to Him. Jars of Clay has some really awesome songs that are meaningful and really made me think about myself and my realationship with Christ. Rock on, Jars, you are an true inspiration.  END Jars of Clay could very well be the most famous of all Alternative CCM bands. And this album is their best yet. The beginnig song, Liquid, is sure to become a favorite among everyone, not just Christian fans, Flood is a personal favorite of mine, and Blind/Four Seven ends the album with a bang, leaving listeners yearning for more. With a lineup like this, it's no wonder that Jars of Clay has become the most popular in their industry. From Christians to Buddhists, everyone will enjoy the sound of Jars of Clay. Even if you're an atheist, you should still pick up this album. That's how good it is. If you know & like Nickel Creek, you'll love this!  Especially if your a Christian!  Awesome!  Great Lyrics, great music, period. at my work i have to make a list of the top christian albums. and this  album by jars of clay will probably be my #1 pick. the songs i like are  &quot;Like a Child&quot;, &quot;Flood&quot;, &quot;Love Song For a  Savior&quot; and &quot;liquid&quot;. the lyrics they write are amazing.  when you listen to this CD you can really feel that they truly love the  Lord and want to serve Him. I was really looking forward to getting this CD, and now that I have it I have to say that I was really disappointed. There are only two really good songs -- &quot;Liquid&quot; and &quot;Flood&quot; -- and everything else is  frankly pretty boring. I wish I had just taped the songs I liked off the  radio and saved my money. Sorry JOC fans! Had to be honest. A friend once asked me this question... &quot;if you could only have one CD what would it be?&quot; it did not take me long to answer &quot;jars of clay-self titled.&quot; Jars of Clay is probably one of my favorite bands, along with caedmon's call, third day, shane barnard, and an indipendant band Robbie Seay Band. Jars of clay has the most orginal sound of any of these, and this CD is the best illustration of that. I can listen to this CD over and over again and never once skip a track or get tired of it. Love song for a Savior is beautiful, Flood is a classic, and my favorite song ever, and quite possibly the most underrated song this whole album, Worlds Apart. Like i said, if you can only have one CD, this is the one to go with.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Rock & Alternative,Pop,Adult Alternative,Rock",say wow every great listen biginning end cant pick favorit love much love savyor worlds apart beautiful boy string liquid like child realy great beat arent noise like youve got get cd worth ten times costes first got touch jars clay downloading quot love savior quot whim promptly bought soon reasoning comparatively example impulse buying id heard true rest would worth money quite right one better examples christian rock rock general late th early st centuries pop hooks take residence memory dont go away still glorious vocal harmonies even without brin say wow great listen end pick love love worlds apart beautiful boy string liquid child great beat noise got cd worth times costes got touch jars clay downloading quot love savior quot whim promptly bought soon reasoning comparatively example impulse impulse buying buying heard true rest worth money quite right better examples christian christian rock rock rock rock rock general late early centuries pop hooks residence memory dont go away go away away glorious vocal vocal harmonies harmonies
215,435,B00000053G,"Old school Mystical goes hard! I used to bump this back in the day. This is a must have for your cd collection. Maybe it's because I performed all the guitar, bass, keyboards / piano, fender rhodes and hammond organ on this CD but I will always swear this is Mike's (Mystikal) best CD ever. I wrote and performed most of the music you hear played on every song. If u remember, in &quot;Yall Aint Ready Yet&quot; he says,&quot;Dave, play that funky guitar!!&quot; Well, that's me. David &quot;D. Funk&quot; Faulk. For more info on me, Mystikal and more, check out my website at [...] for a complete discography. I still do the hottest tracks down south so come get some! Peace everyone!- David &quot;D. Funk&quot; Faulk This album is awesome.  It is still one of my favorite albums ever. Almost 8 years old and still hype as anything else out there.  Mystikal's other album's have yet to match the intensity of this one.  I have personally bought this album 5 times(b/c of scratches etc...) I recommend this to anyone .  Go buy it now!!! Mystikal set up shop with his unorthodox style and flow on this groundbreaking debut.  In 1995 Mystikals style was unlike any other in the rap game.  His cadence, use of swift tongue twisting flow, voice variations etc etc etc. made him an instant superstar.  His first hit, Here I Go, was THE hardest song when it dropped.  I don't care what you say, That song is probably one of THE Hardest songs, if not the Hardest song, to ever come out of the south.  This is a real battle track dedicated to who ever wanted to test.With lines like: ""You wanna battle bring a body bag, I'm gonna need it to carry yo STUPID A$$"",`Ill [mess] you up with the quickness!"",`you can bring yo whole posse punk I still wont lose, Ill stomp your whole staff, must want a bloodbath!"",""you wanna fight [punk] put em up, how that sound? Come get knocked down!""This is just a non-stop lyrical assault delivered with unparalleled aggressiveness and poise.  Definitely a classic track.Just because that song is so great doesn't mean the rest of the album is weak.  Mystikal drops some unforgettable quotables and choruses on this album.  His technique is that straight fire.  Delivering confident lines like ""I know yall [people] can't [mess] with me because I can't [mess] with my damn self!"" and  ""The only way to keep my Mfing name out your Mfing mouth is to keep yo Mfing mouth shut!"", Mystikal couldn't possibly be stopped.Every single song on here is the joint but my favorites include Yall Aint Ready Yet, Mr. Hood Critic, Not That Nicca remix, I'm, Here I Go, and Beware.  The beats are off the chain and perfectly compliment Mystikals style.  Overall you should make every effort to hear this album.  It is definitely a classic album that is nearly untouchable.  This is a diamond in the rough.  EXTREMELY recommended. This mystikal album ain't nuthin' like the rest of his albums.  In this album, he doesn't scream as much and he he raps decently fast. His flows are more layed back in this one.  Like, in the song, ""murderer"" he starts off real layed back and slow with ""muthaf**kin' murderah, shot my f**kin' brotha."" Then loud and mad soundin' with ""BUT WHEN I FIND HIM I'M A GET THAT MUTHAF**KA!!!"" This is by far the best mystikal album ever.  I haven't found it in any stores lately, though so you might want to get it soon. This album is awesome! The best songs are ""Ya'll Ain't Ready Yet"", ""Beware"", ""Mr. Hood Critic"", ""I'm"", ""Out That Boot Camp Clicc"", ""Here I Go"" & ""Ya'll Ain't Ready Yet (Remix)"". This album is definately worth getting. The Michael Jordan of rap music - that's Mystikal.Jordan's Championship winning, legend sealing shot at the buzzer in Utah - that's the CD Mind of Mystikal.Revisiting this CD is especially important in today's rap landscape - a barren lot of $25 beats and 4-word lyrics repeated over and over and over and over...and over. In this sense, rap music is a lot like basketball: any fool can walk onto the court and sink a free throw or lay-up, but it's a rare few that can make people pay to tune in for magic. Less than one minute into Mind it becomes obvious, this is NBA All-Star material.First let's talk about the music. Yes, the music was written. It's original, urgent and intense with deep groove and undertow. These sounds have identities. They are not simply club ""bump"" to spit a few lines over. If this CD were recorded without vocals at all, it would still get the point across in a damn scary way.As for the spittin' skillz, no one even approaches Mystikal. Rapid and timely changes in inflection, tone, pace, volume and style make good lyrics sound great and force the listener to pay close attention. The NOLA native's flow is well annunciated and sometimes so fast that you can't rap along, even when you know the lines! (Try the ""Tina Marie at Tipitina's"" line from ""Y'all Ain't Ready Yet."") Picking out the pop culture references is fun to. Nearly every track is a gangsta classic and even the remixes stand strong by themselves. Check it, if you're ready. (Mark Beneventi, LIT Monthly Magazine) You know that question, 'Which CD would you bring to a deserted island?'? Well, this CD would be the one. I've been listening to this album for years, and it never gets old. With it's local New Orleans vibe, and a unique voice (that matches Precise's production perfectly), this can be played any time, anywhere.This is the definition of New Orleans rap. Forget Cash Money, No Limit, Mobo, etc. Big Boy was the most flavorful, and diverse.If you're in the market for some Mystikal music, pick this album up, and you'll be straight. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT MICHAEL TYLER IS THE TRUE &quot;BLACK PRINCE OV DA SOUTH&quot;. HE IS A TRUE PIONEER OF SOUTHERN RAP. HE ALSO HAS A STYLE OF HIS OWN AND CAN'T TOO MANY BITE HIM. TRUE ENOUGH YOU HAVE THUG ADDICT FROM BALLIN'RECORDS.STILL I KNEW THE DIFFERENCE WHEN I HEARD HIM. EVEN THOUGH UNLV TRIED TO DIS,HE STILL LET 'EM KNOW &quot;HERE I GO&quot;. SO FOR ALL YA'LL SLEEPIN' ON MIKE YA'LL BETTER GET ALL OF HIS ALBUMS CAUSE THEY SUPA BUMPIN'AND OFF DA NARLI FA SHARLI. I first heard this album back in April of 1995,and it was a turning point for me in hip hop. I still have the original big boy release cassette today. Back then, the original album had eight songs including the remix for not that ni**a, and the re-release with jive had six new tracks. This was the best produced album by Precise. It's definitely the doggystyle or the chronic or enter the wu tang 36 chambers of New Orleans. Don't forget to check out the other classics including G Slimm's fours deuces and trays, Insane's camp for life, Black Meance's really doe and drama time, Fiend's i won't be denied, etc. These albums speak for themselves. Peace!!! Im from Westbank New Orleans (Harvey) so this album was pretty big around there. This is by far Mystikal's best album. His flow is fast, slow, loud, and soft...he keeps it fresh, changing up his flow throughout the song. The beats are so shyve, much better than P's stuff when he went to No Limit. From the dark beats of Murderer and Mind of Mystikal to the flava of Yall aint ready yet and Here I go, Mystikal never ceases to impress me. This album was made when he was on the top of his game, and his album shows it. 10/10. Before Mystikal became mundane he was putting out southern rap classics like this album. When you listen to Y'all Aint Ready Yet and Here I Go you can tell that Mystikal put effort into his raps and wasnt going through the motions like he does now. Out That Boot Camp Clicc remains as one of my favorite tracks from Mystikal. As for flaws, there are none. This album was Mystikal at his best. I really think he messed up when he decided to go commercial and put out lackluster material(four albums later). Bottom Line: Mind Of Mystikal is one of the best releases in 1995 and is Mystikal's best album. The production was cool and Mystikal was hungry as hell back then. Standout Tracks: YALL AINT READY YET(original and remix), MURDERER, BEWARE, I'M, HERE I GO, OUT THAT BOOT CAMP CLICC, MIND OF MYSTIKAL, NOT THAT N****, NEVER GONE BOUNCE(The Dream). Mystikal is definitely at his best on this album nowadays Kal ain't all that and of course with his rape charges i guess he put out the greatest hits to get some kind of an appeal goin(haha) yea thats kinda wrong but hey its the truth i guess but this album along with ""Unpredictable"" and ""Ghetto Fabulous"" are his absolute best works I have all 3 and still bump every one of them definitely worth your money Pick it up. I cant get enough of this CD. I actually hadnt start listening until 2004 beacuse for some reason I thought it was gonna be wack.But I should have known better after hearing HERE I GO which put MR MIKE TYLER on.for 6 years this album has been in constant rotation on my MP3 player. THIS ALBUM WAS THE STR8EST ALBUM OUT THAT TIME ALL THE SONG WAS GO BUT THE BEST IS HERE I GO THE BEAT IS ONE OF THE PHATEST BEAT OUT ANDTHIS ALBUM WAS PURE GANSTR RAP IF U DONT HAVE IT BUY IT MUST HAVE 1995, New Orleans' Mystikal gets his chance to shine.  This album is a far cry from his ""Shake Ya A--"" joint from 2000 or Tarantula album from 2001 (which I have, and is a fun and funny commercial album); this album is definitely gangsta and has an underground feel to it.  Mystikal has a unique and original flow and at times, gives off an angry vibe.  I do not know much about his rape charges from a few years ago, and some may let that color their opinions about him (people make mistakes), but that cannot take away from the quality of this album since the two have nathan to do with each other.  Beats are simply fantastic southern fried funk and crunk.  ""Precise"" Edwards produces these phat beats.  ""Y'all Ain't Ready Yet"" has a dope N'Awlins jazzy, deep bass beat.  He shuts down marks with funny punchlines and has a humorous bragadoccio.  ""Murderer"" is whiny and rattly crunk-meets-G-Funk, and is lyrically menacing.  He is angry about his sister, Michele Tyler being killed and wants revenge.  The hook is angry with him moaning ""Cops murder n----z at night.""  ""Mr. Hood Critic"" is melodic G-Funk with Mystikal calling out haters and how he won't let them get him down.  The beat is relaxed and sweet, while Mystikal spits hard and fast.  Mystikal also goes hard on the crunk inflected ""Not That N---a.""  I like the scratches on ""I'M"" and the fast adrenaline rush paced beat, another crunk banger.  See, the crunk from this period was different than now; now, it is over commercialized, but stuff like this is fun and exciting.  I am relatively new to the sub-genre.  I used to only look at as club mainstream crap like it often is now (not always though- think new 3-6 or UGK).  Mystikal flows over the beats with ease.  He can rap fast over the slower beats as effective as he can over the fast ones.  This album establishes him as a force in the rap game.  I never heard Unpredictable or Ghetto Fabulous off of No Limit/Jive, but I hear they are good too.  This is a must-have classic. Whoa now, Heard this back when it first came out and I still bump it from time to time nowadays. Free Mystikal This Cd had it all. It had the lyric of Mystical and  Beats. This cd is cooler than a fan. There was nothing better before it and nothing better after. When it comes to hot tracks this cd is the&quot;Alpha and  Omega&quot; of Rap. People know Mystikal can rap,and that's something that makes LET'S GET READY and TARANTULA tight,but people forget before he was &quot;bouncin' back&quot; and makin' chicks &quot;shake it fast&quot;,Mystikal was tellin' people they &quot;ain't ready yet&quot;.MIND OF MYSTIKAL made people notice he wasn't a come-n-go rapper,which he prove a lot through this c.d.Every track is tight(in some cases lyrically and comically).If you heard this c.d,you know it's tight.If not,then you missin' out. This is talent! Mystikal has a very original and creative rapping style that is humorous and fun to listen to. He varies his tempo, his volume, and his flow while rapping, making this a very entertaining listen. Mystikal is also a very fast rapper and a great lyricist. In one song, he raps about his morning routine where he uses the bathroom, takes a shower, etc. and continues on.The songs are also pretty long, the average at about 4-5 minutes, and there are no interludes or intros. or anything like that on this album. Every track is actually a song.The beats and the music are your typical rap-type music, but it's done well and isn't 100% repetitive like most rap music you'll hear nowadays. The music will vary a little bit so it isn't boring, and the production and quality of this album is actually pretty good, despite what some reviewers elsewhere have said.Mystikal has a very impressive debut. Be careful, though. Sometimes it's hard to understand him when he raps really fast, but he's still very impressive.","Pop Rap,Soul,Pop,R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Southern Rap,Gangsta & Hardcore,Blues",old school mystical goes hard used bump back day must cd collection maybe performed guitar bass keyboards piano fender rhodes hammond organ cd always swear mikes mystikal best cd ever wrote performed hear played every u remember quot yall aint ready yet quot says quot dave play funky guitar quot well thats david quot funk quot faulk info mystikal check website complete discography still hottest south come get peace everyone david quot funk quot faulk awesome still one favorite ever almost years old still hype anything else mystikals yet match intensity one personally bought times b c scratches etc recommend anyone go buy mystikal set shop old old school school mystical hard used bump day cd collection maybe performed guitar guitar bass bass keyboards piano fender fender rhodes hammond organ organ cd swear mikes best cd wrote performed hear played remember quot yall aint ready says quot play funky guitar quot quot funk quot info check website complete complete discography discography south come peace quot funk quot awesome favorite years old hype match intensity personally bought times scratches recommend buy set shop
216,436,B00000053K,"Spice 1 dropped this fourth album, 1990-Sick, on Jive Records back in late 1995/early '96, after coming off such a greatAmeriKKKa's Nightmare. If I remember correctly, I read that either he was locked up when this album was released, or he was released from jail before this album came out (due to overcrowding). Spice 1 has been one of the greatest from the bay since the early 90's with187 He Wroteand hisself titleddebut on Jive in '92. His fourth album takes you down the life of Spice once again, a road that many of his fans (such as myself) were very familiar with.To get straight to the point in this review, the concept is average, and Spice 1's lyrics rarely breaks any new ground with this album. Pretty much that he doesn't say anything new than he did on his earlier albums (his later albums after this will suffer the same problems too). The production here is decent, but some of the beats are kind of dry, and are missing that sound that other Bay Area rappers had back then (see Too $hort'sCocktails, or LunizOperation Stackola). To be fair, he always threw a twist into his rhyme style that many others lacked, which separated him from other rappers from his region.There are a few good tracks that are worth listening to. The album's title track features MC Eiht, and works in their favor (the last track is a Spice-1 solo). ""1-800-Straight-from-the-pen"" Spice talks about his life, and his friends in the jail yard, and has a catchy hook ""They dialing 1-800-C-O-L-L-E-C-T/ straight from the state penitentiary"". Following that song is ""Ain't No Love"" which sounds pretty deep. Those are the only few tracks I can think of that stood out. Most tracks that were unnamed were not good, or not good enough to stand out. ""Sucka A** N****z"" is good as Spice-1, G-Nut, and X-tra Large play Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay.The overall result of this album was really not that good. It's pretty average in my opinion, and most of his albums (especially on Jive) after this have the same problem of redundancy and blandness. Spice really doesn't say anything new on this album, but there are a few good tracks that are worth checking out. Spice 1 might be 1990-Sick, but I think he's loosing his ""187 Pureness"" (thank you Source Magazine...they never explain their ratings). Looks like this album just went out of print. If you decide to buy this album, definitely get it used. If you want to hear Spice at his best, buy every album he's made before this one.

It's a shame he didn't get no airplay over here on the east coast cause he'd have definitely gone multi-platinum as he deserves to do.

For a man at this point in his career to do that was a feet. I don't know what he was smokin or who pist him off but he was enraged on this album. The beats on most songs are darker than any in his career. He was focused more on death. The production took a step up. The intro to the album says it all. Killem all because everybody dyin on this mf'n album. I miss real gangsta rap. Also check out Phantom of the Rapra by Bushwick Bill good stuff. Wow whar a great cd. One of my 20 fafoutites cd I ever heard. Freddy Chico Spice weezy bomb music. This 1996 the platinum era of the bestr rap. The best song are CAN U FEEL IT & E-40, Surivival, Tales of the Niggas Who Got Crept On, 1-800 straight From the Pen. This is in my opinion the last great lp from Spice 1. the rest who dropp after 1996 is worst. But in my opinion 2 best spice records, I don't known who is the best is Amerikkazz Nightmare and 1999-Sick and the thierd is 187 He wrote also classizzzzzz. Muisic is great funky bass synh programing, and lyric Spice is also great, This is hardcore so this cd is not for everyone. This cd is fot thung man and gangztazzz and killers.

Peace from Warsaw Praga Poudnie Groch&oacute;w side Even in Poland Spice 1 have got some tru fans. As I said in my review title, this album is mad slept on, even (or especially) by his fans. I would argue that his EP(Let It Be Known) and first 5 albums (Spice 1, 187 He Wrote, Amerikkka's Nightmare, 1990-Sick & Tha Black Bossalini) are classic, essential pieces of west coast hip hop and hip hop in general. But this album holds a special place in my CD catalogue. Arguably his best album, 1994's ""Amerikkka's Nightmare, was obviously going to be a hard act to follow. With that said, Spice didn't disappoint.1990-Sick isn't going to attrack as many outsiders as his previous album did with guest appearances from 2Pac & Method Man, along with the graphic, yet very catchy ""Strap on the Side"". But it should be more than pleasing to his fans, including myself. It may be his most gritty, undergound sounding album next to 187 He Wrote.Spice 1 managed to put out quality albums up until about 2002's Spiceberg Slim. Everything after that suffers from mediocre production. Don't get me wrong, Spice can still deliver on the mic, but his last 6 or 7 albums and compilations leave much to be desired in regards to production.This album being nearly in the middle of his quality run, you get an album with dope, funky production and Spice 1 just as hard as ever and a little more mature, musically and mentally. While the 4 (solo) albums that follow 1990-Sick are nothing to complain about, this is the last Spice 1 album with that signature Spice 1 production that is instrumental in making a Spice 1 album really feel like a Spice 1 album.BEST SONGS:1990-Sick (Kill 'Em All) Feat. MC EIHTDirty BayDrama1-800 (Straight From The Pen)Ain't No LoveFunky Chickens Spice delivers another classic for his fourth effort (and it's one of his top 3 albums). It has 15 songs, of which 4 are classics, 2 are near classics, 6 are good, 2 are ok, and 1 I skip. Guests are few and production is great. Produced by Blackjack (4 songs), Chase & Bosko (3 songs each), Ant Banks and Payback (2 songs each). It's a shame he didn't get no airplay over here on the east coast cause he'd have definitely gone multi-platinum as he deserves to do. Even though I'm used to Southern Cali rappers from MC Eiht to Ice Cube to CJ Mac, Spice did it with 1990-Sick to put the Bay on the map of gangsta rap.  The song 1990-Sick(Kill' Em All) featuring MC Eiht is a strong & heavy  Thug'sta song about haulicinations, Dirty Bay is a hard classic delivered by Dr.Bomb from da Bay, Sucka Ass Nigga featuring G-Nut is a hard Ice-T like hard hitter, and of course Spice has a horrorcore song called Snitch Killas that sounds like something of the Geto Boys or Ice Cube, this is Spice's #1 Album!Freddy Chico's best are *1(featuring MC Eiht), *2, 3, 4(featuring Kokane), 5, 6, 7, *8(featuring G-Nut), 9, 10, 11, 12, *13, 14(featuring E-40) & 15. Spice made 1 decent album after this, blackbossalini, then it went down hill from there! Spice was probaly my fave rapper in tha 90s, even better then pac in his prime! hardcore spice fans need this album, cop everything b4 this , cop blackbossalini, and thats it, spice 1 kicked a*s in tha 90s ! no doubt 1995, Spice 1 records another classic.  Dude ruled the 1990's.  He is a gangster rapper with a unique personality and dope killa flow.  This album has a neat array of hot headed psycho imagery over neat mobbin' backdrops.  The production ranges from Mobb Music (common in the bay in the mid 90's, to psycho funk, old-school sampling, and G-Funk.  The producers range from Blackjack, Chase, Clinton ""Payback"" Sands, Bosko, to the great Ant Banks.  The original ""1990-Sick (Kill 'Em All)"" is a straight gangsta rap with MC Eiht, and Spice's flows are relentless.  This joint is representative of the great collaboration power between the 2 homies, and the chemistry is perfect.  The beat is melodic Mobb Music with a faint whiny synth.  I also love ""Dirty Bay"" with the twangy, menacing beat.  The song samples the whistles from Otis redding's ""Sittin' On The Dock Of The Bay;"" this joint is an awesome grimy bay anthem.  ""Mind Of A Sick N---a"" is crazy good.  The beat samples a pattern of Whodini's ""Friends;"" and the beat has a crazy psycho whiny synth; lyrically, this song is what it is, mainy!  ""1 800 (Straight From The Pen"" has an awesome, more relaxed G-Funk beat, reminiscing on a cuddy in lockdown.  Another relaxed G-Funker is ""Ain't No Love.""  This one is a sweet keyboard, and again displays Spice's lyrical wordplay, and he drops some deeper knowledge.  One thing, Spice keeps it real throughout this album, and it is why he consistently gets positive reviews.  A fun track is ""Funky Chickens.""  The beat is some nice lowrider G-Funk, similar in style to L.A. rap beatwise.  He drops some spits about the drug trade.  This album has no filler, in my opinion, and is another classic in his extensive catalog.  If you from Cali, or like west coast rap, this one is essential. This is a good cd for real SPICE 1 fans. The best tracks are &#34;snitch killa&#34;  &#34;1-800-collect&#34; &#34;aint no luv&#34; and &#34;mobbin' &#34;","Gangsta & Hardcore,Pop Rap,Rap & Hip-Hop,West Coast,Pop",spice dropped fourth sick jive records back late early coming greatamerikkkas nightmare remember correctly read either locked released released jail came due overcrowding spice one greatest bay since early wroteand hisself titleddebut jive fourth takes life spice road many fans familiar get straight point review concept average spice lyrics rarely breaks new ground pretty much doesnt say anything new earlier later suffer problems production decent beats kind dry missing sound bay area rappers back see hortscocktails lunizoperation stackola fair h spice spice dropped dropped fourth sick jive jive records records late early coming nightmare remember correctly read locked released released jail came overcrowding spice spice one greatest bay early jive fourth life spice road fans familiar straight straight point point review concept average spice lyrics rarely breaks new ground pretty pretty much say new earlier later suffer problems production decent beats kind dry missing sound bay bay area bay area rappers area rappers see fair
217,437,B00000053T,"This album is highly underated although that their 3 albums are better.The production is alright.Crew,phony rappers,the hop,1nce again and world play are the best I've been told from many sources that this album and the love movement were produced nearly 98% percent by Dilla. With another 2% of it overseen and executive produced by Tip and Ali. It Makes perfect sense because it sounds nothing like the first 3 albums. And if you know your production at all, this sounds like 100% Dilla, and if you can't hear him, I judge your knowledge of rap production. The drums are unmistakable, and the background ambience and detail is exactly the sounds that he utilized to re-define hip hop in the late 90's and early 00's. Listen to this, then to Commons LWFC, His tracks with the roots, and his other stones throw productions. Unmistakeable if you ask me, and the sooner you figure this out, the sooner you realize how much of a genius Tip was for discovering this cat and giving him the full creative power to do what he does best, and how much of a time capsule this album really is. BTW, did I mention the rhymes are incredible? For whatever reason this album tends to recieve some hate for reasons i cant understand....Maybe cuz ATCQ raised the bar so high from their first 3 albums that this couldn't possibly live up to their ultra high expectations....Personally, i think this album is classic bc the beats,rhymes, and content are all on point....This album definately is an album you can zone out to or nod your head to...There's no cuts on here that will bang in the club or blast out your speakers...But IMO Tribe is doing what they do best on this album.....Putting together a very cohesive album w/ a perfect vibe to fit the beats....""phony rappers"" is a great start and ""Get A Hold"" is the stand out track...I think ""get a hold"" might be one of their greatest songs ever put out....The rest of the album blends in perfectly....""Word Play"" is another stand-out track that is very witty and dope.....The final cut ""stressed out"" features Faith Hill on the chorous....This a great song to end the album, there are some very introspective thought and rhymes on this song that makes it easy to zone out to...I think every fan of hip hop should own this classic..1 If your looking for raw hip hop, look no further.  I just chose this albumn because it's my favorite of theirs, but you couldn't go wrong purchasing any Tribe albumn. Essentials for any hip hop aficionado. This was one of the first hip-hop albums I heard, and it got me hooked. Every track excells in every area. Tribe was in a class all its own, so we can only compare it to its other works. In my opinion, this album is their second best work, with Midnight Marauders being the best. However its almost a photo finish. If you like hip-hop, you have to have this album. Just a note, if you've only heard QTip's solo stuff, try to not think about it when you buy this album. QTip, in his solo career, is a disgrace. All his ability to flow, and rap lyrics that made sense went out the window when he left Tribe. But in the tribe days, both Phife and Tip were the best in the business. In every track they'll WOW you with their flows, rhymes and what they actually say.The best tracks (all of them are really good) are: Jam, Motivators, Mind Power, Seperate/Together, 1nce Again, The Hop, and Stressed Out. This album is absolutely ridiculous from beginning to finish. The beats are the best beats comprised on any Hip-hop album with constant consistency. Flawless production in my opinion probably equaling Camp Lo's Up town saturday night as my favorite ever. Tip is as tight as ever with his execution and delivery along with Phife and cons to the quence who is introduced into the mathematics.In my opinion one of the best produced albums in Hip-Hop history unmissable. Shame they could not continue the track for track consistency in the Love Movement. PURCHASE THIS !!!!!!! When you are a hip hop fan you must have heared about a tribe called quest. I heared of it but never listened to it untill three weeks ago. A friend of my gave me the album to borrow it and I must say that I like it a lot. It is very relaxed and the beats are cool. I can't compare it with other albums of a tribe called quest,because I don not know them, but they must be good to. On this album there is not one number I want to skip and I think that must say a lot. Q-Tip was best in the middle of the Tribe's career.  Before Midnight Marauders and after this album, his lyrical muscles were just too weak for his image as the Abstract Poetic.  This album attempts to supersede the impossibly high level of balanced perfection that Midnight Marauders presented to the world.  They add mini tracks (Crew, Separate/Together) and try to attack the mainstream directly (many conscious rappers don't know that conscious rap only works when it doesn't keep talking about how conscious it is).  They try to embrace the party world (Jam, the Hop) and the cerebral world (Mind Power) and flirt with less conventional song forms (Word Play).  This is all well and good, except for Consequence (where the hell did he come from?) and Stressed Out, which can be omitted from the album with no trouble at all.The production on this album strikes an excellent balance, and the overall pace of the album is even more deliberately measured than that of Midnight, which was almost a fluke of a perfect album.  There are discordant keyboards on joints like Phony Rappers and Separate/Together, then the tight jams of the horribly underrated Get a Hold and the hint of what is yet to come, Keeping it Moving.  Most of the songs retain a crucial jazz element of the earlier work combined with a hint of the futuristic sterility of the Love Movement, but this middle ground, combined with the unhurried brilliance of the lyrical work, makes it my favorite tribe album.Instead of being a great rap album like the one before it, Beats Rhymes and Life is a great Tribe album.  It takes time to understand it but it fits perfectly in its place in the Tribe canon and in the mid 90s, when hip hop was just about to start killing itself. A Tribe Called Quest - The most innovative hip-hop group of the 90s, hands down. Beats, Rhymes &amp; Life isn't the most highly regarded of Tribe albums, but it's still definitely worth hearing, as is the whole ATCQ catalogue. Here are my thoughts on the tracks of this album.1. Phony Rappers (3:35) - A sweet track about Q-Tip and Phife throwing it down on the streets for a few nonbelievers. The clever rhymes and a thick, fuzzy bassline provide for an excellent opener.2. Get A Hold (3:56) - This is a dark, bassed out track that's not as good as Phony Rappers. I could take or leave this one.3. Motivators (3:20) - A great song. Phife describes it much better than I ever could- &quot;This hear groove was made for vintage freestylin'/feelin like I'm chillin' on the Caribbean Islands.&quot;4. Jam (4:38) - This is one of my favorite tracks of the album. It's the perfect song to put on when you're done with school or work for the week and you just want to bust out for the weekend. Good stuff.5. Crew (1:58) - Greatly divergent from Jam, Crew is a frustrated song laced with a dark, cloudy organ and a diatribe from Tip.6. The Pressure (3:02) - Yet another gloomy song, but it's much better than Crew. There is some kickin' scratching/sampling in the beginning that pumps me up.7. 1nce Again (3:49) - A smooth number with some nice female vocals and a wicked bassline.8. Mind Power (3:55) - Tip sums this one up perfectly in the opening seconds of the song...&quot;Mmmmm, so funky.&quot;9. The Hop (3:27) - The Hop is a flowing, jazzy song with a  catchy refrain that will make you do the hop.10. Keeping It Moving (3:38) - This is my other favorite of the album. This track is ridiculously tight. There's some fine jazz guitar along with spectacular rhymes that will be stuck in your head for weeks.11. Baby Phife's Return (3:18) - This one is all Phifey and he throws down as usual, but the beat is pretty weird and dissonant. Not bad.12. Seperate/Together (1:38) - A short song featuring Tip, a nice beat and some wacky organ sounds.13. What Really Goes On (3:23) - Some nice horns and rhymes, but there's something missing in What Really Goes On. It sounds pretty half-hearted to me.14. Word Play - Nice word play with a dizzy, late-night love groove. Good tune.15. Stressed Out - I don't like this song. I think Faith Evans' appearance is unnecessary and the groove isn't really tight at all. In my opinion, this is a poor closer.My descriptions en masse may not appear to make this record worthy of 4 stars, but The Tribe has many intangibles that are difficult to describe, and, as with every other Tribe album, the rhymes are all on point. For A Tribe Called Quest fans and hip-hop fans in general, this is a worthy purchase. This is an excellent album to listen to when you're in your car for an extended amount of time and you can listen to the whole thing at once.  While the album actually has 16 tracks, all of them put together sound like one really long song.  There are no tracks that particularly stand out, which in this case is a good thing.  They all complement each other and blend together better than any album I've ever heard.In typical Tribe Called Quest style, the beats are nice and mellow.  There's enough for you to keep your head bobbing, but nothing that will elevate your blood pressure.  The lyrics are all fairly random.  You can tell that these rappers didn't really have a plan when they went into the studio to record this album.  They just put on some beats and started flowing.  That's the way rap should be recorded.I've always wondered why Tribe was never really played on the radio when they were in their prime, but then I figured it out after listening to Beats Rhymes &amp; Life.  Most artists put out CDs with one or two songs that are good enough for radio air time, and the rest of the songs are usually just filler material.  To someone who doesn't appreciate Tribe, ALL of the songs on this CD can be construed as filler material.  That's probably the reason why Tribe was always respected as great artists by their peers, but never embraced by the masses.  Nevertheless, this is a great album that I recommend. This is a really great album and probably one of the best by A Tribe Called Quest. It has their trademark smooth style and flow with a much darker theme and subject matter than their previous album. It's probably their darkest album lyrically and thematically. Definitely a great buy. They shipped this cd extremly fast it got here before it was even supposed to.No complaints what so ever Look forward to more purcheses. This album is definitely on par with the 3 previous classics from one if not the greatest rap group of all time.  This album sounds like Tribe from the future. It''s an evolution from their Native Tongue days.  Jay Dee's (RIP ,a musical genius) fingerprints are all over this album, most notably on the extra crispy drum programming and the cutting and pasting of voice samples.  Consequence adds another flavor to MC mix and more than holds his own with the 2 Linden Blvd legends.  I'm glad Kanye snatched Conse out of the bargain bin to give him another chance to shine.  And lastly Q tip and Phife are as sharp as ever in tandem and solo.  It's sad they broke up on such a subpar album (The Love Movement).  This album lives up to it's title.  Tight beats, ill rhymes a plenty, and a slice of life during the East Coast, West Coast beef of the 90's.  Cop this album if you haven't already This album is TIGHT.  Don't believe all the hip-hop historians that are dismissive of this record.  I've always felt that Tribe had 4 classic albums: People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, The Low End Theory, Midnight Marauders AND Beats, Rhymes and Life.  I always hated ""Stressed Out"".  Besides that this joint is CORRECT.  Critics often try to front like this album has little redeeming value.  ""The Hop""?  ""Wordplay""?  These tracks are ILL.  Phife came harder on ""The Hop"" than he did on any other ATCQ track ever!  Don't believe the hype!  This album is a slept on CLASSIC!!! I would have given this album 2 1/2 stars in 1996, and been happy about it. I remember it vividly. It was July, and I was jonesing for the Quest to follow up to their masterpiece ""Midnight Marauders"" released a little less than three years earlier. I stepped into the store on cloud 9, and returned home as quickly as I could to pop this in......and what I got was about an hour of disappointment. I just wasn't prepared for this kind of shift. This album was nowhere near as beautiful as any of their previous work. I held them to such a high standard, that anything less than astonishment was unacceptable. This was a dense, nuanced album, that showed that the mid 90's Quest was not the early 90's Quest. It's bass heavy, linear production resembles some of the things to come a few years later from second wave alterna-rap juggernauts, The Roots, and Common.This may not be their best, but it's still an excellent album. The wordplay between Phife, and Q-Tip was still almost telepathic, and while the feel of easiness was gone, song to song was not a difficult listen. There was also extremely pure reminders of why Quest was so loved in the first place (ie ""The Jam"", and ""1nce Again"") Those songs rank among the best of anything in their catalog. Songs like: ""Phony Rappers""(an excellent battle rap) ""Get A Hold"", ""Motivators"", ""What Really Goes On, and ""Word Play"" represent some of the best work in their post-peak period. This album also showcases some of the best work of The Ummah production unit, which consisted of Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and Jay-Dee.The album closes with ""Stressed Out"" a surprising collaboration with Faith Evans that doesn't elate or disappoint (the album version would later be outdone by an excellent maxi featuring remixes by Bjork, and so on). What's so surprising, is that so many artists used this album as a semi-blueprint, slightly tweaking it's formulas, and applying them to their sound. ""Beats, Rhymes, and Life"" almost had the same impact on late 90's hip hop as ""The Low End Theory"" had on early 90's hip hop, which really says something about this record. The truth is, this record should probably have been released 3 years later minus a song or two. This record's successor ""The Love Movement"" was a direct reaction to the reception this record was given. The ironic thing is, it's predecessor holds up better 10 years out. Tribe's fourth LP may not be as great as their first three but it's still on another level compared to the rest.. This album is a little darker than their first three albums  but it's still great.. I also like the mix they  have at the beginning of track 6  TRIBE fans pick this up A Tribe Called Quest's (Q-Tip, Phife, Ali Shaheed Muhammad) fourth album was ""Beats, Rhymes & Life"" (1996). Following the release of three albums I consider classics ATCQ dropped this solid fifteen-track release after a three-year hiatus. Jay Dee (R.I.P.) teamed up with Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhamammad for ""The Ummah"" and helped with production on this release. My favourite track on this one is ""Stressed Out"", ATCQ and Faith Evans collaborate for an outstanding track. Faith Evans really impressed me on this cut, her soulful singing is excellent. Backed by some sick production ATCQ shine on cuts like ""Jam"", ""1nce Again"" and ""What Really Goes On"". Overall their is a notable change in production (more hard, less upbeat) and lyrics, less Jazz oriented cuts (the type I love), and more serious lyrics in my opinion. I don't consider ""Beats, Rhymes & Life"" to be among ATCQ's best work, it does however have some memorable moments, and some impressive production, which makes it a keeper for any big ATCQ fan. A Tribe Called Quest 1988-1998. When I first copped this, I put it in my system at home and listened to it mostly subconsciously while doing other things. At first, I was very dissappointed at what I had heard and angry about how this was so different than their three predecessors. It would be a while before I played it again.The next time I popped ""B,R, & L"" in was in my car, thinking it needed a second chance. Before I was halfway through the disc I started feeling it. And soon I was really feeling it. At first I was unsatisfied with the more prevalent swearing and very laid-back beats and flows, but once I started understanding their approach I played this like it was brand new. I still found time to listen to it throughout the next couple of months in which I bought many new cd's.I should say that this is tied as my second favorite Tribe album with ""Low End Theory"" and behind their first masterpiece (""Peoples' Instictive Travels...""). ""Midnight Marauders"" was solid, but I never really got into that one. The strong point of this album starts with ""The Pressure"" and ending with ""Keep It Moving,"" probably the strongest 6-10 lineup I've heard on any cd. Q-Tip's solo ""Get A Hold"" is a standout too, and probably my favorite on the disc. This album is worth buying alone for tracks 2 and 6-10. ""Phony Rappers"" and ""Wordplay"" are songs that are also not to be missed. ""Separate/Together"" is a beautiful short track as well. I really like the feel of ""Stressed Out,"" even though Consequence delivers a weak last verse (like he does thoughout most of his few turns throughout the album), nontheless Faith's vocals leave with the perfect mood ending the disc.In no way did the Tribe fall off starting here. I prefer this album to ""Midnight Marauders"" any day. I pretty much hated this album at first and ended up loving it, a sign of a true classic and that the Tribe were trying new things. The rhymes are more laid-back and focused, and almost perfect while giving new definitions of positivity. Q-Tip is not to be missed here. I ended up enjoying many of the beats very much and consider some of them as their best since ""Peoples' Instinctive..."". Buy this and you will find out that the Tribe offer many suggestions here on how to perfect your ""Beats, Rhymes, and Life."" Im sorry but a tribe called quest's ""beats rhymes & life"" is wack and so is atcq coz dey are boring and their beats ain't good at all. Their single dey had ""stressed out"" is lame as hell. Dont support dese lamez. I admit, ya'll: Beats, Rhymes and Life was my first Tribe album. I listened to that disc up and down and thought that it was the bomb when it came out in '96. Then I heard all of the negative comments about it. How can it be bad? So I thought I'd school myself and listen to their first three albums. Then I listened to Beats, Rhymes and Life again, and I said, ""Oh.""This album ain't the bomb, it's a bomb. The first and major flaw is the production. Instead of Tribe producing everything as usual, The Ummah takes care of everything: soft, radio-friendly R&B; drenched vibes that lack the gritty and bumpy feel of past Tribe tracks like ""Clap Your Hands"" and ""Show Business"". ""1nce Again"" and ""Stressed Out"" are good in their own way (the latter features Q-Tip saying, ""Brothas on the block packing nines like September""), but the production just isn't A Tribe Called Quest. ""Wordplay"" is lyrically a decent song but that music in the background sounds like a lullaby. And another problem is that one-time protege Consequence has a few verses too many. He's good, but he needed more practice back then.But another shocking flaw is the lack of dope rhyming by Tipster and Phife Diddawg themselves. Here's an example: ""Phife Dawg swinging back and forth just like Aaliyah/Making moves on your heart like that kid Tamia/No doubt about it, I love hip-hop to death/But yo, Tip, bring in the chorus 'cause I'm losing my breath"" (from ""Baby Phife's Return""). This line sounds like a baby wrote it. It was hard to admit it back then, but the Tribesters were aging and just weren't hot anymore. This especially shows on the unfocused, wannabe-thuggish song ""Crew"" where Q-Tip bucks someone down for gamin' at his wife. We all know Tip ain't no fighter. That incident makes ""Phony Rappers"" sound like a dedication to Tip.There are still some songs that show vintage Tribe like ""Keep It Moving"", ""Get a Hold"" (where Tip says, ""My record company be on some true jerk ish/But that's aight cuz now I'm on some true work ish""), and ""The Hop"" where Phife REALLY shines (""This ain't no Barnum & Baliley show, I don't get down with no clowns""). Those songs work well and the production is dope enough. Also, honorable mention goes to ""Jam"" where they give a story about a not-so-memorable party. Too bad that this album is not so memorable. This would be a classic album if this were Tribe's first album, but judging from their first three albums (especially Midnight Marauders), I expected better. 1996 was a good year for J Dilla in hip-hop. He produced acts such as The Pharcyde, Mad Skillz, Keith Murray, Busta Rhymes, and De La Soul. But when it comes to him hooking with Q-Tip and Ali as the ""Ummah"", I knew the sound of the Tribe ain't the same just like the first 3 classic albums. Beats,Rhymes,and Life came out on July 30,1996 and I was finished elementary school at Greeenvile and went to Sherwood Middle from 6 to 8th grade. I was in 6th grade during the 1996-97 school year. The reason of it was Tip coverted to Islam as ""Kamaal Fareed"", Phife moving to Atlanta post-Midnight Marauders but stil keeps it real for himself in particular. I can remember seeing their videos ""1nce Again"" and ""Stressed Out"" and it was a flop or misstep. The uncomfortable step with Tip made was he puts his cousin Consequence in the set that seems not good at all. It's official:It was the beginning of the end of ATCQ. Although i love The Jam, The Crew, and The Pressure because them 3 songs were very dark into it. Few songs that talks about the issues of East Coast v. West Coast rivalry including Mind Power, Keeping It Moving, and my favorable Baby Phife's Return. The beats were sounded okay but not real good. I think the ending of Tribe begins with their 3rd LP Midnight Marauders and from that point on between 1994 and 1996, it all came crashing down due to the East/West beef clashes the rap game so to speak. Q-Tip lost that edge when he put Consequence on their album ant that the reason. I can't blame on Phife, Ali, or Jarobi for that one either. I loved the album because of the beats not the lyrics. Q-Tip and Phife's chemistry was gone it was hard, tough, and strange. This was the beginning of the end of A Tribe Called Quest, for real!! Otherwise, i like that album obviously. Tribe Called Quest's 4th album Beats,Rhymes, and Life truly expresses their growth from boys to men.  It's not as good as The Love Movement but it really shows they improve with age. This isn't exactly THE GREATEST Tribe Called Quest album of all time, but  it still stands above a lot of the hip-hop music that was out during that  era.  The beats are solid and very smooth with a hint of that jazzy tone to  it, and the lyrics are a little more serious unlike some of their older  albums, but they're still fresh.  Tribe Called Quest has NEVER put out a  bad album, so I don't know why people have to hate on this one just because  &quot;it isn't the usual TRIBE.&quot;  It isn't the usual TRIBE...at this  time, Q-Tip's step toward religious peace was close, and the Phife was  taking the business more seriously at the time.  Flava Flav said it  best...&quot;DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!&quot;  This album is a classic and  when times are tough with all of that commercial &quot;Bling Bling/Cash  Money&quot; hip-hop, you can ALWAYS pull out an old Tribe album to make the  day brighter.  If I could, I would give &quot;Beats, Rhymes, and Life&quot;  4.5 stars instead of just 4. 2 1/2Accessibly street-wise, overground hip-hop is head-bobbingly competent but approaching staleness. The only reason why people bash this album is because it followed PEOPLE'S INSTICTIVE TRAVELS..., THE LOW END THEORY,  and MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS.  Yes, I do not think that this album is quite on the level with the first three, to say that Tribe fell off is ridiculous.  There were definitely some banging tracks on this album.  And Consequence is a nice addition to the album.  My favorite tracks on this album are ""Jam"", ""The Pressure"", ""1nce Again"" and ""Stressed Out"".  If people would judge this album on its own merit, rather than compare it to past classics, this album would be seen as a great album in its own right.  Don't listen to what detractors might say, ALL TRIBE ALBUMS ARE ESSENTIAL LISTENS.  Yes, the sound changed a bit, but that does not mean that it is BAD.  Listen to album and draw your own conclusions. When this album came out I ran and bought it because it's Tribe. When I listened to the album I was dissapointed. The beats were corny and the lyrics were wack. The album sounds like it was rushed. There is only 1 good  track on the entire album and that's it. Incredible album from beginning to end. My most personal favorite track that I believe stands out is ""Word Play"" what an amazing song. The best hip-hop original group with pure positive consistency hands down. A must have album!! R.I.P. Dilla. Can you stop hatin by saying this cd isnt solid this cd is good too I love this very tribe calles quest music just not as classic as L.E.T. and M.M but this will sastift your tribe needs Get it! beats rhymes and life is another classic tribe album of what true hip hop is. this is true hip hop not that phoney lil wayne 'ish. I def recomend you get they're other classic albums as well. A Tribe Called Quest's album ""Beats, Rhymes and Life"" is an overlooked album.  The success of ""The Low End Theory"" and ""Midnight Marauders"" shadowed its greatness, for now, 10 years later, one can look at it and see what it was really trying to say.  Much of the album complains about the East Coast vs. West Coast atmosphere of the time, urging their macho gangsta rap companions to stop the violence before things get out of hand.  In September of that year, 2Pac was shot and killed in Vegas.  Notorious BIG was killed next year in 1997.  Nobody, apparently, was listening.The Album marks the turn from the Low End/Midnight sound and towards what would eventually become The Love Movement.  It demonstrates a perfect middle ground between the two sides and ends up better than most would expect.  You wont find the greatest songs Tribe produced here, but there are some excellent tracks to be heard.  Pick this up for your Tribe collection and take a glimpse into history. A lot of people said Tribe fell off with this album.  I strongly disagree with that assessment.  The sound is a little different because production is handled by the Ummah, but the lyrics and vibe of this album is still on point.  Peace. I like it man , its was a great deal. I wish I could find more things I like on this thing. Listening to this really takes you back. You getaway real picture of what was going on at the time in hip hop. We were in the middle of an East / West coast beef. Tupac and Biggie or Bad Boy records were at each other's throats. The Tribe reflected this in their prolific profanity. Something that they never used extensively. Some of the profanity could have been left out, it seemed to be used just to sound like everybody else. For example Phife's lyric saying &#34;will Laura $&@$ Erkel?&#34;. Not funny and not necessary. Other than that it still proves that Tip and Phife got skills. The cd has a few hot joints on it but I think this is the worst of their albums next to the first one. If you have a short attention span, like ready-made beats and hooks and don't care what the rappers say as long as it rhymes and they look cute doing it, then SKIP THIS!!! &quot;Beats&quot; is more of a concept album ,  a collage, and it takes more than one listen to really feel it. The beats  are rich and murky, and the rhymes reflect the individual and collective  growth (Phife as an MC, Q-Tip embracing his Muslim faith, etc.). Of course,  because this is Tribe, the expectations were stratospherically high, and  most of the tracks don't disappoint (&quot;Motivators&quot;, &quot;Get A  Hold&quot;, &quot;1nce Again&quot;, &quot;Stressed Out&quot;, &quot;The  Pressure&quot;). I think that the problem was that Jive, according to Ali,  put serious undue pressure on them ot put out something, or else, with a  deadline, for the first time EVER, and then they brought in the Ummm, and  that kind of muddied the vision that they didn't have the time to develop  on their own. Still, this is, like every other Tribe album I own, well  worth every penny. Shame on Jive, for stressing the brothers like that, but  that's the business, I guess. If you love the Tribe, DON'T BELIEVE THE  HYPE!!! GET IT!!! LONG LIVE THE QUESTERS!!! My nephew gave me a copy of this for Christmas 2001.  I knew Q-Tip from his guest appearances on De La Soul and others' albums and was a little familiar with early ATCQ singles like Bonita Applebaum but I was surprised by how much I liked this album.  The whole group has great synergy and the beats are excellent.  I have maybe 20 rap albums so I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means but as a music fan I really like this album a lot and am glad I have it in my collection. to give you a general idea of the hip hop artists first inspired me-MF Doom, Eligh, Buck 65, Zion I, and Sole....so, as this may come as a suprise, this album completely blew me away..it is timeless..i am now an ardent fan of Tribe..but none, and i mean NONE, of their other albums even come close to this...man, if you don't grab this record-a true loss..this is true art...tribe at their peak..too bad The Love Movement couldn't sustain the talent..anyway..this and Midnight Marauders are masterpieces.. I believe this was the last true Tribe album. The Love Movement didn't exactly seem like the way they should go out to me. This album reminds me of high school and being down the shore. I can't even explain to you the way I used to zone out to ""Get a Hold"", an overlooked track on this album. The rhymes are slick, as is to be expected from Q and Phife - and the tracks are all soulful and creatively constructed. 1nce Again was the single off this album and it really captured the Tribe sound as it had developed over time.A solid effort from one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time. ATCQ has another great album here with some fantastic songs with great replayability. I can't say I like ALL the songs but the ones that I do like, I like A LOT! You thought Shock and Awe went down in Iraq.  That was nothing compared to my expression after reading these less than 5 star reviews for this album.I've heard the other Tribe albums, I understand how it can be taken that they lose that funky vibe that they had once before, but it is all in a positive way.  It is a professional album, leaps beyond its predecessors both musically and lyrically.  Like any band capable of creating music that sticks generations, they only progressed with each album- this is no exception.Jazz is engraved within the grooves of this lyrical masterpiece.  If I were walking down 14th in NYC I'm not sure that there is anything else I would want to listen to.  I mean they are the NYC / World sound they claim to be.Listen to knowledge being dropped over beats, and don't let these reviews deter you from these volumes.  The music is On Point.  I hope my review helped because it seems that many on this board lost faith as they did with Public Enemy.  I guess it takes mental fitness to stick with solidity. One of Tribe's best and  also one of the most unheard of. Some of their greatest tracks except for the sellout ""stressed out"" - which inspired the industry to label them as anything but ""real"" hey listen man, i've got all of their albums and this is my favourite, certainly. it's great production, with some quality lyrics. ATCQ dont have a single crap album to their name and this is no exception.the best tracks IMO areKeeping It MovingThe PressureHopWhat really Goes Onall of which are 10/10 standard tracksthe rest are 8.5 standardthere's not a single skippable track including the opening track. you honestly won't regret buying this CD, it's not a possibility. if anyone says this album is their worst or rubbish, don't take notice of them, and i say that not because i am a massive ATCQ fan, but because they honestly DO NOT know good music. they probbaly think The Game and G-Unit are lengendary or somethin'. This trio (2-mic pioneers along with their DJ) was one of the most lyrically gifted in the music genre of Hip-Hop, they are truly missed.  This was their next to last CD and it's still a work of art even today some ten years after it's release.The blends of Jazz 'n bass-heavy beats (East Coast ""muddy"" bass) was truly and still is truly inovative.It's worth a listen to those who follow rappers or would even like to explore the ever growing genre of Urban-Hip-Hop Jazz. A tribe called quest is the greatest rap group of all time.  This is Tribe's fourth cd and also their fourth best cd.  while it is a decent disc, it lacks the creative flavor of their other three classics.  The beats are just not up to par, and the lyrics are a little too preachy, and not abstract which is q-tip's fortay.  Not to say this is a bad cd, it just doesn't compare to any of their others, besides The Love Movement, which was terrible.  The tracks that stand out are, &quot;Jam&quot; and &quot;once again.&quot;  I would rate this a three out of five, but if your not a tribe fan you would probably think this cd is dull and boring. I got this around when i was in my early teens , now 20 , i really like how Hip Hop evolved until now though (2003) , i noticed a change around 99' with poof duddy and the ''dirty south'' , both i hate very much .. but if your looking for a good Hip Hop album pick this one up ... R.I.P HIP HOP This album is wicked. It's my favorite release from Tribe. I suggest you check this out if you're new to the group. And if you consider yourself a fan, but you haven't heard this yet, then pick it up. CLASSIC.LYRICS ------------ 10/10PRODUCTION COURTESY OF SAHEED MUHAMMED ----------- 10/10ALBUM COVER ---------- 10/10THEME ----------- 10/10STANDOUT TRACKS --------- ALL TRACKSCONCEPT ---------- 10/10OVERALL ----------- STOP HATIN ON THIS GEM.P.S  I'M BACK IN NEW JERZ SON. A lot of people are complaining about this album. Why? Just because the production is different. Take note...MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS dropped in 1993. BEATS,RHYMES AND LIFE dropped in 1996. Do you really expect them to have the same jazzy sounds. I mean, a lot can happen in 3 years. Anyway, this album is a great addition to the Tribe collection. Every song on this album is good and the beats are excellent, therefore making this a classic. This album will always be remembered as the album that changed their image. But it's still a great album anyhow. Top joints on this album are : PHONY RAPPERS, MOTIVATORS, MIND POWER, THE HOP, KEEPING IT MOVING, WHAT REALLY GOES ON and the best song on this album WORD PLAY. The past 3 albums were produced by Ali Shaheed & Q-Tip, on this one...Jay Dee of Slum Village joins the crew forming THE UMMAH. So the beats are really good. This is my 2nd favorite Tribe album, MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS being my favorite, and this is one of my Top 10 favorite album ever made. Just don't compare it to MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS cause this is a different approach but still a great album. Recommended to any fan of real Hip-Hop ! Let's get this out in the open right now: This CD is not on par with the first three Tribe CD's...but then again, what is?The first major change in Tribe's presentation is the production. At this period, Tip &amp; Ali hooked up with then up-and-coming producer JayDee to form the conglomerate the Uhmah (the brotherhood). To me, and a lot of poeple, despite Tip &amp; Ali making up 2/3 of the team, JayDee's influence shined much more than either Tip's or Ali's. Tribe fans were dealing with a whole new sound. While most of the fans were NOT pleased with it (this album is always referred to as Tribe's biggest dissappointment), I, on the other hand, was blown away at first listen. From the use of the chants in 'GET A HOLD', to the use of the guitar sample as percussion on 'KEEP IT MOVIN', to his incredible kick drum programming on 'WORDPLAY', this CD shows JayDee developing into the top-notch producer he is today. To anyone who has just gotten into JayDee's work, I recommend this CD.There is one major problem with this CD however. The only complaint about this CD that is justified.CONSEQUENCE.Q-Tip made a huge mistake by bringing his no-talent relative into this CD. CONSEQUENCE not only has a horrible voice, but his rhymes are far worse than the Slum Village &amp; the Group Home combined. &quot;Thirstier than Sprite&quot;? &quot;I got the love in your mouth&quot;? His presence was absolutely unnecessary, a hinderance this CD could have done without.This CD is a must-have for all JayDee fans, even with Consequence's wack rhymes hindering things (but then agan, after repeated listening to the Slum Village, that's something we all should be used to). I'm a make this short and sweet.  Tribe is one of the greatest hip hop groups ever(next to Wu Tang Clan)and I can honestly say that what makes this group so special is how they connect, Phife and Q Tip blend so freaking good together especially with Muhammads amazing yet very kick back beats.  Why is this getting less then 5 stars or more I really dont know, all I know is that this is an incredible hip hop album with some really kick ass songs.  Is it ""Midnight Mauraders""?  Nah, is it ""The Low End Theory""?...Nope but is it still an amazing hip hop album....hell yes..  It even has one of my favorite Tribe Songs ever ""The Hop""...god I love the chorus to that song..Well anyways COP THIS album!  Its deff a must have for any Hip Hop Heads...best songs on the album are deff ""Mind Power"" ""The Hop""  ""Phony Rappers"" ""1ce again"" ""Stressed Out"" and many more....thats it im done.....not really a review but a rant...5/5! BEATS is quite different from the Tribe albums prior to it.  It simply flows the entire time.  Tip and Phife sound calm and smooth on this album.....excellent and synergistic.  Lyrics don't clash like other no-talent A@@ clowns out there (eminem).  These guys know what they're doing and lay it down right here. The sounds are fresh and move with tip and phife perfectly.  There is not a jagged unsmooth moment on this album.  A MUST have for even a tribe novice!! q-tip and phife are a tight duo.nough said right there.this album is full of cool beats and rhymes.I can bob my head to the whole disc.check out every track,though I didn't like track 13being censored on my copy.1nce again,wordplay,the album opener phony rappers,can't stop putting in my player.see that price?it's worth all of it.buy it.peace The addition of Q-Tip's cousin Consequence on BRL, threw me for a loop. It totally messed up the chemistry between Abstract and the 5 footer. This joint was just okay for me. Nothing like the 3 preceding classics. I admit, when I first purchased this album and gave it a listen, I was  very disappointed. I thought the beats were simple and that Tribe had lost  the charisma that made them my favorite group in the first place. But,  after this grew on me, I realized that this was a very solid album and it  was not bad at all. My prime reason for being disappointed was that I had  expected a Midnight Marauders Part II. This album has some very memorable  songs including, Jam(my favorite on the album), Innovators, The Hop, Baby  Phife's Return and Keep It Moving. There is not one song on this entire  album that I dislike. The lyrics are also on point. Overall, I would say  that this was a pretty good effort by Tribe. This CD is amazing, from track 1-15, i listen to it in my car everyday, and i still love it. I never really listened to rap that much, now tribe got me hooked especially this CD, for any true hiphop fan this is a must  have, i mean it. I just wish hiphop today was still innovative. This album was the beginning of the end for A Tribe.  They'd produced some of the genre's greatest albums in the early 90s.By the time this came out, hip hop was changing a bit.  You'll notice that the jazz influence was really non-existent on this one.  This has a lot more upbeat, party beats to it; which isn't to say that's bad, but to say that it doesn't seem like the Tribe I grew up on.Still, Phife and Qtip's lyrics were still solid.  One major complaint is the new guy, Consequence, who really doesn't seem to fit in.  It was a bad idea; I'm not sure what they were thinking.Still, this is a decent Tribe release.  It's far from their best but still better than most.  This was it for them (if you don't count the horrendous Love Movement); the end of an era. The groups 3 previous releases, yes I will agree don't allow this LP to fit in their usual sound...but even though Tribe decided to leave their own separate universe and join Earth and rap about actual youth topics, it still deserves it's credit... this is also a more commercialized side of ATCQ, but they have the talent to make it sound good...Throw in some of Tip's hypnotical toned voice, some of Phife's new evolved battle rap ability, and Ali Shaheed's excellent music display and you have yet another great ATCQ album...highlights of this cd were ...  &quot;Phony Rappers&quot; , &quot;Motivators&quot; , &quot;1nce Again&quot; , &quot;Mind Power&quot; , &quot;The Hop&quot; , &quot;Keeping It Moving&quot; , &quot;Word Play&quot; , and &quot;Stressed Out&quot;...there aren't really any negative sides to the CD just except the part after Jam where Tip curses in every sentence...that's the only negative bitterness on the cd....other than that check it out if your a true hiphop head... listen...""Peoples Instinctive Travels..."", Low End.."" and ""Midnight.."" are all brilliant..The production was fascinating and original, cementing ATCQ as an extremely original crew...not only that, they are without a doubt an integral pioneer to the culture of hip hop itself..without them, a major piece of the puzzle would be missing...native tongue lyricism helped spawn other diverse wordsmiths such as Mos Def and Talib Kweli (respectively known as Blackstar-another extremely dope duo..)..but..Phife and Tip as a lyricist-duo were probably the most brilliant ever...Tip would come with that beautiful abstract perspective, and Phife come with that raw, free flow stuff...touching souls man....anyway..on to ""Beats, Rhymes, and Life""....this is probably the greatest hip hop record released in the later 90's...only to be competed with by MF Doom's ""Operation Doomsday""...but not even Doom's gem can really stand the test of this..maily due to the approach of this album...which i doubt will ever be surpassed..they came fresher than a baby's a*s with this sh*t...Jay Dee creates some of the greatest soundscapes i've ever heard on a hip hop record...the soul just smacks you in the face..and then comes the reign of Tip..i mean, Phife is excellent on this release....and with the addition of consequence...good stuff...but this is Tip's pinnacle..his opus...a word to the world before he leaves his art...(no offence, but Tip just went downhill, letting the fruits of the industry rob his talents, and leave him starving for capitol and sex,...too bad...cause this album is a masterpiece)....his lyrics are reflective, intelligent, positive, and catchy...he mastered the craft of the emcee....and then the songs...i am not going to give an individual synopsis, that would be useless, seeing as every song is equally as brilliant..even the most commercial tracks are excellent...let me say that (at least to me), the trach 1nce Again sums up the entire feel and strength of this masterpiece...if you do not purchase this...i feel damn sorry for you...RIP ATQC...REAL HIP HOP.....NOT THE CRAP YOU ARE CONFRONTED WITH EVERYDAY..THIS IS WHEN THE ARTIST CONTROLLED HIS DESTINY...WHEN THE ARTIST EXPRESSED HIS TRUE VIEWS...WHEN THE ARTIST RELISHED IN HIS CRAFT....WHEN THE ARTIST LOVED THE MUSIC Excuse me, but what LP have all you so-called hip hop fans been listening to? &quot;Tribe really fell off&quot; is a favorite catchphrase people have using since this was released in 1996 and I still don't get it! &quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot; is the most perfect album these gents have ever crafted and stands as a true classic in any genre. Tribes first 3 albums have been elevated to classic status because they all were released in quick succession, but after a 3 1/2 year lay off, the group lost some of it's core audience and the narrow-minded, fickle people who call themselves true hip hop 'heads' jumped on the &quot;let's bash Tribe&quot; bandwagon and deemed this album wack. What a terrible mistake! From the bangin' opener &quot;Phony Rappers&quot; this is a new, refreshed and mature Tribe and over the course of 15 tracks, Q-Tip, Phife and Shaheed top themselves over and over again. My personal faves from this album change every week (currently it's &quot;Jam&quot; featuring some of the best drums EVER to appear on a tribe album) so I won't single out any tracks, I will merely say this album can be listened to from start to finish without ever hitting skip/forward on your CD player.  Special Musical Note: This CD gets special love from me for giving a much deserved shout-out to the then recently deceased Phyllis Hyman (on &quot;Baby Phifes Return&quot;).  Ignore the naysayers, &quot;B R &amp; L&quot; is a stunning achievement. Worth Owning. This is an ill TCQ album! This album has some pretty ill beats on, some laid back but some with some sick loops on it. The lyrics are of course, always ill, when arent they? This is real hiphop beats though, on the real and the lyrics. Some of the beats arent that great, im more of a wu-tang beat fan haha. But there nice.

218,439,B000000545,"This is just as solid as his first and then them.B-legit is showing the world that the Clicks sucsess was no fluke and how bright the future for him and the sickwitit family really is...From E-40 and the Click to the  Mossie this is the team thats been here since 92 and I don't see that  changin any time soon....(I was at Philly Blunts studio in Vallejo back in  September of 98 and a heard a new B-legit song that was recorded for his  new album and it was off the hook..I hope it makes the album.....)Watch 4  the new album cuz he keeps gettin better..... He brings the nice vibe with tracks like Hemp Museum and City to City with the mellow styles of Check It Out.  He then ends his album with some of the hardest gangsta tracks that anybody from The Click has ever spit on a microphone.  I would have liked to hear Levitti on a few more of the hooks, though. Sometimes rappers have too many artists feaured, but the guest features of Kurupt, A1, and Celly Cel make the album even better.  This is slightly his best release, and it proves that the best city in the world when it comes to rap is Vallejo. Well if you like the click and are a yea area rap fan this should be one of your favorites. I'm sure if you asked more than 100 w/coast rap fans if legit can hold his own at least 80 would say he can. Even though his cousin e-40 blew up the click, legit could have blow up himself with a big label backing him. B-legit has always had a good solid understandable flow, he raps right on the beat, kinda like too short. He really dosen't need the help of the click but it would be a crime if they didn't rap together, c'mon I mean there family. Now to the album it's self. Producers Studio Ton  and Mike Mosley are never a let down, they can always suply none stop mob funk. All the songs on here u should be able to listen to because legit can flow and the producing is good but if u like legit for his hardcore sound than you'll do like me and skip over the softer tracks at times. The guess apperances on the album are very good and with all creditable w/coast rapper's( C-Bo,Kurupt,Celly Cel,40,A1,Lil Bruce and the Mossie). Singer Levitti also adds a much needed soulful sound to the album. What really suprises me about this album is tha song &quot;Getto Smile&quot;, which is a wonderfull remake colaberation of singer Daryl Hall's original late 70's hit &quot;Smile for me&quot;, Daryl Hall singing the chourus in between legits rap verses. Also the bonus track #15, not originaly intended to be on the album is a nice gift to all B-legits fans. Just one year since his solo debut, the Savage is back with his best album of his 5 to date (I don't have his debut album).  Of the 13 songs on here, there is 1 classic, 9 good songs, and the other 3 are ok, no bad songs on here.  Like all his albums I have, guests are on alot of the songs (on every one on here actually) but B-Legit still tears it up. Production is great, especially for his flow and his style.  A lot of funky beats with deep bass grooves make it a good album to listen to straight through, and some good samples are used as well.  Studio Ton does 5 songs, Kevin Gardner & Redwine, and Mike Mosely each do 2 songs, and Femi Ojetunde, Tone Capone, K-Lou & Funk Daddy all do 1 song. A must have album for fans of his, the Click or northern Cali rap.#2 - 9 (f/ Levitti -- nice beat)#3 - 8.5 (f/ Dionne Jackson)#4 - 8 (f/ E-40 & Kurupt)#5 - 10 (CLASSIC -- f/ Lil Bruce & C-Bo -- great upbeat production and sampling used)#6 - 8 (f/ Suga T & Emgee)#7 - 8 (f/ The Mossie)#8 - 7.5 (f/ Daryl Hall -- another decent sample)#10 - 7.5 (f/ Mac Shawn)#11 - 9 (f/ C-Bo & Celly Cel -- nice beat)#12 - 8 (f/ Harm -- upbeat song)#13 - 8 (f/ Big Bone & D-Day -- nice beat)#14 - 7 (f/ Levitti)#15 - 8 (f/ Mac Shawn, G-Note & K-1 -- nice beat)Brandt Jones -- Vallejo, CA B-Legit holds it down for the Yay Area but not with &quot;The Click&quot; but solo wise. He makes sure you feel this album with knockin' beats and lyrics showing you that he's not in 40 waters shadow. Not only does he put it down by himself but he features some of the top rappers puttin' it down for California. I recommend this album to everyone who likes E-40, Suga T, D-Shot, and &quot;The Click&quot; because B-Legit shows he's a major part of &quot;The Click&quot; B-Legit comes through in a major way with his second project &quot;The Hemp Museum&quot;. The CD from top to bottom is just superb from &quot;City 2 City&quot; with LeVitti, &quot;For So Long&quot;(Mike Mosley doing what he does best), &quot;Check It Out&quot;(Kurupt & E-40 adds some great lyrics on this track and Studio Ton provides a great mob beat to it), &quot;Gotta Buy Dope From Us&quot;(C-Bo & Little Bruce serves up some game on this track). I can go on & on but this is just a sample of how good this CD is. There is not one weak track on here. The Hemp Museum is in a class of it's own. Check It Out!! This cd is better than his first. He is more versitle on this one. He got alot more guest on here. Ghetto smile is a good song. Check this cd out ClassicI go track by track:(1) A very dope nice produced intro (as usual for an intro from Studio Ton, Sick Wid' It's main producer)(2) nice track with Levitti singing. It was also released as a vinyl promo single on &#34;The Sick Sides&#34;(3) another nice track, with another singer(4) The first single featuring Kurupt from DPG and E-40 - the beat gets a bit boring if you play it on repeat however it's a nice G-Funk beat and it sounds like it's only the background for the rap here.(5) samples &#34;Another One Bites The Dust&#34; however I don't find nothing special about the beat while C-Bo and Little Bruce rap tight(6) the title track, I like it, it has cousin Suga T & Emgee singing the hook(7) this one is just as dope if not doper than the songs before it(8) the second single which was also on the Ice Cube film Dangerous Grounds (he's in the video). Darryl Hall sings the hook because it samples &#34;Sara Smile&#34; but in such a fine way it's an instant Bay Area Classic(9) interlude for condoms(10) this track is from 1995 and very bass heavy(11) another bass heavy track, tight appearances by Celly Cel & C-Bo, however, Mike Mosley's beats sound a bit flat w/o coproduction by Sam Bostic who split in 1995(12) Tone Capone's contribution to the album. (I got 5 on it) The beat sounds a bit strange but it knocks!(13) My favourite off the album! The beat is made by K-Lou and it's incredibly dope. You might have heard it in the video of A-1 &#34;Represent&#34;(14) samples Isaac Hayes, good track(15) Funk Daddy's contribution to the album, a dope track too.No filler, you can play this on repeat, many guests, very hardcore but also tracks with singers on it, it's a classic One of the best albums I've ever heard. B-Legit's great delivery and lyrics along with many fly guest featured over this tight production - it just makes a perfect album with the bay area flava. C-Bo, Kurupt, E40, Celly Cell and many more join the Savage in one of the west coast best and most underrated albums. Get that fly sh*t!!! I first heard of B-Legit on 2Pac's ""All Eyez On Me"" and 40 Water's ""In A Major Way,"" and I am glad I did!  B-Legit's 2nd album ""The Hemp Museum,"" is tight.  It is straight hard-hittin' g-funk you can bend corners to and lowride to!  He keeps it old school on ""Neva Bite"" (#7)with whiny synths and a faint use of a talk box in the hook.  #6, ""Hemp Museum"" is laid back, funky, and fresh, one to hit switches to, or ride with the top down!! ""For So Long"" (#3) is also tight with a kickin' beat and use of the whiny synths.  Be sure ""Check It Out,"" and cop it! this cd is tight. B legit's flow is fat but also laid back and funky like the G-funk style.B-legit is recognized in the west and has done featuring for 2pac in all eyes on me. On the cd there are featurings of e-40 (b legit's cousin), kurupt, celli cell, and little bruce.All the song are good. This cd will relax you and it is an excellent choice for chiling with friends. It's a good cd with good lyrics and much better than actually cds with bling-bling rappers.

It's has been a while since it first came out, but for all those so called playas that ain't bumpin this sh%t.  You better get your a s s to a record store and buy it.  Peace. Back in '97, I believed that hip hop was changing. The previous two years, the Bay Area was dishing out hit after hit from artists like E-40 & The Click, The Luniz, Too Short and The Dangerous Crew, etc. Mostly around that time due to recent tragedies of Tupac and Biggie, the east coast and the west were showing unity between the two regions. Although on this LP, there are no colab from anyone but the west, mostly from northern and southern California (as a path followed by Ant Banks'Big Thangsreleased the same year) Spice 1 has dropped a few gems as well along that time. His sixth album ""The Black Bossalini"" really comes as a real solid LP full of gangsta tales, as something that you have mostly have heard from him in the past.The first and the easiest standout track would be ""Thug In Me"" as the song is dedicated to his close friend Tupac. The beat on the song would exactly fit the style of Pac. The following track ""I'm High"" is a song dedicated to smoking weed. ""Recognize Game"" features Too Short and Ice-T, that is real solid. ""Playa Man"" is very lively track, as Spice 1 has a sped up flow over the beat (yeah, I saw that fresh cut he had in the video as well). ""Caught In My Gunplay"" is very mellow and laid back sounding. Me I think it is kind of weak, but at the same time, solid. ""Ballin'"" is excellent with the beat provided by Hen Gee, and features Caffine, Yukmouth of the Luniz, Gazzepha, and MC Breed. ""The Boss Mobsta"" is another track to fit Spice 1's style in rapping (think of his earlier songs). ""510, 213"" are odes to the area codes of the Bay Area and Los Angeles respectively with the help of W.C. and Big Syke. ""Kill Street Blues"" is a great track laced by a nice hook. ""Fetty Chico And The Mack"" has a dope beat by Ant Banks, but I'm not feeling the hook or some of the rhymes. ""Wanna Be A G."" and ""Diamonds"" are both solid tracks. ""Down Payment On Heaven"" is a song dedicated to his deceased homies. The final track ""2 Hands & A Razorblade"" is Spice 1 telling a story about being locked in the L.A. County Pen.Spice 1 doesn't dissapoint here on this album. But at the same time, this is nowhere nearAmeriKKKa's Nightmare, which is the only other Spice 1 album that I own. Mainly I don't own1990-Sick, as many reviewers are mentioning. The album here as many rememerable cuts and good production (curteosy of Paris, Ant Banks, and others). Thankfully Jive records has kept this in print, as well as their other popular Bay Area artists (i.e. Too Short and E-40). Fans of Bay Area rap will enjoy this here, mostly for the tracks that I said were great. Peace.Lyrics: A-Production B+Guest Appearances: B-Musical Vibes: B+Top 5 Tracks:1. Thug In Me (Dedicated to Tupac Shakur: R.I.P.)2. Ballin' (featuring Yukmouth, Caffeine, Gazzepha, and MC Breed)3. The Boss Mobsta4. Kill Street Blues5. Playa ManHonorable Mention:1. 2 Hands And A Razorblade2. Diamonds Spice 1, unlike the majority of modern rappers in the buisness...is real, his music defines the area he is from,the era in which he grew up and he spares no expense to tell you his story. His music seems to get more creative with age and ""The Black Bossalini"" is no exception. I live on the East coast so you would think i listen to east coast rappers,wrong, Spice 1 is the only rap I listen to because his beats are unbelievably amazing, and his lyrics hit every spectrum,funny,emotional,angry. Track 5 on the disk, Caught up in my gunplay,is my personal favorite,for the bass line,but for lyrics, the song Im high is number 1,Spice 1 can spit some fast words. ""2 hands and a razorblade"" sounds like a snoop dogg song,with a Spiggity-spice 1 twist, and ""510,213"" sounds like some classic funk but again,spice one can rip over any style of music. ""the black bossalini"" is a keeper.Song ratings:1. Caught up in my gunplay2. I'm High3. 510,2134.Playa Man-(check the vid for this song on you tube)5. Kill Street Blues6. Diamonds7. Wana be a G8.Fetty Chico and the mack9. Down payment on heaven10. Recognize game11. 2 hands and a razor blade12 The thug in me13. the boss mobsta14. ballin I believe the only reason this album is not liked more than hes previous effort is purely due to it being hes next release.  The album is more of a 1990-Sick part 2 than a knew inovative effort and I think alot of fans expect to much of there rappers to create knew ideas and beats instead of just cranking the bass and feeling the beats and bouncing on the ride.  Black Bossalini does this better than Sick although both albums are simply impressive.  Spice 1 is one of the games best flowing MCs pretty much only his trade mark and annoyingly boring BLOW call takes prestige off hes name.  However he has been given deep riding beats again on this album to work with and it comes off in a much enjoyable way.  The opening 2 tracks are great openers especially Im High.  Its a great song to listen to in that way.  Ant Banks steals the show as Fetty Chico and the Mack has a typical deep funk groove by the master producer and Recognize game is up there as one of the best as well.  Ballin is a fun track and Diamonds is one of the best softer produced tracks I have heard by any artist.  The hook is extremely catchy.  This is Spice 1s best in my opinion.  It makes me wonder how he could drop so low with hes follow up to this Immortalized.  Its not even worth rating. He does it again.  His 5th album is yet another classic to add to his collection of many.  This man shows as he ages he still can rap, and rap good.  It has 3 classics, 1 song I skip, 1 that's ok and the rest are good or great.  Production is great and handled by a lot of people, Paris (4 songs), ant Banks, Ric Rock, and Ali Malek (2 songs each), and Hen gee, Payback, Mike Mosely each do a song and Femi O. co-produces on 2 tracks.  If he had airplay out here on the east coast I'd bet he'd have many multi-platinum plaques on his wall. That's what's wrong with rap, hardly any of the good rappers sell.  All th fake a*s pu*sy's sell the most.  If you wanna hear some real rap from a real cat who's been in the game puttin out albums since '88 check out Spice 1.

Robert Lee Green in Texas around 1971 - moved to Hayward, CA""Can't fu*k wit the East Bay G""Check out all my reviews Although It's not as Heavy as his other songs I've Heard. Nor as Good As 1-800-C.o.l.l.e.c.t., It's good , It has ICE T on it, Mack 10, but thats not what makes it good, despite it's shortcomings compared to previous works, Spice 1 still does it gritty. Spice is a Good Story teller. The item was shipped in a timely matter and it was in great shape. Thank you for your time & Patience in this matter. On this album Spice 1 comes out on most of the songs a bit less hardcore than the usual, I guess he wants to change his style a little bit, he matured. He is less the cold-hearted murdera and more like an OG playa. But still on songs  like the Boss Mobsta and 2 Hands & a Razorblade Spice Ace rips s*** up  and does what he does best - drops hardcore violent lyrics with so much hype and energy that hit yo' face as strong as Spice'1 fo-fo. The production is very  tight all over the album and producers include Bay Area's finest, names such as Paris, Ant Banks, Rick Rock and Mike  Mosley. The guest list is also VERY VERY impressive - Too Short, Ice T, WC, Big Syke, Mack 10 and others, make is a VERY special album. An awesome record makes you anticapate the next album by the  East Oakland thug - the one and only Spice - Mutha****in' 1!! This album is a classic, West Coast gangsta rap at it's highest form! I love the fact Spice 1 even made a tribute to 2Pac, and it's not one of those fake-a** tributes, by rappers that Pac never ever knew (and probably wouldn't even like to know) - Spice was real friends with Pac, and they worked together on several occasions, that's real. The album is close to perfection, even if his previous albums were a bit better. Spice steps his game up, and releases an album, with more of an up-to-date feel. I have nothing but good things to say about this one. Keep going Spice, you're a legend in this rap game. Late 1997, Spice 1 delivers us with his 5th album, and his 5th classic in a row.  Intact is his awesome wordplay and thuggish ruggish maniacal flow over great beats.  This album rates high in his discog.  Producers include Ant Banks, Paris, Clint ""Payback"" Sands, Hen Gee, Ali Malek, Rick Rock, Mike Mosley, and Femi Ojetunde, and the beats are a mix of syrupy and melodic G-Funk and mobb music.  Lyrically, he has a neat array of thug joints and a few deeper songs.  ""The Thug In Me"" is a nice dedication to late homie, 2Pac (RIP)over a melodic sample and whiny synth.  Spice fires the cheeba on ""I'm High"" over a heavier, more mobbish beat.  Spice 1 calls up WC and Big Syke from LA to kick some game about cali, the bay to LA anthem, 510, 213, named after major bay and LA area codes.  Spice 1 flosses a little, but still keeps it hard on ""Diamonds."" The beat is different, bass heavy, but softer on the foreground beat with a faint whiny synth.  ""The Boss Mobsta"" reminds me of 1995's ""Mind Of A Sick N---a,"" partly because the beat pattern is similar, a Whodini ""Friends"" Sample, and the lyrics and Spice's flow are crazy like in the 1995 joint. Ant Banks' beats on the banger street joints ""Recognize Game"" (f/ Too Short, Ice-T), and ""Fetty Chico And The Mack"" (f/Mack 10) are among the best on the album.  ""Down Payment On Heaven"" is awesome lyrically and musically too!  The beat has neat soulful samples to give it a laidback, melodic, and deep feel.  Spice 1 contemplates on life, death, and the things he has done, does, and may do.  The drama in the hood and senseless killings that take place there are emphasized in a intellectual fashion.  ""2 Hands And A Razorblade"" is another maniacal Spice 1 joint about life in the county jails of Cali.  The beat has a whiny riff reminiscent of Snoop Dogg's Murder Was The Case, but the beat is some slick G-Funk that is subtle but with hardcore overtures.  There is so much to like about this album.  Spice 1 ruled the 1990's, and this classic is a testament to that. This CD is pretty sick, Spice 1 puts it down. There arent too many great songs on this cd though, the 5 good ones are sick though. buy this only if you really like spice 1. spice 1's self titled debut in 1991 was a 'west coast geto boys' type album, menatally unbalanced rhymes but over LA funk. however his following three albums were less inspired, musically and lyrically.however in 1997 spice released this gem, his 5th album. for once he put together a top production team. the beats, mainly provided by paris, are deeply funky and catchy, and use low, heavy bass lines. for once spice doesn't let you down on the production tip and lyrically he's on good form.this album just flows together perfectly, classic groove after classic groove. spice took some time off after this album and has since become 'just another rapper' unfortunately. but this, along with his self titled debut, are his classics. I REALLY LIKE THE SOUND'S OF SPICE 1, JUST LIKE TOO SHORT THEY BOTH WILL TAKE YOU THERE DON'T FORGET IT'S RATED (R) IN MY BOOK!","Gangsta & Hardcore,Pop Rap,Rap & Hip-Hop,West Coast,Pop",cant f k speezy ace classic cd cant let go since first came called playas aint bumpin sh better get record store buy peace back believed hip hop changing previous two years bay area dishing hit hit artists like e click luniz short dangerous crew etc mostly around time due recent tragedies tupac biggie east coast west showing unity two regions although lp colab anyone west mostly northern southern california path followed ant banksbig thangsreleased year spice dropped gems well along time sixth black bossalini really comes real solid lp full gangsta tales something mostly heard past first easiest standout would th ace classic cd let let go came called better record store store buy peace believed hip hip hop hop changing previous years bay bay area area dishing hit hit artists click luniz short dangerous crew time recent tragedies biggie east east coast coast showing unity regions lp colab northern southern southern california california path followed ant year spice spice dropped dropped gems time sixth black black bossalini really comes real solid lp full gangsta tales heard past standout
220,441,B00000054J,"This album isn't to great. Only 2 maybe 3 tracks D-Shot raps in. If ya like R&amp;B you might like dis album because he sings a lot in Six Figures.  Check out his other 2 albums he gots out right now.  Both of the  other ones are reel good.  If you would like to contact me you can reach me  at yuckplace@hotmail.com. E-40's little brother is out there with his second solo album. This time, he's out of Sick Wid It records and he released it under his own label Shot Records. I loved his first one, and &quot;Six Figures&quot; is a bit better and quite different. First of all, D-Shot is the one who produced the album. And to tell you the truth I was quite amazed by his production abilities. I had no idea the boy had SO MUCH TALENT. His beats are awesome and I wish he produced for other people as well. His music is some of the best I've heard. Another difference is that on this album he features a lot of guest rappers to help him out. He may be out of Sick Wid It but he brought a lot of their players on his album and others too. Rappers featured are : E-40, B-Legit, Levitti, Suga T, Mr. Malik, Young Mugzi, Mac Shawn, Too $hort, Spice 1, G-Note... Quite an impressive list, isn't it? I loved all of them of course, but I wish D-Shot had more solo songs. 1 solo song out of 10 songs isn't enough. I think he IS a very good rapper and should've rapped more. But he preffered handling production and executig the record. The last difference from his debut is that on this one all the hook are by singers. But don't let that deter you! Because the hooks are VERY tight and take nothing from the songs! D-Shot should keep up with his label and keep putting such quality material out.","Gangsta & Hardcore,Pop Rap,Rap & Hip-Hop,West Coast,Pop",isnt great maybe shot raps ya like r amp b might like dis sings lot six figures check gots right ones reel good would like contact reach yuckplace hotmail com e little brother second solo time hes sick wid records released label shot records loved first one quot six figures quot bit better quite different first shot one produced tell truth quite amazed production abilities idea boy much talent beats awesome wish produced people well best ive heard another difference features lot guest rappers help may sick wid brought lot players others great maybe shot raps amp like dis sings lot figures check gots right right ones ones reel good like contact reach hotmail hotmail com com little brother brother second solo time sick records released label shot records loved quot figures bit better quite different shot produced tell truth quite amazed production abilities idea boy talent beats awesome wish produced people best heard difference features lot guest rappers help sick brought lot players
221,442,B00000054Y,"A good artist, IMHO, expands on what he already knows. Duarte could play blues-rock in his sleep, but here he chooses to go further. On this CD, he tries some sampling and R and B to go with his blues. It took me a few  listens to get into it. It's not as easily digestible as his debut. I think  his songwriting is an improvement and his guitar playing is as good as on  the first one. The playing here is more soulful than firery, and it's aslo  more in the service of the song. I takes a lot more listens to like this  one, but it's worth the effort. Chris has a much more &quot;funky&quot; feel on this CD. His first (texas sugar strat magic)showed what Chris is - one great guitar player. This just doesn't grab you like his first. It's not bad. I have both in my drawer at  work. When I go to listen to them, I pick his first 90% of the time. Parts  of it show a hint more Hendrix than SRV, but there seems to be a pinch of  Prince in here as well. I'm still waiting for Chris to come to Ohio. I  understand he is fantastic live. His web site is also cool with lots of  downloadable music. never got it,must have ran out or others orders in front of me. maybe next time. tell then, hope i come your way for a cd I got this one used for cheap, came in case with no scratches. Plus the case was fully in tact, which hardly ever happens to me. This album is very different from his first album, but none the less its good. It has a good mix of blues and rock. Crazy is a great blues shuffle with an awesome solo. Walls is a slower Hendrix style song, that picks up in the chorus. It has a cool solo with great tones throughout. Drivin' South is a cool Hendrix song that he covered on here, and Chris does a great job paying tribute to Jimi in this one. His cover of The Thrill Is Gone is different but good, it's got a synth sounding guitar riff, but it's a cool and different take on it. Cleopatra is one of my favorite CDG songs of all time. It has an awesome riff and it's just a great song in general.This album is not his best album, but it definitely has some great tracks and is worth every penny. He's a fantastic artist, guitar player, singer, and person. Support him by buying his music, he deserves it. Four words: the man can wail! Simple as that. Chris Duarte adds some funk to the blues, and proves to us that the guy can flat out wail. Cleopatra is a strong cut. He may not be Stevie, but he doesn't have to be. He's Chris. He proves on Tailspin Headwhack that the he can play that guitar his own way! I have yet to listen to his new release, but this one is a good buy. He may not be the best guitarist, but he's up there. One great blues player for the future. Chris Duarte, Tommy Castro, Walter Trout, Scott Holt-the future of blues is lookin' pretty good to me. A fine album by one of the funkiest men alive. Definitely a heavily rotated disc in my collection, but to truely appreciate Chris he has to be witnessed LIVE! Anyone who missed Hendrix or Clapton at the Flamingo or  Stevie Ray at the Continental should check him out to get a glimse of what  it was like. I recommend this and his first album Texas Sugar, Strat Magic  Highly! One of the top Blues/Rock guitarists going.  If you like SRV or guitar oriented music, then Chris is the man.  I saw him live in Ft Worth TX, and his magic is not performed just in the studio.  This is one talented  artist.  Buy this album now and thank me later! This may be the best Chris Duarte Group album - it's certainly the most original.  Chris spent a ton of studio time on this one experimenting with tape loops and rhythms - basically he wanted to do something FRESH in a world of tired old blues trios. He offers up an unbelievable cover of 'Thrill Is Gone' with looped drumbeats and nasty-funky-tasty guitar.  Cleopatra got quite a bit of air play as the first single from this album, but look to 'People Say' and 'Crimino' for the albums real strength of the CD - they sound like, well, no one - they sound like Chris Duarte.  There are sprinkles of Stevie in here... .32 blues is definitely in that vein.  'Drvin South' is the closest thing you'll ever get to seeing Chris live - relentless, in-your-face, over-the-top, make your ears bleed guitar explosion.  Well worth the purchase price. To paraphrase my brother, who is a both a devoted guitarist and a devoted student of many playing styles (from D'Jango to Jimi), Chris Duarte manages to combine influences from many, many other fine artists and yet retains his own unique style. His music ranges from straight-ahead kick-... rock to liquid, buttery-smooth jazz, blues and soul. If you expect ANY of his albums to be consistent and uneclectic, forget it. If, however, you delight in amazing, incindiary, surprising and listenable ear-candy, ALL of Duarte's work is a treat.While you're at it, look him up on the Web and plan on seeing him in concert. I did, at some little biker dive in Topeka, KS. Spent most of the time there in slack-jawed amazement at him and his band. God only knows how Duarte wrenches so of the music he gets out of that strat, but it's well worth hearing.This album and it's predecessors are more polished versions of the Duarte magic. I highly recommend you spend a few $$$ and buy them. Your ears will thank you. This guy owes a heck of a lot  to Jimi Hendrix and even more so to Stevie Ray Vaughn's take on Hendrix. But, hey, you could have worse influences...right ? On his second recording &quot;Tailspin Headwhack&quot; (what a great name) Chris Duarte plays some incindiary and inspired stuff.On his first release, Austin ,Texas native Duarte managed to meld Stevie Ray and the Red Hot Chili Peppers into a great, funky album.Though generally danceable this one's not quite as funked up, opting for a more soul searching,brooding sound. It comes off quite well indeed,and I think this one's better. The poppish &quot;Cleopatra&quot; leads off with distortion laden guitar over a nice groove. Chris does the lead vocals here as well and his voice matches his music perfectly.At this point the show start's to ignite. Ther'es a soulful rendition of B.B. King's &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot; and an excellent update of the Meter's &quot;People Say&quot;. The rest are mostly originals and run from the rockin' &quot;Drivin' South&quot; to the the more introspective and psychedelic sounding &quot;Walls&quot;. Also noteworthy is the title cut which also sounds like something from the  &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; sessions. Ditto for the sultry&quot;.32 Blues&quot;, with superlative Hammond work from former SRV bandmate Reese Winans. The band is always right on the mark, confident and rock solid.  A solid offering, &quot;Tailspin Headwhack&quot;, is an easy disc to throw on almost anytime and I can't think how anybody couldn't get caught up in this swamp- rocker groove. From start to finish, this CD will rock your world! Chris Duarte is like Stevie Ray Vaughan reincarnated! Highly recommended.DwightSacramento, CA What a disappointmnt this release is.  &quot;Texas Sugar...&quot; was so refreshing and then Chris released this pile of rubble.  Most of the original material is shockingly bad and the cover treatments should be a  felony.  Chris deserves a whack in the head for trashing &quot;The Thrill  Is Gone&quot; and &quot;Drivin' South.&quot;  He is very talented so the  future still looks bright even after this disasterous release. Without a doubt, the production raises the level of this cd several notches above his first yet ironicaly, he doesnt match the kind of pyrotechnics he showed on &quot;shelo&quot; on that same disc, with his rendition here of &quot;driving south&quot; a huge dissapointment and his vocal range still woefully short of adequate, in most places, the only redeeming factor here is the sense that wonderful things are possible from this guy, on a few of the songs i can start to hear the beginnings of a signature sound that is quite inspiring.it could be that no album has yet captured the fullness of the chris duarte experience for I hear only great things from anyone who has seen him live and he plays,at times, with a wonderful recklessness that would be a joy to see and is a pleasure to listen to. i will buy his third cd also,in due time,as the guy has my keen attention about where he is going to take his considerable talent. worth a listen or three, leave the expectations for greatness in the store and enjoy the presence of great potential, id love to see a concert...... This guy is an awesome talent.  He is best heard live....none of his cd's have ever done him justice.

222,443,B000000550,"When you need to be refreshed, listen to the melody and lyrics of this album. It is spiritual bringing the person to an intimate time with the creator. It allows an atomsphere of the presence of the King tocome and fill the space surrounding you. I just wrote a review for &#34;if i left the zoo&#34; which is jars' third album. much afraid is the 2nd. its in my opinion on par with the other albums i own by Jars. whether its their newsest album &#34;inland&#34; or the first self titled one or the 11th hour, all these albums have somethign wonderful to offer. I still plan on buying the other 5 or more albums they've created including the Christmas ones but i have to admit that each album makes me happy I bought it. especially the track &#34;much afraid&#34; is such a masterpiece ive played it over and over again. Dave Matthews is my other favorite for many years i was obbessed with the music of DMB but now as a comited Christian I need a more wholesome and holy message to listen to now and then if not most of the time. This album is wonderful! It's a great sound. Though nothing can come close to their first album this runs a very near second. Check it out! When I bought this album years ago,  I, as many others at the time, was expecting a second Flood. Also like many at the time, I was disapointed of the new sound, but it did not take long to find an album that was more creative, dynamic, mature, meaningful as a whole, and a that evoked a completely rich listening experience. This is today my favorite album from Jars of Clay, and probably the one that stands as the most special for me for music in general. I have for years been critical and skeptical of Christian music, especially the main CCM acts or those that are usually labelled as such; but Jars of Clay has proven authentic artistic quality, writing sincere words and images that are not there to accomplish a religious task. This is an album that I enjoy from beginning to end, evey single track. This is detailed, careful writing and musical composing that comes together perfectly. Even if the overall appearance of the music feels mellow and sad, the emotional effect of the cd after a listen is rather uplifting. It evokes a certain peace combined with humilty that eases the mind. A great album not to be compared to any of their other works. I don't know how you could compare this to the debut and say it's not as good.  All songs with the possible exception of Five Candles (which is somewhat annoying) are pretty excellent.  Aside from one or two lyrics that made me cringe (the ladder rung one in Crazy Times, namely) the CD's near flawless.  Grab it. Yet, it doesn't hold a candle to the debut, and I find &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot; to be more colorful in sound as well as quality.Still though, &quot;Much Afraid&quot; has much to offer! Don't be fooled!Lyrics are a major plus, and there is a nice, warm mix of accoustics as well as plugged in sound! The change in musical style is a refreshing insight, though not as great as their older stuff we all know and still love! &quot;Hymn&quot; the last song on this album is the most poetic and beautiful offering i've heard from them thus far. That is what I've always loved about this band, is how they always manage to serve up great music along with beautifully painted lyrics! &quot;Overjoyed&quot;, &quot;Crazy Times&quot; (possibly the best one on here), &quot;Fade To Grey&quot;, and &quot;Five Candles&quot; are easy radio hits and &quot;Weighed Down&quot; adds thought to the action of the flow of the music. Though this album isn't near as good as their original stuff, it still has some very good tunes on here, and provides a good mix of wonder and refreshing beats to jam to.... The music: This CD is one of the few I have that I listen to all the way through without skipping any tracks. From the #1 Overjoyed to the #11 Hymn, each song features talented guitar, piano, harmony, and background additions, as well as beautifully written lyrics full of hidden meanings. Though initially this disk may seem colorless due to the band's unfailing consistency, it only improves with repetition. I have encountered few bands able to create poetry the way Jars Of Clay can, and never fail to enjoy their pensive, thoughtful style.The booklet: A bare bones fifteen page little affair with clearly printed lyrics and a couple of photographs. Nothing stunning, but it gets the job done.The artists: For several years Jars Of Clay was my favorite band and I was excited to see them in 1999 at the Inside Out Soul Festival in New Hampshire. They got a prime evening slot and made the most of it. Supplemented by a couple of backup guys on bass and drums, they entertained a packed crowd with both boisterous rock and quiet contemplation. One of my favorite memories is listening to Steve (I think he's the one, though I'm no longer positive) testing his microphone. Instead of saying &quot;One, too, three&quot; and so forth, he yelled out &quot;For breakfast I ate lunch!&quot; and &quot;Shave!&quot; All told a bunch of fun, open guys making the most of their talent and bringing good music to a lot of people.In summary: While perhaps not Jars's best effort, there is little I can find to dislike about Much Afraid. Great poetic lyrics and reflective music from an awesome band. All I can say is this cd is AMAZING...every since the day I've gotten it I listen to this...Chrisitan or not you can appreciate this...AMAZING>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> By far my favourite JOC Cd. With its very catchy tunes and easy-on-the-ears songs, this CD is a must for any JOC fan, OR for any music lovers collection. a lot of people have complained about this one, but i think it's definitely one of the best they've made. people complain about this one being too overproduced, but actually it was the first JOC cd that altered his voice a lot, making it sound more ""manly"" and less ""airy"", which was a bad idea. dan haseltine's voice is so unique.. it almost has an eerie feel to it. they definitely did a good job in this cd by preserving the natural timbre of his voice.also, the lyrical content is so thick and poetic. musically, it took some time for some songs to grow on me like five candles and fade to grey, but eventually they did. some gems are songs like hymn, portrait of an apology, tea and sympathy, and frail. my goodness, frail's lyrics are so intense..if i was not so weak/ if i was not so cold/ if i was not so scared of being broken growing old/ i would be frailwow. an accurate summary of christianity: to be frail and broken before God is to be strong. you will appreciate this cd for its well-thought out lyrics and its musicianship. Jars of Clay's first album was spectacular and can never be equalled again. But their sophmore release did not dissappoint me either. MUCH AFRAID is richer musically and experiments a lot more than the first album  did. All of the songs are constructed very well and have thoughful lyrics  to go along with them. The song &quot;FRAIL&quot; sticks out of the bunch  as being mesmerizing, very deep, and conveying the truth. This CD is a truly work of art.  Every song is fine-crafted and worked to near perfection.  The writing is brilliant, and the music is beautiful.  This is definitely the best Jars CD.  The other two are both excellent but fall short of the level of Much Afraid.  Every song is wonderful and worth hearing again and again.  The whole album flows perfectly from beginning to end.  The music is varied in style but consistent in its amazing quality.  Truly a must-own album! This was one of the first Jars of Clay CDs I had the pleasure of listening to after I became a fan of the band a few months ago. They are truly amazing, and despite the critics and such, I think they did pretty well with &quot;Much Afraid.&quot; It's not only a statement concerning the Christian faith in general, it's a very personal reflection on the band's feelings about reaching out to a secular world with a message of faith and hope. From what Jars has said in interviews they were very &quot;much afraid&quot; to make a follow up to their smash hit self-titled debut because they were mocked by the secular music audience for being too preachy and then scorned by the Christian audience for not being preachy enough...so through rough times, bouts of depression and a passion for Jesus Christ, Jars of Clay wrote some of the most honest, spiritual, poetic and overall some of the best music i've heard from them yet on &quot;Much Afraid.&quot; The stand out tracks (in my opinion) are &quot;Crazy Times&quot; which is a painful reminder of the reality of heartache, &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; a great observation of a self-serving society, &quot;Frail&quot; a beautiful depiction of humility and &quot;Truce&quot; which is the most eccentric song on the album. Most have blamed the band's third album &quot;If I Left the Zoo&quot; for being the moodiest and the darkest album they've released. However, &quot;Much Afraid&quot; perfectly encompasses a season of despair and confusion, while still reminding us to keep faith. Great music with a powerful message... I love this CD!! I understand that their first CD was awesome, but this CD is great in its own right.""Frail"" is hauntingly attractive, and I love ""Crazy Times"",""Tea and Sympathy"",etc.In fact, the first seven songs are great in my opinion.The whole CD is really good, and I highly recommend it!! After a triple-platinum debut, the Jars enter a bit more electric, but still the best Christian aternative band out there. Crazy Times, Overjoyed. are simply exquisite. This album came out with a lot of expectations, escpecially in the Christian community.  Everyone wanted to see another secular chart topper, and I think people were disapointed with it due to to lower album sales before even listening to the music.  This album is DEFINATELY Jars, and DEFINATELY awesome.  The title song from their original demo &quot;Frail&quot; is finally released, and now with lyrics and is one of the best songs on the CD.  It contains a lot of great strings sections.  Another great song on the CD is &quot;Much Afraid&quot; which was inspired by the allegory &quot;Hind's Feet on High Places&quot; by Hannah Hurnard.  The rest of the album is great and not a single song is disapointing.  If you are a dissapointed Jars of Clay fan, please try this album.  And if you loved the first one, you'll love this one too. This CD is wonderful. I was addicted to the first Jars CD and now this one. Each one of their songs are so different so it's like listening to the same song over and over just with different words. Their paradox of strings  with the tradtional rock band electric gitaurs and drumms is truly unquie  and they pull it off quite well.  HOwever there is no hidden jam session as  there was on the fisrt CD but there is a bonus.  When the CD is loading  into your computer it links you to there home page throung this interactive  media installed on the CD.  I highly recomend this band for people of all  faiths becuase I belive everyone is able to enjoy it. Jars of Clay are well know in and out of the Christian music industry.  What has made them so popular is their Accoustic sound mixed with various other instruments.  Their lirics are also well developed making for a great group.  But When success hit a group it may go to their heads.  That is why, in my opinion, the follow up to their debut record, Much Afraid, isn't as well written or developed.  It seems as if with their fame with Flood, from their first record, that they may have commercialized their new C.D.  Never-the-less, Much Afraid is some what characteristic of Jars of Clay's work.  It has upbeat songs and slow songs depending on your mood, but has gotten away from its &quot;roots&quot;.  So if interested in more Jars of Clay, This would be a bad C.D. to look into, but don't expcect the superior quality you may have experienced with their earlier work. &quot;Much Afraid&quot; is my favorite album to date! The tracks are all uplifting and if not for anything, I'd say very personal. The shine comes through the tracks of the tearful &quot;Tea And Sympathy&quot; and the very young sounding Dan Haseltine in &quot;Five Candles&quot;. They take a familiar step in the religious &quot;Hymn&quot;, very beautiful. I have this album, with the extra tracks such as a remix of &quot;Flood&quot; and the mysterious &quot;The Chair&quot;. All the tracks in the album is very well written by the band and are all quality songs. I have three of the albums include &quot;If I Left The Zoo&quot; and &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;. All the albums made by this band are all meant to touch people's lives and I'm one of them! Jars of Clay takes lots of risk on this album, mostly by giving a product that commercially makes them seem like they're selling out.  While there are two songs which seem just made for the radio, &quot;Tea and  Symphony&quot; and &quot;5 Candles&quot; (&quot;Crazy Times&quot; is  catchy, but how could they forsake such an excellant song?), the album as a  whole is an excellant effort, melodic, varying and lyrically interesting.  Though some lyrics are not straight forward, each song has a powerful  meaning.  If you're wondering, &quot;Tea and Symphony&quot; is about  unfaithfulness (according to the band)--its not all that cryptic, but why  should all the lyrics be handed to the listener, come on! that would be  senseless and boring!  This album is very powerful and is highlighted by  &quot;Fade to Grey&quot;.  (Unless you blast that song, you won't feel it  --Try it.)  &quot;Hymn&quot;  is a very daring attempt that shines  brilliantly.  -&gt;Name another band that goes to the trouble and risk of  writing a hymn for the modern audience and does an incredible job--its an  AWESOME song.  The rest of the album is some of the best in alternative out  there and shows that Jars of Clay is expanding their musicality greatly.  This album is also very well produced, every song is a work of art and it  is apparent that Jars put a lot of time and thought into it.  Jars of Clay  has done a great job writing an album that will make the non-Christian  consider the lyrical content rather than turn a deaf ear.  This album  shines the light of God's Glory in its careful subtlety and musical  awesomness.  Christian musicians CAN be talented!--its about time someone  started breaking the barriers and very negative streotype of Christian  Rock!  Thanks, Jars, for taking the risks God has inspired in you!  (ps. I  would have given you five stars if had a bass player:)) Following their double platinum success, there was a lot of pressure for the band to follow up with an equally invotative album.So with their second release Jars took the music up a notch, yet managed to keep their original acoustic sound. The moment you hear the first few strums you will tell things have changed. Gone are the drum loops and in come drums and electric guitars.However this is still definetly Jars of Clay, and at their very best.""Fade to Grey"" was one such highlight, and possible the best song on the album. The organ and guitars work wonderfully together like nothing you've heard. With vocals nothing sort of spectacular, and harmonies that match the Beach Boys. This is followed by ""Tea and Sympathy"", which both lyrically and musically is out of this world. Just listen to the lyrics, strings and Haseltine's vocals and you will want more.Listening to this album is like hearing one gem after another. ""Frail"" is both emotionally and musically masterful. Dealing with mans pride and constant weakness and the need for God's strength. The acoustic guitars and vocals are again spectacular.Other highlights include ""Crazy Times"". A heavyier song, yet extremely radio friendly and ""Portrait Of An Apology"".Much Afraid is a joy to listen to, probably the bands best to date! This is a CD that should be added to any Christian CD collection. The lyrics are deep and thought-provoking. And the music has a definate style and grace. My two favorite songs from the CD are &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; and &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;. I had never heard of this band before my SO brought this CD into our house, and now it's one of my most regular listenings. Few bands I'll buy their other albums based on hearing just one -- this is one of them. The  music is good and the lyrics great too, even for someone like me who isn't  too religious. I now have all 3 Jars albums in my possession and I am totally pleased with ALL of them!  The each have a unique sound that sets them apart from other albums in the music industry today.  For MUCH AFRAID, i can  definitely say that i love it.  It, along with the 2 other releases by  Jars, are probably permanently stuck in my Stereo.  Outstanding lyrics,  that are NOT confusing, and intriguing sound!  Must HAVE! This is the kinda cd that most ppl. either really like, or don't like at all. Personally, I think it's Jars best work. With a reputation for deep poetic lyrics, this Jars of Clay cd is certainly no exception. In fact, I think they go lyrically deeper here than on either of their other two works ('Jars of Clay' &amp; 'If I Left The Zoo'). This is guitar driven alternative christian rock at it's best, but don't let that title lull you into thinking this may be music that's over the edge....it's quite the contrary. 'Much Afraid' really has a folk-rock kind of feel, with songs ranging from lively &amp; kicking to soft &amp; contemplative. They end the cd with a beautiful worship song. The way they write their lyrics makes you listen longer and harder for the 'meaning.' I find the deeper I must dig, the more I want to know. Of course, the whole message of this recording is Christ-centered and it's range in emotion is variable, but good. It's a real honest look at life. I think most everyone can relate to their songs. I really connected with this cd and most especially w/ the title song, &quot;Much Afraid,&quot; &quot;Tea &amp; Sympathy,&quot; and &quot;Crazy Times.&quot; Overall, I found this to be honest music, with some great guitar &amp; drum work. Their self titled debut album, 'Jars of Clay' is also good and so is 'If I Left The Zoo.' Each just has a different tone. Personally, I listen to 'Much Afraid' the most often. If you like music that has depth, or if you're looking for some really good alternative christian rock, then this should satisfy your taste. It did mine. After a stunning debut, Jars of Clay's sophomore CD goes somewhat of a different route, opting for more overdubbed tracks, and less of the drum machine. The result is an album that is better in my opinion. Many sonic  textures exist, ranging from the orchestration in the sober ""Frail"", to the  harder edges of first single ""Crazy Times"". In between, a variety of high  points shine, including a folk-ish gem, (""Hymn""), pure pop songs, (""Five  Candles"", ""Tea and Sympathy""), and subdued ballads, (the title track,  ""Portrait of an Apology""). The lavish outro harmonies of ""Tea and Sympathy""  turn a typical pop tune into something very pleasant to listen to. The  thoughtful, slight-dance rhythm of ""Truce"" is quite intriguing, and the  seemingly rhetorical ""Weighed Down"" recalls the first album's hidden song.  At first glance, the album seems to lack musical coherence, but the quality  of each song helps unite them all together, despite some noticeable  experimentation. ""Much Afraid"" takes the band's talents, as evidenced in  the first record, and adds many layers of musical color, creating a  brilliant collection of songs. There were a lot of people who bought this album and were disappointed - because they expected it to be like the first album - well this one is radically different.  The first one, in general is quite upbeat, this one is a lot mellower, much more introspective, possibly somewhat sad - but it is one of my favorite albums that I've ever owned.  I've found that much of satisfaction has to do with what you expect.  My favorite tracks are Tea and Sympathy, Weighed Down, Overjoyed, and Crazy Times. this album may sound a little different from the first because of less acoustic-driven songs in it but this is a great cd to listen to. it has all the aspect of jars' music that you're looking for from their debut album both lyrically and spiritually. songs such as &quot;five candles&quot;,&quot;tea &amp; sympathy&quot;&amp;&quot;crazy times&quot; proves that joc has done a good job in this sophomore effort!! A great album! Many CD's only have a few listenable or memorable songs, but nearly every one on &quot;Much Afraid&quot; is a winner. I especially enjoy the song &quot;Fade to Grey.&quot; It is very obvious as you listen to this CD why it won a Grammy... the  Jars come through again with a CD filled with songs that are destined to  become favorites.  The acoustic-style melodies and haunting lyrics that are  typical of the Jars' style is taken to yet another level in this sophomore  album.  A must have -- I highly  recommend it to anyone who enjoys music  with depth and meaning. now, i now that i am going to tick off more than a few people with his one, but, oh well... after the first jars album, i was really looking forward to this after hearing the ep.  i got it and i was truly  dissapointed.  it reminds me of dire straits or duran duran (something of  that nature -- the whole 80's rock vibe).  anyway, the songs &quot;crazy  times&quot; and &quot;frail&quot; stand out.  the rest of the tracks are  just crap.  whatever happened to the band that wrote achingly beautiful  acoustic ballads?  sure, they changed, but was it for the better?  my bet  is that it wasn't.  get the first cd.  it is much better. This is a another high quality CD from Jars of Clay. Althoughsome might consider this a failure in regards to the sucess of thefirst album. I personally don't see it that way. This album has goneplatinum (although not multi-platinum like the first abum) and soundsincredible. Once again they show that they can write deep meaningfulsongs. Though the Jars this time have drifted away from the acousticroots and has expanded their horizons musically.  Some people don'tlike the new sound and consider them to have &quot;sold out&quot; butI don't see it that way. If they truely &quot;sold out&quot; then theywould have stuck with what works, acoustic pop. They decided to growas musicians and artists and created this CD. It hardly soundsanything like thier debut CD. You can tell there is more productionand refinement. The music is more defined and the vocals areclearer. They have very tight background vocals on this one andbrighter sounding intruments. They also included electric guitar onmany of their songs.  I enjoy this very much and love seeing Jars ofClay's development and maturity through their records. The songs arewell written, catchy and easy to listen to. Don't expect anythingexactly like the first album and you will like this very much. the jars of clay cd is the best cd i have ever owned, i even bought 2 of them in case one gets a scratch, no one has their guitar skills, they are one of the few groups that actully play their own instruments, (newsboys do  to but they stink at it) i highly recomend this cd, to anyone that enjoys  music Ever had an insatiable urge to receive a CD?  Well, it happened with this CD.  And the risk of not liking it was well worth it.  This CD is incredible!  I remember recieving it Martin Luther King Day, and not more  than 48 hours later, I had the self-titled in my possession.  Why did I get  the first one?  Not because the second CD sucked, but because Jars of Clay  managed to do two completely different sounds very well.  Get both, and  enjoy both for their different, but incredible sounds.  God Bless. ...and also one of the top 20 albums of the last decade. Period. It is truly a buried treasure. I have read many reviews on this album questioning it's worth with the other Jars of Clay works,even by Jars of Clay themselves.In my opinion,this album has their most powerful lyrics encased with some of their best music  lay-out, showing their maturaty.From the soft beat of  'Much Afraid' to the  rock sound of 'Truce' this album has something for everyone.There's no  denying that everytime I hear the last track (Hymn) I can feel the presence  of the Lord inside my soul.I hope I've helped someone to see the value of  Much Afraid along with their debut and If I Left the Zoo.God Bless,JF.com Jars of Clay rock!!! &quot;Much Afraid&quot; differs from &quot;jars of  clay&quot;, their debut album, though both are Christian rock/alternative.  In &quot;Much Afraid&quot;, the lyrics are subtle, and it may take the  listener several times through to grasp the entire meaning (which is  definitely a good thing!)&quot;Overjoyed&quot;, relates the humility of the  true Christian walk. &quot;Crazy Times&quot;, my personal favorite, tells  the tale of a stray Christian reaching rock bottom and calling out to God;  the hard rock matches the lyrics perfectly. &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; is  a little too &quot;pop&quot; for such a sophisticated mix, but  &quot;Hymn&quot; makes up for it with absolutely beautiful lyrics and a  soft touch. Even though this album is different from the first, the  diversity only exemplifies the group's many talents. I had heard of Jars of Clay in 1995-1996 and even had their debut album, but it wasn't until I saw Jars of Clay live in 1997 that I realized what a truly great band they were. They were promoting their new album, ""Much Afraid"", when I saw them in concert. I didn't own ""Much Afraid"" at the time so I wasn't familiar with the newer material, but a song that Jars of Clay sang that night stuck with me. I bought ""Much Afraid"" after the concert and when track #3 started playing, I quickly realized this was the song that struck a chord with me that night - Tea and Sympathy. It quickly became my favorite Jars of Clay song, and it remains my favorite to this day.I have seen Jars of Clay two more times since then and have bought all of their records, including their newest masterpiece, ""Good Monsters."" Jars of Clay's music has always been new, exciting, and relevant. They know how to reinvent themselves musically yet be true and fresh lyrically with each album that they put out.""Much Afraid"" will always hold a special place in my heart because this album is truly what made me a fan of the band. I don't regard this album as their personal best overall, but I do think that Tea and Sympathy is one of the best songs they have ever put on any album. That song makes this album shine. Other favorites of mine from this album are Fade To Grey, Crazy Times, and Portrait of an Apology. Jars of Clay's first album was an instant hit, &quot;Flood&quot; becoming a number one video on MTV.  Their sophomore set, &quot;Much Afraid&quot;, is even better!  The steadfast lyrics are the punch in the diverse acoustic  styles displayed throughout the album.  From the &quot;pop&quot; sound of  &quot;Fade to Grey&quot; to the worshipful, predominantly instrumental song  &quot;Frail&quot; to the smash hit rock song &quot;Crazy Times&quot; (the  #1 song that topped charts, allowing its appearance on WoW'99), Jars of  Clay has truly outdone the first album.  &quot;Stringtown&quot; doesn't  even compete with this awesome-sounding album.  Acoustics, percussion, and  compelling lyrics are prevalent throughout the entire CD.  I would advise  any acoustic rock fanatic to buy &quot;Much Afraid&quot;.  I believe you  would find it beyond satisfying.  You can't get much better than this! i lost this album a few years back. It's cool that I could find a copy with the seatbelt tuba CD with it to replace omy first copy! Thanks seller and Amazon! I have been a fan of the jars since their first album. ive seen them preform three times, and even met them once. This CD, though it used to be my least favorite of the jars, is based on the classic HINDS FEET ON HIGH  PLACES by H annah Hurnard. it is the story of Much Afraid as she flees from  her relatives the Fearings to make a journey with the shepard(Jesus) to the  high places to become like a hind or a deer. It is an allegory about  becoming a christian and letting Christ overcome our physical, spiritual,  and emotional limitations. It is not only this that makes the CD great, it  is the superb voice of Dan Haseltine, combined with some awesome guitar  work by Steve Mason, great bass by Matt Odemark and the keyboarding of the  professor Charlie Lowell. the best cuts are crazy times, truce, fade to  grey, and five candles There are a lot of different opinions not only of this album, but of JoC completely.  The controversy of their waivering style is definitely common among fans.  I'm not sure of their true reasons for doing it other than perhaps they wanted to keep shocking their fans, or simply, maybe that's just where they wanted to go musically.  Either way, it was not as successful as they wanted it to be.I am a hardcore fan of the first album and the first album's unique alternative-acoustic style that was untouched and has been untouched for the last 7 years.  Traces of this first-album style is seen in the MUCH AFRAID album in songs like 'Tea and Symphony', 'Five Candles', 'Portrait of an Apology', 'Much Afraid' and 'Hymn'.  'Wieghed Down' is just a remix of '4:7' in my opinion, and 'Frail' and 'Fade to Grey' were songs off their original independent record, therefore, the old style completely.  But it seems they wanted a little more upbeat sound for this album and ventured into it with a real drummer (instead of drum-tracks) and spruced it with electric guitars: 'Crazy Times', 'Overjoyed', 'Fade to Grey'.If your looking for an album that has the same style as their first, you will be slightly disappointed.  However, this is the closest album of them all to the amazing sound of the first.  But there is hope!  The Jars have released many singles that are EXACTLY the songs that they should have put on there other albums:  'The Chair', 'Rose Colored Stain Glass Windows', 'River Constantine' (which is actually on their third cd), 'The Stone', 'Needful Hands', 'This Road', 'The Coffee Song', 'If I Stand' (Rich Mullins), 'Fly Farther', 'The Widowing Field' and all the songs on their Christmas Cd.  I recommend getting ahold of all these, you WILL luv them as much as you luv the first record.Point and Case, if you are a die-hard Jars Fan you should own all four cds.  If not, get this one, and don't worry about the rest. &quot;Much Afraid&quot; sold so well, because it followed their terrific debut, but fans disappointed by this album may be less likely to buy a third. Jars of Clay's original c.d. will endure as one of Christian music's landmark events.  From beginning to end, the sound on that album is unique, fresh, and invigorating, and the lyrics are compelling. I can't say the same about this sophomore project.  I think this album is intended to have more valleys than peaks, because it has such a somber quality. I consider &quot;Frail,&quot; &quot;Much Afraid,&quot; and &quot;Hymn&quot; the best songs on the album.  Just when I begin to enjoy &quot;Overjoyed,&quot; the song is finished. &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; and &quot;Five Candles&quot; make no sense to me. I'm bothered by the apparent implication that &quot;everything is relative&quot; in &quot;Fade to Grey&quot;, because its not true and it contradicts the message sent by the songs on their first album, especially &quot;Li! quid,&quot; &quot;World's Apart,&quot; and &quot;Blind&quot; that each demonstrate our absolute need for Christ. Having owned this album for six months now, I'm much more likely to listen to their first album. In interviews, Jars of Clay said that they weren't going to try to live up to their first album, because that would be impossible.  Well, nothing is impossible with Christ.  While &quot;Much Afraid&quot; does not live up to the expectations set by their debut, it does demonstrate their musical creativity and lyrical genius.  I have no doubt that they will be able to keep and fully utilize the platform erected for them by their first album in years to come.  I'll give them one more shot before writing them off. Out of the three Jars cd's, this one is the best!  Different from their debut, it is musically superior; each song is worth listening to.  Frail is an absolutely beautiful song; Fade to Grey is also one of my favorites.  If  you're looking for a carbon copy of their first cd, then you will be  disappointed.  If you're wanting a satisfying musical experience, then Much  Afraid is for you! Though this album came out ten years ago, it's my favorite Jars album.  I have been sadly disappointed with all of the albums following this one, but it could be because I'm holding them to the standard of 'Much Afraid'!Dan Haseltine has a remarkable way of writing lyrics that are not-so-obvious in their direction, which is why I believe they have so many non-Christian fans.  But his lyrics are also well written and interlaced with excellent guitar playing and emotion, it's hard to miss the talent of this band.From 'Weighed Down' to 'Crazy Times' to my favorite, 'Truce', I'm going to rank this album in my top 20.  And I have A LOT of CDs.  :) Jars Of Clay's music has got true art written all over it. Dan Haseltine's (lead vocals) clear vocals make the songs jump at you. Jars have the ability to carry you with their songs. Their musical prowess is extremely  refined (just have a look at their chord progressions in the songs!). I  can't believe it took me 1 year to discover them after their previous debut  album. They defined their own genre of music that to my experience has been  unmatched! Truly my favourite band. Check it out to see how it could be  yours! Gotta have it! Even when I really think a CD is great I will read the negative reviews. And I must say many of the reviews that I read were pretty shallow in their own right. Even though I have kids that are probably the same age as many of the reviewers, I really enjoy JARS OF CLAY. I will admit that when I first heard this CD I did not enjoy it as much as their other two projects, but this CD has really grown on me. For me, their conviction for truth and their passion for holy things come through.  While I really enjoy every track on MUCH AFRAID I would have to say, ""Tea and Sympathy"" is my favorite. The reviewers a fore mentioned are certainly entitled to their own opinions, but for me personally this CD brings me MUCH ENJOYMENT. One of the greatest albums not just in the Christian genre, but in the history of music!! Timeless and classic!!! I bought this CD a year and a half ago. I have to be honest when I say that the first time I listened to this album, I didn't like it. It was so different from thier first one. But later, it totally grew on me, and it is  still one of my favorite and most treasured CD's. They matured so much in  thier music, lyrics, and faith, it just blows me away. I really learned to  appreciate it's full value. You should buy it, but don't give up on it if  you don't like it at first, just keep listening, and you'll find the  beautiful secret. For those of you who have trouble understanding the lyrics jarsofclay are just try to sell their albums to secular and Christain stations. For example &quot;Crazy Times&quot; is a very cool song for everyone. But if  your a Christain you can see the message in the song. The fact that in our  Walk with the Lord it can seem like the crazy times.  If you buy  this album buy the other one too. The first one is more acoustic and a good  message, but the second is more 'rocky' and is for everybody. So read the  lyrics and think about them then you&quot;ll under stand. JESUS LOVES U!!! This is one of the worst cd's in Christian music history. The lyrics are terrible to try and understand, and they have no good drums, no good guitar, and are just plain terrible. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. UNLESS YOU LOVE  THE KIND OF MUSIC I JUST TALKED ABOUT, YOU WILL HATE THIS CD. I SWEAR! GO  GET SOMETHING BY THE NEWSBOYS, IF YOU WANT A GOOD CD. CAUSE THAT IS WHAT  THIS ONE DEFINATELY IS NOT! THANK YOU!!!! This album is great.  If you heard Jars of Clay's debut album, this album  is a little more rockish/alternative.  But it is still eqousticly centered.  There are also a few really great ballads if your not totaly into  &quot;harder&quot; music.  If you like sixpence, smalltown poets, or  caedman's call then you'll definatly like this CD. Another fantastic effort by this outstanding band.  'Nuff said Much Afraid has to be one of Jars of Clay's best albums to date. Each song has so much expression. Much Afraid is timeless, In 2007, the album will be ten years old and the songs will never become outdated. Jars of Clay are a genius group, I know each track had to be ahead of Its time. I think It may have been overwhelming for some, but Much Afraid is a very deep album. From the start when I first heard  Crazy times, Fade to Gray, Frail and Truce, I was hooked. These are the songs that become timeless. I think Jars of Clay has broken the barriers of conventional music and ingenious composition. Simply fantastic. Acoustic vibes team up with alternative rock to create a distinct, unique and well crafted sound. The people who give low reviews to this album are the ones who don't understand its greater musical and lyrical implications. This is fine, but it serves to be a matter of one's personal preference, not the fact that the music isn't well made, well written or absolutely fantastic in its own respects. I consider this album to be the greatest in all of Jars of Clay's discography. The themes of the songs are more mature, the actual songs themselves are more well written and vary to great degree. No song sounds like another, no song is out of place and ALL of the songs are fantastic! Lot's of different key signatures and moods are captured in this album. The first album is primarily comprised of C minor, G major and a few songs in C major. But in this album, LITERALLY almost EVERY song is in a different key signature, has different tempo's and progressions to them. Originality is huge in this album as well and emotions are well captured within the songs in the lyrical sense. Not only are all of these things contributors of the albums legacy, but so also is its overall feel. Many Jars of Clay albums after this one didn't capture the variety, the originality and craft that the band exemplified in this album. Even from the simplest of things such as the more raw feel and sound (definitely something that came with the times though,) to even the actual songs that really stick with you, bringing in me a certain nostalgia for the good ol' days of Christian contemporary music (which I can safely say is DEAD in this modern day.) The later albums by Jars of Clay never quite captured what ""Much Afraid"" had already perfected. I can honestly say for the most part, I really wouldn't call myself a huge Jars of Clay ""fan."" This album is truly their only one that I enjoy in its entirety. If any of you like the sound of well thought out alternative rock with acoustic vibes and influences, I highly recommend this album. From a musical standpoint, it stands up to many of my secular favorites from the 90's and certainly blows their Christian counterparts out of the water. Absolutely fantastic album in all standpoints. I highly recommend it, unless all you look for is the mindless music that simply pleases the masses. This isn't for those who simply want a catchy beat, those who could care less about interesting chord progressions and those who don't have any desire to identify depth in the lyrical content. This might be my favorite Christian album of all time... Give it a listen. My belief is that Jars of Clay fans probably know less about this CD than any other - a definite problem!  The guys came through with another thought-provoking high quality CD, with the usual interesting music and variety unlike most other groups.  Definitely highly recommended! When I first got this CD, I didn't like it. But it grew on me. Each time I played it, I came to like it a little more. The songs on this disc have a real depth (spiritual and musical) to them. Some of my favorites include  the introspective &quot;fade to grey,&quot; the soul-searching  &quot;frail,&quot; the prayerful &quot;weighed down,&quot; the bitterly  honest &quot;much afraid,&quot; and the beautiful &quot;hymn.&quot; This  disc is great for leading yourself into worship or for playing when you're  entertaining guests. I recommend this disc. It is albums like these that remind me that I really need to listen to all albums before buying them, regardless how much I like the artists' previous works.  What happened? Gone is all the fantastic percussion and wonderful rough-around--the-edges sound; in a word, over-produced. Also, after sitting down and studying the lyrics, they still don't make sense if you really think about them. Or at least they sure do not speak to the common experience of the Everyman Christian. Go back, please, go back... This CD is awesome!  All of the songs are so beautiful and inspiring.  One of the things I love about Jars of Clay is that I don't have one favorite song on the CD, I love the whole entire thing!  It's incredible.  The music  and lyrics and vocals are just awesome.  I would recommend this CD to  anyone who likes Christian music. I don't like bands that are predictable.  I was impressed by the first album, but expected more of the same.  Luckily for me, Jars have taken a new direction with their music.  While both albums have the characteristic Jars sound, they managed to make each sound original and creative.  And of course, the best thing about both is how the lyrics hold deep meaning for Christians, and make you look for it.  Much Afraid gets as much &quot;air time&quot; in my house as its predecessor.  I recommend Much Afraid to anyone who enjoys listening to creative genius in action Those who compare Much Afraid to Jars of Clay's self-titled debut are only insulting them and their efforts. Why? Because they've tried to make it obvious through this project and its stylistic timing that being compared to themselves is the LAST thing they want! Though even lead singer Dan Haseltine's voice is noticeably different, and packed with more nasal vowels than one would feel comfortable listening to at first, his new vocal style fits seamlessly into the one true love song on the project, ""Tea And Sympathy"", which contains brilliant metaphoric lyrics, and a haunting melody. The opening ""Overjoyed"" is almost nonsense. All I could pick up from that song is that Haseltine is dissatisfied with the name he's created for himself and realizes God's plan is far different. Other than that, the song is annoyingly vague to its real point, and it makes no sense. ""Fade To Grey"", however, is much more clear. It declares a ""state of blind confusion"" that no earthly god can remedy, because earthly gods are incapable of providing the affection that every human needs ""to turn me inside out"". The song is an anthem for God's frustrating mystery that knocks us on our butts and then brings us up every single time. ""Crazy Times"" ridicules the lazy Christians who swore they'd never hit rock bottom, yet have, and think that crying enough about it will get them out of it (""It takes more than your saline eyes to make things right""). ""Frail"" is a haunting, eerie, silent and sorrowful appology to God for being a cocky God-follower then being reminded at how infinite God is, and being unprepared to take it all in (""I've always been a fool/I fear this love reaction/Just like you said I would""). It's by far, my favorite on the whole project, musically and lyrically. It leaves you going ""Wow"" as the last eerie chord fades away. ""Five Candles"" ruins the heart of the attempt and should have stayed confined to the soundtrack of ""Liar Liar"" where it originally appeared for reasons obviously stated in the song's title. ""Weighed Down"" asks the ever-confusing Creator how a Christian can bear a heavy cross, and still have hope in the promise of a glorious and holy Kingdom. ""Portrait of an Apology"" is basically an offer of explainations of misunderstanding to a mistake the singer made against a person who could quite easily be either God or a human friend (the song doesn't specify which is the subject). ""Truce"" is the only other outwardly secular song on the whole project (added to ""Five Candles"" and ""Tea and Sympathy""). ""Much Afraid"" and the closing ""Hymn"" are both admissions to nothingness without holiness. The prior autobiographically tells in the present tense the story of a man who takes more time than most to realize that Christ is man's only best friend. ""Hymn"" rides on a similar beginning then ends by saying in a nutshell something like 'Life's ... to me, but God's with me so who cares? Praise God!'Their debut was more upbeat and optimistic, though sometimes very solemn, whereas Much Afraid is far darker and serious and full of questions that have no answers. But Jars of Clay is trying to turn heads, guys. Don't call this project an accident, a mistake, or a missed calling. The Jars know their stuff, they're the proffessionals, and it shows on this attempt. Leave them alone, let them do their thing. They've shown we can trust them...in any genre. Excellent work... if you liked &quot;Flood,&quot; you'll love this CD. Great, penetrating sounds, deep lyrics and easy on the ears... can be listened to all the way through over and over again. Definitely on my list  of the top 100 CDs I'd have to have w/ me if I was stranded on a deserted  island (with a solar-powered CD player, of course). ;-p Two Thumbs Up for Much Afraid! A very powerful album which will soon become the one you instinctively pull down to listen to time and time again. This is still my favourite gospel (rock) album ever. Although I also like Adrian Snell's The passion. What sets this apart from other releases are the catchy melodies, the heartfelt lyrics and pure emotion. I'm a music fan and this is just a good catchy record. Don't let the 'gospel' genre scare you there's a lot of good music in this genre, rock and rap. it's one of the best cds i have ever bought I am a huge Jars of clay Fan, I have all their albums, and I have to say that Much Afriad is their best. Tracks like &quot;Truce&quot; where Charlie's piano is so sweet with the background sounds, and &quot;Overjoyed&quot; semi-acoustic and harmony on chorus combine to uplift Dan's vocals to sublime. On &quot;Weighed Down,&quot; my favorite Jars of Clay song of all time, Stephen and Matt's guitars with high-to-low strumming and shakers have what it takes to back up the metaphorical lyrics and beautiful vocals. Great Musicianship, great Lyrics, tight vocals and fantastic variety. For some reason, the idea has become popular that Christian music is, by definition, of lower quality than &quot;Popular&quot; music.  That may have been true at one time, but not any more.  In the last decade there has been an explosion of Christian artists and subcategories, even introducing a bit of Christian Goth and Metal.  Though still not all of these are wonderful, there are many, many more that are.  At the forefront of the pack is Jars of Clay.Their self-titled debut album was a promising blend of folk and alternative, slightly reminiscent of a simpler Dave Matthews Band.  With this sophomore effort, the group goes for the gusto in a way that may surprise fans of the original album, adding a prominant electric guitar, as well as a full-out symphony in a few songs.  So much new depth is added, in fact, that the new style may be unrecognizable to some.Gone as well are the blatantly Gospel-inspired lyrics, replaced with beautifully atmospheric metaphors, helping to increase the cross-over succes of the album.  This is not to say they have forgotten their roots; they have just gotten more crafty about how they reveal them.This is truly a masterpiece album, atmospheric and poignant, plumbing the depths of despair while at the same time gleaming the one true ray of hope.  Jars of Clay could easily stand comparison to such musical genius as The Beatles or Radiohead  Espescially in this day and age where there is so much of the same thing, Jars stand head and shoulders over the crowd. Most of these reviews are written by Christians.  First of all, I hate the song Flood.  I hear a song on the muzak at work and it really catches me.  One day, I'm flipping channels and I come across the song and video.  Until the end, I didn't realize it was Jars of Clay.  About this time, I signed up for a CD club and put this album down (this was really pre-pirate downloads) so that I could get this song.  I had also heard that this was more of a non-Christian album.  So I gave it a try.  No, I didn't convert.  I found this album had a lot of catchy songs, that were well written and musically complex (Portrait of an Apology has duple rhythms against triples in compound time).  If you are a Christian you will find Christian meaning in this album.  If you are not a Christian, you will find music where the writer has a lot of questions, a lot of doubts and vulnerabilities. The lyrics tend to be vague enough to allow the listener their own interpretation of the lyrics (except for the last track Hymn). One of my favorite albums of theirs next to their first album, love the songs Weighed Down and Crazy Times. This is one of my lesser-liked JOC albums, but it is still a work of art IMO. I love tracks Five Candels, Crazy times, and fade to Gray. The best album they every produced is a toss-up between Their self-titled origianal album, and ""who we are instead"" I rank this one #4, behind the afore mentioned and then ""if i left the zoo"". They have a bit of a mellower, softer and quieter trend throughout this album, unlike most of thir work. , but still maintaining the originality and uniquness that makes them the great band they are. Excellent songwriting once again, beautifully woven words with deep meaning. My favorite band hands down. NO problems at all. It was mailed on time and in the described condition. I would buy again from this seller. I have to admit that I didn't like Much Afraid from the first time I heard it, which wasn't the case for their debut, Jars of Clay,that I loved from the very first listen. As a matter of fact, when I first heard it, I skipped through all the songs, only listening and liking the powerful but still mellow and soft &quot;Crazy Times&quot; - something only JOC seems to be able to pull off- and was sort of dissapointed since they wandered away from their original very acoustic style. But a about a year and a half later I picked it up again and as I went through it I wondered how could I have possibly not liked it when I first heard it. I fell in love with this album. Although it's different than JOC (there's still acoustic guitars of course, but more electric guitars, and of course lots of strings) it's better because it's more diverse. The opening &quot;Overjoyed&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Fade to grey&quot; kick it off amazingly: fast but still mellow and extremely lovely melodies. Other songs like &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; and &quot;Much Afraid&quot; really reach you with their touching lyrics and again amazing melodies. But the songs that really stand out are &quot;Portrait of an Apology&quot;-an increadebly complexed song and &quot;Frail&quot;, with its haunting melody, and beautiful words (&quot;If I was not so weak, if I was not so cold, if I was not so scared of being broken growing old, I would be Frail&quot;) and strings. It's one of their best songs overall. They're a more mature band, which shows in the songwritting -lyrics and music- and hopefully will continue to make such incredible music for a long time. I am mortified by the previous negative reviews of 'much afraid.'  This album reflects the complexities of the God-loving heart better than most Christian bands could hope to reflect.  As for those who want nursery  rhyme-simple lyrics and straightforward devotion, how much do you really  think about your faith?  The beauty of the lyrics are their  multi-dimensional meanings.  As I recall, a certain book written a long  time ago has been interpreted and re-interpreted over the centuries and is  still the basis for a very strong religion.

223,445,B000000572,"great album short but on point.Celly cels first three albums are legendary.Killa kali is a little better only because there are more songs.Hot sunny day and bailin thru the hood are the best songs. Sick Wid It member Celly Cel drops a solid album back in '94, around the time the Bay Area was starting to become popular (especially everyone who was signed to Jive Records). Celly's debut is no different than any other rapper from that area. A lot of gun and murder talk over P-funk samples, which was very popular around that time. Tracks such as the title track, ""Retaliation"", and ""What Am I Supposed To Do"", are prime examples of the subject matter.But what separates him from other rappers is that he has the ability to expand his lyrics outside of that box. Tracks like like ""Gin With No Juice"" (For the record: that is not a response to Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's song), ""Hot Sunny Day"" are great as the have a nice west coast vibe to them. There are a few songs about hoes such as ""How To Catch A *****"", and ""Nothin' But ****"". Both songs are held solidly well. Outside of that, the lyrics start to become repetitive along the album.The production is good too, done by Studio Ton and Mike Mosley & Sam Bostic. Most of it carries the album and works well with Celly's vocals.  As I mentioned before, expect a lot of P-Funk sounding beats on here.Expect Celly Cel's debut to sound dope. If you enjoy Bay Area gangsta rap, then this is the album for you. The lyrics are somewhat limited, but at the same time, Celly puts them to good use. If you are looking for other better sounding releases from The Bay Area who are signed to Jive, I recommend Too $hort, E-40, and Casual. Peace.Lyrics: B-Production B+Guest Appearances: C+Musical Vibes: B-Top 5 Tracks:1. Hot Sunny Day (featuring Levitti, Marijuana Mitchell, and Kim Larson)2. Heat For Yo Azz (featuring Suga T)3. Nuthin' But ****4. Gin With No Juice5. Funk 4 Life (featuring Levitti) This cd is one of the best from Celly Cel. It's got old school beats and real gangsta raps. Also a few appearances by the rest of The Click (E-40 and B-Legit). Celly Cel brings some straight g-funk on this CD back in '94. The production by Mike Mosley & Sam Bostic is dope especially on &quot;Bailin' Thru The Hood&quot; with B-Legit is an instant classic with Mosley doing the boards. This CD did not get a lot of pub where I'am from here in crappy St. Louis, MO. Some other dope tracks are &quot;What's A Nigga To Do&quot;, &quot;Hot Sunny Day&quot;, & there is a bonus track on the CD that I have call &quot;Zig Zags & Body Bags&quot;. This CD along with &quot;Killa Kali&quot; is about a tie but I would give &quot;Killa Kali&quot; the edge with better production. So if you are an old school gangsta rap lover, pick this up. Ya this cd hits hard and for that matter any one of celly cels cds hit hard. the nmb gives luv fo this cd and all ya should buy this piece. Dis album is phat. Celly Cel's first stuff is well worth gettin'. Check dis Celly Cel album out. Contact me at yuckplace@hotmail.com if ya got questions or anythang. Celly Cel's debut album, Heat 4 Yo Azz is yet another reason why 1994 is one of my favorite years in rap history.  Mike Mosely, Sam Bostic, and Studio Ton set Celly up with some sick G-Funk beats that u can only find around this time, many are influenced by the P-Funk music of the 70's like ""Funk 4 Life"" and ""What Am I Supposed To Do."" Celly Cel has a sick flow and gives you pure gangsta rhymes throughout.  The title track is sick, with the beat sampling the beginning of the One Way classic ""Cutie Pie,"" but instead of becoming fun and relaxing like the original, Mosely and Bostic take it in a sav direction, one of the hardest Sick Wid' It beats with Celly Cel givin you front row seats to gun smoke and robberies.  ""Hot Sunny Day"" is a more laid-back, summer bar-b-q, ridin thru the hood, fun time track with Levitti and Marjuna Mitchell, and ""Bailin' Thru My Hood"" with B-Legit is a sick rider anthem.  Gangsta rap may not have been anything new in 1994, but Celly Cel has an intriguing and entertaining way of givin you the 411 on life in the hood.","Pop Rap,Pop,R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Gangsta & Hardcore,West Coast,Funk",great short point celly cels first three legendary killa kali little better hot sunny day bailin thru hood best sick wid member celly cel drops solid back around time bay area starting become popular especially everyone signed jive records cellys debut different rapper area lot gun murder talk p funk samples popular around time title retaliation supposed prime examples subject matter separates rappers ability expand lyrics outside box like like gin juice record response dr dre snoop doggs hot sunny day great nice west coast vibe hoes catch nothin great short point celly cels cels legendary killa killa kali better hot sunny day hood best sick member celly cel cel drops solid time bay bay area area starting popular especially signed jive records records cellys debut different rapper area lot gun murder talk p funk funk samples popular time title retaliation supposed prime examples subject subject matter matter separates rappers ability expand lyrics box gin juice record response dr dre dre snoop snoop doggs hot sunny day great nice coast vibe hoes catch nothin

E-40 and B-Legit collaborated with some of the heavyhitters of the industry with the height of Sick Wid It Records success by the release of Southwest Riders.  The new recruits, A-1, started the entire compilation off with the strong Mob style track ""Represent"" and newcomer to the majors Komacauszy on ""Evil Ways"" featuring The Lost Mob.  W.C. gave his best on the C-walking, gangster ""Walk With Me"".  The other half of the group Illegal, Mr. Malik (Hershey Loc) flowed well over ""Big Bank"".  ""...No need for the ambulance..."" when 3X Krazy's fast orthodox flow on ""Call The Coroner"".  Suga T. & Conscious Daughters are the only females to represent well on ""Bad Bitches"".  Tela made it clear with his player type lyrics on ""Dis Year"".  The standout for disc #2 is ""Hiside"" by UGK with a slow riding grooves with a funky guitar lick.  Memphis' groups Three 6 Mafia and Eightball & MJG put a good foot forward.  There's thirty tracks on here and there's a lot on here to check out.  Almost a classic compilation failed where some artists didn't give that one needed good song for this album.  This release is Sick Wid It. THIS IS THE DEFINETLY 1 OF THE BETTER COMPILATIONZ IVE HEARD-THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE-FROM THE SOUTH 2 THA WEST E-40 & B-LEGIT COLLABORATED ON SUM FUNK-SLAM THE EVIL WAYS TRACK If I could I would rate this album 4.5 starts, since 5 means a perfect album. Unlike many double CD albums, SouthWest Riders is an album packed  with many many tight songs while the minority is weak songs. Out of 28  songs maybe 5or 6 aren't that worth listening to. The rest is just bangin'!  This album is a compliation combining rappers from the West and The South.  Awsome rappers like D-Shot, W.C., UGK, Eightball, MJG, 3X Krazy, Celly Cel,  Tela, A-1, Mossie, E-40, B-Legit, Richie Rich and many mnay more drop some  real bombs. This album is all hardcore, no RnB flava on it and it gives as  some real gangsta rap to ride to. I'd like to thank Sick Wid it Record for  this album. As expected and foretold the disc has some instant classics. and the quality of the cd's were as if they came fresh out a newly opened case.

225,447,B00000057M,"This CD is far sicker than their other ones (that I've heard anyway), but it is also a lot better!  The song Toy Box is truly hilarious, and The Joker's Wild is probably the funniest thing that I have ever heard.  Some  of the songs towards the end are actually good quality, especially Ol Evil  Eye.  That is about the only one of their songs that actually has decent  background music, it's quite amazing.  The problem with this CD is that  almost half the songs deal with NECROPHILIA, not a happy topic for me!  So,  I would recommend this if you have a sick sense of humor. all the songs are cool.i will go over my faves.chichen huntin is all about rednecks that are being hunted by the clowns.he hits him in the nugget with a 12 gauge bucket of chicken nuggets.its a lot like a very scary halloween story.toy box is about a social disaster who goes to school with a bag full of killing toys to get revenge on his tormenters.oooooh look he pulled out a rubber ducky.it makes a funny sound then BAM!blows his fingers off his !!@#$% hands.cemetery girl is a very nasty story about a guy whos having a hard time accepting his girlfriends death.in headless boogie the dead all get up and do a new dance called the headless boogie.its danceable!and no icp album would be complete without a love song.this one is all about a wicked clown who breaks in a lot of chicks when he gets into town. Alright so lets get on with the riddle box shall we?this is not icps best work but it is epic.my fav tracks r probably I'm coming home and op red eye. A lil something something is good but should be on the EP tunnel of love. Chicken hunting (slaughter house remix) is my third fav.its better than the ringmaster version.it has a metal touch to it.Ny way get riddle box it so awesome!(p.s this edition is better than classic.the cover looks cooler.) Whats up fellow Juggalos?  After listining to the &quot;Great Malinko&quot; I had to get the one I.C.P. album I didn't have.  I bought &quot;The Riddlebox&quot; and put it in.  I laughed my butt off on the intro.  One of my favorite tracks is &quot;Toy Box&quot;.  I also like &quot;Deadbody Man&quot;.  If you are an I.C.P. fan or just curious get &quot;The Riddlebox&quot;. The riddlebox is one of my favorite joker cards because they didn't really care what people thought about there music and had alot of fun making it here's what i think about each song on this c.d.1.Intro-ok it gets you ready for the riddlebox and puts a picture in your head about what the riddlebox does.3/52.Riddle Box-I love this intro, i bump this, it's just so original.5/53.The show must go on - pretty good not my favorite but pretty kool sort of like the hokus pokus on milenko.4/54.Chicken Huntin'[Slaughter House Mix]-Great, better than the Ringmaster version.5/54.5.Hidden Interview-Don't really ike it it, i skip it.2/55.Toy Box- I like this one it's funny, especially the skit afterwords.5/56.Cemetary Girl-pretty interesting song but not all that great i'll give it a 4/57.3 Rings- i skip this one too but it's alright8.Headless Boogie- I Hate this song, but i'll give it a 2/5 since they tried i think.9.Jokers Wild- pretty good song gameshow style 3/510.Dead Body Man - I Love this song it's a classic i got to give it a 5/511.Lil Somethin' Somethin'- lol i love this song omg i love the chorus it's just so gay sounding but i dont know i love it 5/512.Ol' Evil Eye- it's an ok song, it's based on the story by Edgar Allan Poe.3/513.12- i like this song it's about killing like what 12 people it's pretty wicked.4/514.The Killing Fields. ok song not my favorite.2/515.I'm Comin' Home- as all the last songs are on i.c.p cd's this one is awsome.5/5 i love this cd alot too. its a classic. cant wait to come back and buy the rest of them. What up, Juggalos?  I must say, Riddle Box is and always will be a classic in ICP flava.  Includes such wicked tracks like &quot;Chicken Huntin',&quot; &quot;Toy Box,&quot; &quot;3 Rings,&quot; and more.  This is a must-have in any Juggalo collection.  Get yours today!!!

MUSIC IS MY FAVORITE AND ALWAYS WILL BE.ICP'S MUSIC I WILL ALWAYS LIKE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE BASICKLY IT IS GOOD AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY. Shaggy 2 Dope, and Violent J won't dissapoint you with this one. I like all of ICP's Cd's but this is the first one I listened to and it's still the best. It's absolutely hilarious....... and even if ICP is sick, they  are funny as anything. All juggalos know once you've heard these tracks you  will be down with the clown intro-?/10 its an intro not much to sayriddle box-8/10 its cool but it sounds like another introthe show must go on-10/10 like one reviewer said its like the murder go round of the riddle boxchicken huntin-10/10- one of my favorite songs also the song the plays to wake me up :)interview-10/10-funny but weirdtoy box-9/10 great song about revenge and its consequencescemetery girl-10/10 very creepy chorusthree rings-10/10 funny song i love the little monologue at the end(i think its violent j w/ his voice sped up)headless boogie-9/10 good song but it can get a little repetitive at the endthe jokers wild-10/10 i always love the game show songsdead body man-10/10 my favorite song on the album its so darklil somethin somethin-5/10 not my favorite songol evil eye-10/10 great song besides i love edgar allen poe12-10/10 one of the best songs they ever made and it makes a valid point about the death penaltythe killing fields-10/10 a kind of purgatory reminds me of danteim coming home-9/10 great way to end the cdoverall i would say that this was a great album. and if you were just starting to listen to icp i would start with either this one or the great milenko. Easily the Juggalo favorite! And as it should be. The Riddle Box mixes horror clown edge with a** shaking beats, making a person dance while snickering in disgust. It's bouncy rhythms and nursery rhyme lyrics call to mind it's Cyprus Hill influence but this is not a bad thing. In fact it seems a perfect fit for ICP. Enough, that it takes their sound to a (over used expression ahead) new level. The downbeat tone that started on the ""Ringmaster"" is still here but it doesn't hesitate to give way to a more fun and smiling level of sadism. With the cringe inducing but goofy indulgences taken in the lyrics, producer Mike Clark perfectly parallels it with side splitting cartoonish embellishments. So ICP's descriptive lyrics, vividly revel in its own jolly carnage. Songs like ""Toy Box"", ""Ol' Evil Eye"", and ""3 Rings"" are fully immersed into ICP's dark carnival spirit of macabre storytelling. While ""Cemetery Girl,"" ""Jokers Wild"" and ""Headless Boogie"" testify for their hammy necro-disgusto cred. ICP never seemed happier, bragging about the clown life and the listener is along for the gleefully perverse ride. Even two semi hits rear their heads with the demanding sing along style of ""Chicken Huntin"" and the bong hitting beats of ""Dead Body Man"". Too bad for J and Shaggy that Jive records chose not to give ""Riddle Box"" a national push when they had the chance because it is ICP's most accessible and shocking release. Notorious but  successfully sound ingredients for a hit. If you were around for, and bought into the ""Milenko"" hype, this release deserves your attention. Unlike ICP's more recent releases, you'll be happy you did! Much to the urging of one of my friends, I actually did listen to this whole alblum, and it was one of the single most painful expirences of my entire life. Very bad indeed, I really do not know why anyone like this alblum. I didn't really see any humor, except fpr the fact that it was so horrible, and if these guys do have any musical talent, I sure couldn't tell from this. I wouldn't even give one star, that's still giving it too much credit. This CD is Da Bomb.  Everyone who like ICP loves this CD. It was what got alot of Juggalos into ICP.  This is there best CD. I think the best of ICP's music is on the Riddle Box. One of Insane Clown Posse's best. This CD is a must have for any fans of the wicked s***. MCL to all the juggalos. one of my favorite albums.  between the great milenko and riddle box, those are the best jokers cards!  i have listened to this cd for like a year, and i haven't goten tired of it!  also, the best song on the album  is chicken huntin (slaughterhouse remix).  these psychopaths (no pun  intended) really know how to entertain! LOVED IT!!!! My Favorite jokers card. This album just has the best beats and rhymes it makes you wanna go crazy! Loved this album it was just AWESOME I heard from a reliable source that there is an ICP cd out that was supposed to be a 2 cd set but it was sent out as 2 different cds. They said that one of them has Exclamation marks and the swirl and the other on has Question marks and the swirl. WHat i want to know is how can i get both of them ??? Ive got every thing with Insane clown posse, twiztid, anybody killa, blaze, esham, and this cd beats em all. The Riddlebox is a classic. i miss this time of icp so much...commical wicked horror music...why oh why, and where has it all gone!!?? this is the first icp i ever heard and i used to own the version with extra tracks on it.. how do i find that again. really wish i could get that. if anyone knows about this let me know!!! Many self-respecting Juggalo's claim that this (and of course The Great Milenko) is the prime Insane Clown Posse album. It is. Fun is an understatement to say the least. &quot;I'm Coming Home&quot; is probably my  favorite ICP song of all time, although favoritism is a form of segregation  in my opinion. This is the one album that even ICP-haters can tolerate.  Top Three Songs:I'm Coming Home Chicken Huntin' (Slaughterhouse Mix)  Damn, every song is great, nevermind. This is ICP's best album ever.  It has lots of their best songs.  It is one of their most violent CD's.  It has a perfect mix of violence and humor.  The best tracks on the CD include;Cemitary GirlComin Home12Ol Evil EyeChickin huntinSo if u down with the Clown u gota have this CD.U aint a Juggalo until u get this CD.... so get it! its amazing cd, in good shape ,i just love it so much , its the best whoop whoop  juggalo family I used to like ICP...in 3rd grade. If you are a smart person then you will know exactly what im talking about when you look at the title of my review. Now, i must give ICP props for starting up a whole new sub-genre, ""Horror Rap"", BUT, it's just hard for me to respect 2 wannabe-gangsta clowns. And im being literal when i say ""clowns"". I think the only male band that could pull off wearing make-up and not looking like complete homosexuals are KISS. This CD is just stupid. And that's why I listened to it when i was in 3rd grade. ""Chickin Huntin"" was the coolest song back then...the only reason i am giving this CD 2 stars is because i still think Chickin Huntin is kind of funny. Just kind of. Last year, I had never even heard the name &quot;Insane Clown Posse&quot;. And then a freind let me listen to the &quot;Great Melinko's Neden Game&quot;. So then I went to the record store to find &quot;TGM&quot; and  stumbled over The Riddle Box. From that day on I have been under a trance  by there pleasingly wicked sound and sick humor. So as I wait for there  next Cd to come out I can easily say that they are at their best in the  Riddle Box. WHO EVER SAID THEY SUCK WHICH ICP DOESNT SUCK YOU SUCK YOUR A RETARD ICP IS DA BOMB IF U DONT LIKE EM GET OUT INSANE CLOWN POSSE WICKED CLOWNZZ YO GET THIS CD IF YA A JUGGALO If you repeat these words you must suck worst then this.Come on heads diss this crap make it get 1 star they suck. U already know, juggalo love, this baby was mint when I got it and super well packaged. Definitely a collectors item for me. BUY IT This is one of ICP's best albums.  It's funny, fresh, and filled to the brim with Faygo and Dark Carnival madness.  If you consider yourself a juggalo and don't have this CD in your collection, you're only kidding yourself.  Songs like &quot;Toy Box&quot; and &quot;The Joker's Wild&quot; really display ICP's ability turn an everyday situation into a horrific, hilarious slaughter.  MCL, juggalos!! Not their best CD (The Great Milenko takes that) but not disappointing at all.  Their second best.  All Juggalos should have this one We need more of a vinyl selection from the Insane Clown Posse. The records are fun to spin and bring a unique detail to their special sound. After putting together two entertaining and intriguing albums (&quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot; &amp; &quot;Ringmaster&quot;), ICP found their formula and hit their creative peak with this masterpiece.  &quot;Riddlebox&quot; is the ultimate ICP album. On the 3rd Joker's Card J  and Shaggy deliver a hip hop album with so much punch it could crack  somebody's ribs if they were turned sideways while this CD was playing.  Outrageously funny at times, and psychotic all the way through, the album  hits hardest after the track 'Lil' Sumpin' Sumpin'' ends.  The final four  songs (especially the haunting song &quot;12&quot;, which is arguably ICP's  best song ever) create the dark mood that best describes the world of the  Juggalos and the Dark Carnival, and sets the stage for the 4th Joker's  Card, &quot;The Great Milenko&quot;.  And as for some people saying ICP  can't put out good music like Korn or Limp Bizkit?  Just check out the  remix of &quot;Chicken Huntin'&quot; which came out the same time Korn's  first album did, and WAY before L.B.  Finally, I will say that if you don't  own &quot;Riddlebox&quot;, or have never heard it, you will never truly  understand yourself. my time listening to ICP has been short but i love them just like any other juggalo. youll laugh so hard at the lyrics that youll piss your pants. this is by far ICP best album and i suggest every juggalo should by  it. SHAGGY IS THE BOMB!!! this was an excellent album. i am going to rate each track by saying if it is fresh, ok, or stale.intro- n/ariddle box- okthe show must go on- freshchicken huntin- freshinterview- staletoy box- okcemetery girl- fresh3 rings- freshheadless boogie- freshthe joker's wild- okdead body man- freshlil somthin somthin- freshol evil eye- fresh12- okthe killing fields- freshi'm coming home- ok tihs is a great album with a funny mix of violence and humor. for example,take my fav track:&quot;Toy Box&quot;:toy box is funny because of the mix of horendous violence and hilarious cleverness.If you have a somewhat fun and open-minded personality,unlike alot of these stupid reveiwers,you should go buy this album. This cd is absolutely great, with the exception of the odd track i like the entire album. For the reviewers that weren't happy with this buy because they feel it didn't live up to the claims of being oldschool i get what you mean because its not what you expected, this album would nopt fit in the catogory of old school for me, it would fit in to the catogory of old school ICP though. This album was a part of a transition for ICP, theyre first album in particular had an oldschool feel to every single track, most of the beats sound like roger troutman and just west coast sound in general inspired, but the lyrics are far from it, there were no expectations for ICP on there first album, they werent expected to do anything and they didnt really only selling 34 copies in its first month but the ""carnival of carnage"" created an underground following for ICP, the ""Ringmaster"" was there next LP to be released it kept some of the carnival of carnages feel and definately kept the same crazy lyrics, by now the duo had grown in popularity. The ""Riddlebox"" LP although it still was crazy, the sound was very much different, the one track in particular that signified change was the ""chickien huntin'"" slaughter house mix, ICP were at a crossroad on this album which i think is one of the reason why it is so good, it has a great combination of the old school feel found on the carnival of carnage and rock rap found on their follow up album ""the great milenko"". I reccomend this to any horrorcore or physcopathic fan.The stand out tracks for me are-Chicken Huntin (slaughter house mix)-the joker's wild-dead body man-im coming homealthough it is hard to pick favourite tracks of this album but the clear standout for me is chicken huntin. I'm not a huge rap guy but I can handle ICP.  This CD is cool but not the best.I don't listen to it much anymore though. The 3rd Jokers Card is ICP before the guitars came along and got rid of the rap beats, this is ICP at their creative peak, also this is the first ICP album that was released on a major record label Jive Records, which i think 2pac was on in 95 i think.Intro: A funny and evil intro, try and listen for the Southwest Strangla song in the background. 5/5RiddleBox: Ok, its gets you more ready for the album.3/5Show Must Go On: Good song but not great. 3/5Chicken Huntin (SlaughterHouse Remix): What can i say other than its a classic, better than the stale original on The Ringmaster album. 5/5Interview: Funny 1st time around, but then a skipper after that 1/5Toy Box: Great song bout J being an evil toy maker, good lyrics but the beat makes the song. 5/5Cematary Girl: Necrophillia, how nice. great song, if you can get past the horrible issue involved. 5/53 Rings: Was originally on Shaggys solo album F*ck Off, but Violent J appeared on it, so they put it on here, its about life of a freak in the circus. 5/5Headless Boogie: Good idea, J stumbles upon a dead nightclub, meaning its the dead dancing and dj is also dead, good song. 4/5Jokers Wild: Done in gameshow style, its very funny and violent. 5/5Dead Body Man: A cult favourite, it appeared on the Terror Wheel EP, its a classic. 5/5Lil' Somthin' Somthin': The sex song and its horrible, i cant stand it. 1/5Ol' Evil Eye: Great song and good beat, Shaggy raps excellent on here, also the talking in the back is from The Tell Tale Heart by Edgar Allen Poe. 5/512: Another classic, needs to be heard. 5/5Killing Fields: Another Evil song but good as well. 5/5I'm Coming Home: Great outro song, another classic. 5/5U need This if u like old school ICP ICP is the best group ever and this is probably the best Joker's Card I can't decided if I like this or Ringmaster, or Milenko the most heh. Anyway definetely buy this it's just amazing. Insane Clown Posse are one of the best, most creative bands around! This 1995 album is mind-blowing, and probably their best. You should definately pick it up, even if you don't think you'll like it. This was the album that turned me into a huge ICP fan, and will probably do the same to you. This is 1 of their freshest albums as well. ICP esp their 1st 6 or 7 albums are EPIC!! MCL This cd is pure wickedness. Any juggalo cannot be without this album. It has to be one of the best albums to hit stores EVER. First off, screw you if you're judging me, I f&*cking love ICP!!!! No matter what mood I get in, I can jam to these clowns like it's no one's business! I prefer the ICP before the Wraith was released, after that ""in my opinion"" they lost their touch! For those not familiar with the story of ICP, they preach of what is called The Dark Carnival!  The Dark Carnival, was divided in to 6 jokers cards!  This one here (The Riddle Box), is the 3rd one, my favorite one!  The managed to stick other albums between the Jokers cards such as The Terror Whhel, Tunnel of Love, 2 Bizaar EP's, and a few more!  You will be asking yourself, what exactly is the dark carnival?  And you will find out on the 6th Jokers Card, The Wraith:Shangri La ( the heavenly side of the carnival ), then there's The Wraith: Hells Pit ( the opposite ).  ICP fans are known as juggalos, most ""juggalos"" turn there love of ICP and other psychpathic artists into a lifestyle.  I couldn't do that considering the fact I only dig ICP and there buddies Twiztid.  TO be honest I couldn't hang with most juggalo's because they'd pull this carp such as "" If you ain't got this piece of merchandise then you ain't a juggalo "".  They don't know squat!  I'm getting aheAd of myself, the reason I dig this album the most, is for the certain stand out tracks!  Toy Box is my fave, The show must go on, 12, Ol' Evil Eye, The Jokers Wild, Cemetary Girl, and of course Chicken Huntin' are some other stand outs! Preaching of Dead Girls, Faygo beverages, hatred towards redneck biggots and yuppies, Murder and other fascinations towards horror...it's seriously entertaining! Other Joker cards are:CARNVAL OF CARNAGETHE RINGMASTERTHE RIDDLE BOX ***THE GREAT MILENKOTHE AMAZING JEKKELL BROTHERSTHE WRAITH:SHANGRI LATHE WRAITH:HELL'S PITI honestly think the juggalo lifestyle is fun! Unless you become an egotistical prick about it, bragging that you're the biggest juggalo than the other average person! I didn't wanna become that so I stuck with being myslelf, jamming to this wicked S&*T, and Heavy METAL! Get into it, have fun, and most of all be loving to The Family and Be yourself. MMFCL >=O) It's a little known fact, but clowns really hate mimes. Most normal people don't know this, but Insane Clown Posse fans, or 'Juggaloes' (as they like to be called) keep this little-known code close to their heart. And when their favorite band doesn't shut up about it, how can you not remember it?What I'm trying to say is, this album is filled with too many tracks that just rant on and on about how ICP hates mimes. It's okay for the first couple of songs, but when each one of your 20 songs talks about nothing but hating mimes, then it gets a little tiring.Best songs: ""I hate mimes"", ""Attack of the mimes"", ""The war (on mimes)"", ""All Juggaloes should attack any mimes they see"", and ""Am I a nazi for hating mimes?""Worst songs: ""All mimes should go back to mimevillie"", ""If there was a movie on being a mime, then everyone would hate it"", ""Clowns vs. Mimes: The ultimate battle"", and ""Beat Down Those Mimes"" this was the first album of ICP's that i had listened to, and i've been listening ever since. the storytelling makes almost every song worth while to listen to, and if you're into horror tales, this band is where you go to.I've listened to Riddlebox countless times, and finally after years i had gotten sick of it. There are very few CD's out there that i can do that to. not everything on here is great, but the vast majority of songs are repeat material worth checking out. i can do without the interview on track 5, and Lil' Somethin Somethin, but overall, the rest are really pretty decent. 12, dead body man, and I'm coming home are my favorites and i still haven't gotten tired of those songs even now. if you're into the clowns and haven't listened to this CD yet, then what's wrong with you? listen to it. if you have (should be everyone looking here) you know this is one of their best. It is so stupid, i mean come on they are all old and saggy and Yo wannabe's when will they get it, the reason that they are not famous is beause they arent good enough to make it in the real music world. Its just so sad. And what is all this crap with milenko and juggalo they dont even know what a juggalo is and violent j or whatever his name is i dont know what it is but how dumb is that. I think they might be intersecting instead of parrallel because to be a rapper you gotta talk bout girls which they are obviously bad at instead of talking about dead chickens and pig, and that is why i give it a one star raing. I really like this album...ICP may be deranged but who cares? They tell good stories and they are funny. I like a lot of their other stuff but this is THE cd to get if you want to hear ICP at their best. after the edgy work of the ringmaster ICP come back with this: THE RIDDLEBOX, its surely a fantastic listen and while it doesnt hit a hard a impact as great milenko would later on, its still their second or maybe third best album after the amazing jeckel brothers....the most enjoyable songs are, &quot;Lil somthin somthin&quot;, &quot;ol' evil eye&quot;, &quot;12&quot;(the best), &quot;The killing feilds&quot;, &quot;Im coming Home&quot; and &quot;chicken Huntin(slaughter house mix&quot;, the songs that simply arent as good as the others are &quot;dead body man&quot; and &quot;The jokers wild&quot;(which is funny but isnt that good of a song as a whole), this album has some dark moments, easily found at the end of the album, and has its funny moments,(see the end of toy box for one of them), this album also has in my opinion the best cover art and colors(purple and green), ICP creates a dark mood with a twist of humour in this album, and Riddle Box is certainly one of their finest efforts to date, go buy this album if ur looking for some dark fun. This is a really good CD. It has plenty of funny and scary lyrics to entertain you. but the only problem is theres too much about dead bodies. Rapping about a corpse is sick enough but when the whole cd is nothing but that, it boring. and im sure nobody wants to hear about having sex with your deceased girlfriend...nobody (exept a juggalo) Great product love it great price to add to my collection came quick no complaints here thank u for the buy Time flows like a dark horde, consuming all in its path. Man lives his life in the blink of an eye. Just as day becomes night, all life fades into death. In death each person will be judged for his deeds performed while alive. There are the few who walk a life of purpose, and there are those who trod the path of greed, their souls host to demons. Time slows near each person's end. Those whose deeds were evil grasp onto life as long as they can because, though they don't know what awaits them in the afterlife, they feel for them it is a horror beyond words. Time stops in this world, as the heart becomes still and the soul leaves the body. In the afterlife time is eternal, and even death is but a new beginning. For you see, when you step into death your soul steps upon the floor of a dark chamber and you look to see it empty, except for a strange looking box on an old wooden table. On the front of the box, you will see a painted question mark faded with time and a twisted crank handle on its side. Turning the handle, a sharp melodic tune will fill the air. For the evil ones this sound will be a deafening noise reverberating off the walls and building into a climatic terror. But the surprise is when the music stops as you slowly turn the handle... and then the top of the box pops. For the few, they will see a vision of God with a golden light warming their souls as they step forth into eternal peace. For most they will see a fog seeping from the box, stripping their sanity, as they witness an image of hell, spawned and formed fromtheir own evil; a hideous reflection of their demented souls. The floor of the room begins falling away as they plummet into a bottomless pit full of shadowy creatures, forever to be lost in a sinister void. What will be in store for you is the mystery, but if you take a look within yourself you will find the answer. For now, you still have time to change the outcome of... the mighty Riddle Box.With the 3rd Joker's card Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope master the art of humour, horror, story telling and a thought out story based on ""The Riddle Box"" this is easily one of their best. Definetly in the top two, only behind The Ringmaster.As we all know, this was the first icp album released on a major label, Jive. Who ended up screwing them over by only releasing this in Detroit and so on. Every Joker's Card is different and special in their own way, with their own story. This is no different.Intro - 4/5 A short minute and a half intro about a man who dies in a car accident and faces The Riddle Box.Riddle Box - 4/5 A pretty short song at only 2:53, this seems like a way to just give you a preview of things to come.The Show Must go on - 4.5/5 I see this song as the murder-go-round(found on The Ringmaster) of The Riddle Box, story of a man who's town is visited by an evil carnival. Has a great chant at the end.Chicken Huntin' (Slaughter House Mix) - 5/5 When icp signed to jive, they asked icp to do a remix of Chicken Huntin' Jive brought in a team to remix it but icp hated it, so they just did it themselves. Just as good as the first version maybe even better.Interview - ?/? An odd interlude, funny the first time and worth a few listens.Toy Box - 4.5/5 Story of a 6 year old violent J whom has been outcasted by his peers and seeks revenge.Cemetary Girl - 5/5 GREAT song. A love soung between J and his dead girlfriend. Has a great chorus.3 Rings - 4.5/5 This was also on the Shaggy 2 Dope ep ""f*ck off"" the squeaky voice at the start of this song is really just J with his voice sped up.Headless Boogie - 5/5 icp makes a joke song about a new dance craze with the dead.The Joker's Wild - 5/5 a song about a game show. Violent J plays the host and Shaggy 2 Dope has the part of the announcer.Dead Body Man - 4.5/5 Classic horrorcore rap song. Also found on the Terror Wheel ep. Was a local hit in Detroit hit prior to their signing to Jive.Lil' Somethin' Somethin' - 2.5/5 Just a dumb song, doesn't sound much like icp and just can't get into it.Ol' Evil Eye - 5/5 After one bad song, the best part of the album starts, the final four songs) incredible story telling by J and Shaggs. Great horror rap.12 - 6/5 J plays the part of a man who was sentenced to death but comes back from the dead to kill the jury that put him to death. Easily one of the best here.The Killing Fields - 5/5 pretty much seems like a song about purgatory, The beat is chilling and so is the preacher's voice that comes in near the end.I'm Coming Home - 5/5 a pretty emotional song. J and Shaggs really put everything into this song. Perfect way to end this album.So, should you buy this album? If you like icp of course but if you hate them, this won't change your mind. I recommend this to anybody with an open mind. Enjoy. This is probably my second favourite Insane Clown Posse album, behind ""The Great Milenko"". This is one of their most psycho albums aswell, which I like heaps. My 2 favourite songs would have to be ""Chicken Huntin' (Slaughter House Remix)"" & ""Dead Body Man"". This album is definately a must-have for all juggalos. HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMCLJono My son, Christopher Colt Kelley, was murdered on December 21, 2001. He was 15 years old and he was a real Juggalo. He used to try and get me to play ICP cd's all the time whenever we were riding in the car together and I wouldn't listen to them. When he was murdered I took the time to sit and listen to what he was in to. I haven't stopped listening to ICP yet. I met Violent J once before Shangri-La came out and I told him all about my son. He held my hand and told me in these words that I will never forget, ""You should not be sad that he is gone, you should always look at it like this, whenever it rains, that's him Raining Diamonds down on you."" Then Shangri-La dropped and I heard It Rains Diamonds...and I could not stop crying. Now I am a 37 year old Juggalette and I'll be that way 'til I'm dead in the ground. My son was buried with an ICP shirt on and a Hatchetman round his neck. And I plan on going the same way. Everyone has their own thoughts about ICP and the Dark Carnival...but if you're not a true Juggalo....you'll never get it. MCL and R.I.P. Colt....we miss you. 1995 was a huge year for Detroit underground rap duo Insane Clown Posse. Mainly because they released their 3rd LP entitled ""Riddle Box"". This album is their first to be released in stores nationwide, due to Psychopathic Records' brief distribution deal with Jive Records' short-lived phony label ""Battery Records"".When I first heard this album, I was completely blown away. Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope move away from gangsta rap and focus more on horrorcore. Violent J goes deeper in the depths of his infamous ""sick storytelling rap"". This is also the first album he uses his ""squeaky"" voice which he was once known for. Shaggy 2 Dope doesn't disappoint at all. In fact, he is nearly on par with J, although he doesn't tell stories as much, Shaggy can still spit the wicked ""graveyard"" and sex raps.The production here stands out as well, once again, courtesy of the legendary Mike E. Clark. His production contribution here is what made me consider him one of the best underground rap producers out there. His beat style switches from funk (""Headless Boogie"") to just flat out scary beats (""12""). ICP also co-produced this, like many of their previous releases. The production gets 2 thumbs up from me.To give you a deeper analysis on the individual tracks. Here's my track-by-track ratings.01. ""Intro"" (N/A)02. ""Riddle Box"" (N/A)03.

But, I'll get to that one later. I strongly recommend this to Juggalos, people who like funky rap and horrorcore rap fans. This album was well worth every penny. Just go ahead and give it a sample, if you like what you hear, take my word for it and purchase it, if you don't like it, that's fine. And if you're skeptical, that's actually quite an understandable feeling when looking into ICP. But that feeling should soon wear off once you hear this classic. Peace.~Raw Hide.Legs Diamond appears courtesy of Psychopathic Records. I'm not a big ICP fan, but this is good early stuff.  Can't compare overall to their other CD's but it's good if you like murder rap Riddlebox is my alltime favorite ICP album, no wait it's my favorite album in the world. I usually find myself lost in the lyrics and wondering. Why criticise ICP? Their music doesn't compell people to commit crime, or incourage violence. It calms down the urge to. Hard to explain but Real Juggalos get my drift. I highly recommend this album to anyone who even remotely likes ICP. It is a classic, and the remix to Chicken Huntin is awesome. Toybox is really good too. If you like ICP, this is the album to have. One final word. SCREW EMINEM!! As far as ICP goes, these guys are without question the KINGS of underground music as EVERYONE knows it (and at the same time, NO one knows how big these guys are.  That or they just refuse to acknowledge it).  There is NO other musical act that has done so much with little to nothing.  They make great music that is both humorous and serious (a formula that Twiztid also uses), and they paint a great picture with the lyrics they write.  Violent J is a spectacular storyteller, and this album is epic as far as ICP goes.  Favorites: Twelve, old evil eye, dead body man, joker's wild. As a grown-up, I don't get this stuff, but my 21 year old daughter loves it.  Go figure!  Not for the young, though!!! The Riddlebox is probably the ICP album I have listened to the most, and I can ensure you if you like ICP you should love this album. It is the third Jokers Card and has some of the most wicked shxt you will hear. ICP really work hard on all their music and never release garbage to make a quick buck and this shows through The Riddlebox which sounds excellent. It has a blend of seriousness and dark comedy which every Juggalo should love. My personal favourite...Ol' Evil Eye and Toy Box MCL JUGGALOS When I first heard this cd I flipped!! I listen to it every day in tha car on the way to school. This cd is sooo fly. Anyone who likes crude straight up the a** rap had better filch this cd. True juggalos...if you ain't got  it, you ain't true. Peace. what's up?icp are some really talented muthafackoos.  many people dont like icp but thats because they dont understand them. they were able to sell over a million records and reach number four on the billboard charts without any radio play or appearances on mtv.  that is true talent and intelligence.  you have to respect that.  nobody else has been able to do that and no one ever will again.  that being said.  the riddle box is the 3rd jokers card and one of the best.  very great songs. there's not one song that i didnt like and that didnt stand out to me.  must buy for all juggalos and anyone wanting to join the juggalo family.  and i dont believe in juggahos.  anyone who likes and appreciates icp even if its just some songs or they dont like the other psychopathic artists is a juggalo to me.  many juggalos criticize others for this and call them posers.  please stop all the lo hatin.  a juggalos a juggalo and is in the family.  anyways...buy this if you want to support real music and join the juggalo family.  MCL 4 all los and lettes and f*ck all the haters who dont understand! ICP 4 eva WiTH DA PATH 2 SHANGRI LA TRULY ON ITZ WAY ICP GET MORE INTO DA STORY  ITS A GREAT ALBUM WIT HIGHLIGHTS LIKE TOY BOX CEMETARY GIRL THE JOKERS WILD AND THE HEADLESS BOOGIE ITS TRULY UNMISSABLE......mUch lUV 2 tHa jUGgalo NatiON This is the first ICP album (or Jokers Card) that is consistantly good. It only goes down very briefly, but immediatley picks itself back up again. I used to be a hardcore Juggalo when I was about 19 (I'm 25 now) This was my favorite back in the day and when I decided to give them another listen it was like ""I don't really like ICP no more but I wonder if Riddlebox is still as good as I remember it?""After listening to it without all the Juggalo fanboy hoopla I can safely say that it's still my favorite and in my opinion the absolute apex of their musical career. I'm not saying any of the albums that followed this weren't any good. They just weren't as good as this one. But what exactly makes Riddlebox the best? First let's look at the context of the time it was released.ICP released their first album (Carnival of Carnage) in 1992. Like any first album it serves as in introduction to the group. In a lot of cases first albums are usually never topped. Because there's something about the sound of a band finding itself that usually can't be re-created. In some cases first albums are merely a ""preview of things to come"" This is the case with Carnival of Carnage.Their second album Ringmaster expands on the sounds of Carnival of Carnage with better songs, better songwriting and better production. Although I feel the album has it's ups and downs. The ups are way better then the downs.After finding their niche with their first two albums. The upgrade in production is immediate on their third album. The opening title track (after a brief intro that sets the tone) is the best title track of their career with a great beat. 2 Dope ushers in the official opener ""The Show Must Go On"" and what a kick in the teeth it is. Great lyrics, awesome music and it only gets better from here as the next track is one their best and most famous. ""Chicken Huntin' (Slaughterhouse Mix)"" is a rare case of a remix that not only tops the original, but does so by leaps and bounds.From then on it's pretty much non-stop. From ""Toy Box"" , ""Cemetary Girl"" , ""Headless Boogie"" , and ""The Joker's Wild."" The only time I feel it kind of goes down is ""Lil Something Something"" an Okay song, but the juvenile humor is kind of off putting in this case. This is immediatley forgiven with the one, two, three, four punch of the last four tracks. ""O'l Evil Eye"", ""12"" , ""The Killing Fields"" , and ""I'm Coming Home"" is the greatest sequence of songs of their career and the moment that puts Riddlebox at the very top of the heap.It's easy to dismiss Insane Clown Posse. They are truly the most hated band in the world. I truly believe if you have an open mind and don't have an preconcieved notions of ICP. You might actually enjoy this. All the Juggalos of course already know how great it is. ok first of all jlennonfan4  you are a bit of crap writing the same thing on all icp cds go away and get a life  now on to my review these cd is great can u read this idiot these cd is great everythink about this cd is great It's hard to point to a definitive Insane Clown Posse record but the Riddle Box comes pretty close. For new listeners this is a terrific intro to the group that seems to have an image bigger than their music. Which is too bad since their out put for over 20 years has always been interesting, varied and most of the time underlined with stellar production at the hands of Mike E. Clark. That production is the best part of the Riddle Box which elevates the record from mid 90s repetitive beats and samples to full blown songs with hooks, choruses, samples and sounds effects. Dead Body Man, for instance, takes a provocatively inspired ""Hits From The Bong"" beat making it ominous instead of mellow while Violent J raps about the said title subject with tongue in cheek chagrin. Most of the record follows suit and other songs like 3 Rings, Cemetery Girl and Headless Boogie all seem to find distinct infectious grooves that gets your head bobbing in no time. While the Cypress influence is obvious, ICP make it there own by adding their Dark Carny flavor and devilish humor which is evident on songs like Lil' Somthin' Somthin' and The Jokers Wild. As per usual, the duo round out the record with their incredibly unique brand of scary story-esq tracks like Ol' Evil Eye, 12 and The Killing Fields. Ultimately the entire record seems to revel in it's own sort of hybrid E.C. comics meets Black Sunday style, which, I for one, think sounds great. A wonderful listen for rainy fall days or driving around on Halloween.As far as their ridiculous reputation goes, let me say this: There was a time when when groups like Black Sabbath, Slayer, Donovan and even the Beach Boys were either dismissed or misunderstood by the public at large. Infamous for the wrong reasons but over time all these groups began to feel a resurgence because the quality of their music and hard work as creative people stood the test of time. Like acts White Zombie, The Misfits, and Gwar, ICP have a dedication to comic book, horror ascetic with a focus on the superficial and vulgar. But make no bones about it there is something unnerving and delightful about low brow enthusiasm and ICP seems to ride it like no one's business. Oh, and they have following most of those bands would kill for. If you take them seriously and think them ignorant and irrelevant you missed the point. Try the Riddle Box, throw it in a mix during a halloween party and be ready for a surprise. THIS CD, WHICH IS THE 3RD JOKER'S CARD AND SIXTH CD, IS A BRILLIANT PIECE OF WORK. THE SONGS YOU MUST HEAR ARE ''I'M COMING HOME'', ''THE KILLING FIELDS'', ''DEAD BODY MAN'', AND DEFINITELY ''TOY BOX''. SHAGGY 2 DOPE AND VIOLENT J SPIT SOME OF THEIR TIGHTEST FLOWS ON THIS CD. THIS CD IS FUNNY AND INTRIGUING. ALL THE JUGGALOZ MUST HAVE THIS CD AND ''THE GREAT MILENKO'' TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT THEY REALLY ARE TRUE JUGGALOZ. A DEFINITE ICP CLASSIC. FOLLOWED BY THE TUNNEL OF LOVE EP AND THE 4TH JOKER'S CARD, WHICH IS ''THE GREAT MILENKO''. there is nothing serious about this cd i love it and it rocks i am a juggalo and this is probly my favorite&quot;CHICKEN HUNTIN&quot; is soo funny they DiSS hillbillys and RedNeckSand dead body man is cool as weLL hope this review helps some other juggalos/ettes i'm a big ICP fan. out of all six joker cards this one was the best. the songs &quot;Chiken Huntin'&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; are awesome. even if your not a ICP fan you'll love it. it kicks ass! if you bye it you'll won't stop listening to this. The Riddle Box is wicked and the best!!!!!!!!!

Even today, This album is still held in high regard by juggalos new and old and many of the songs on this album are classics in their own right. From start to finish, you can literally just press play and kick back and listen as Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope kick dope rhymes and tell wicked stories from start to finish. Just one listen to The Joker's Wild will make you wanna own this album cause that track alone is ADDICTING and unforgettable!! Mike E. Clark as always does an outstanding job as the producer and everything on this album just seemed to click and you could even say that this album is a milestone for the horrorcore genre as i'd be willing to bet that this album was listened to by many of the current crop of horrorcore artists. Just about every single song is a classic here but the definite highlights include Toy Box, I'm Coming Home, The Killing Fields [the best and darkest song on the album], The Joker's Wild, Ol Evil Eye [A dope song that's inspired by The Tell-Tale Heart], and The Show Must Go On. Unlike much of the albums that followed this, ICP did a great great job of balancing out the humor and the horror aspects of their music as this album is menacing as all hell. This album will also probably hold a special place in many juggalos as this album was one of the first albums that introduced ICP to music fans outside of the midwest and inevitably spawned new juggalos. Although ICP were beginning to change their sound up a little bit here [as evidenced by the good but overrated slaughter house mix of Chicken Huntin], This will still appeal to those who like the pure rap side of ICP as the guitars are thankfully kept to a minimum here [ICP are at their best when they rap over pure rap beats]. If you're a juggalo or you just happen to like ICP or horrorcore, then you MUST get this album as soon as possible! Note: In 2008,The Riddle Box [Vinyl] was issued for the first time ever in Vinyl and i must say that the vinyl version, although more expensive, was very well done and it sounds great on the right record player [I know because i bought it last year]. MMFCL to all juggalos and lettes this is the best icp old school album. this album has all the classic tracks such as chicken huntin. this jokers card has the much missed icp of the old days. even though u may have lost respect for them from the bizzar bizaar albums if u dont have this jokers card then u should definately get it. so if your a new Juggalo u should get wiv the old school wicked s**t and stay down wiv the clowns. Abandon any preconceived notions you may have about ICP, cast aside the thought that the make-up and clothing they wear are ""lame"", free your mind from the negative opinions you've set against the ICP fanbase, and give this rap-classic a listen.  The Riddle Box is an audio-sampling masterpiece that also functions as something of a concept album taking you on a journey into what two psychopathic clowns perceive as the afterlife.  There's a plentiful supply of dark-comedy within their lyrics, and a few songs act as windows into their lives of growing up in the suburbs of Detroit.  One song even pays homage to the literature madman/genius, Edgar Allen Poe.If you have any interest in hearing a comedic-rap/audio-sampling masterpiece, give this one an unbiased listen and give it the credit it deserves. Immediately after death, the spirit will enter a dark chamber and turn the twisted handle of a bizarre box. As a sharp melody echos off the walls, building into a climactic terror, the box's lid suddenly pops open. What lies inside it depends on the deeds performed in one's life. If the soul becomes awash in God's golden light, he/she will be awarded a ticket to Shangri-La. However, if that same spirit gave in to the temptations of greed and vanity, then a venomous fog will leak from the box. From there, the evil perpetrator plummets into the pit of Hell, forever lost among its shadowy creatures. What will be in store for you is a mystery, as every day passes in the blink of an eye. But for now, you still have time to change the fate that awaits inside the Riddle Box.Released in 1995, &quot;The Riddle Box&quot; is juvenile in nature. While diving into the childhood chest of toys and games, the tracks' lyrics mix prank calls and carnival rides with psychotic killers and bodily dismemberment. In addition, the sound of ICP has expanded from that of the last two Joker Cards, incorporating hardcore rap with a xylophone, faint violin strings, and piano keys. Finally, after 1994's &quot;The Ringmaster&quot; instilled a gripping terror in the minds of Juggalos, this next album was intended to provide comic relief through the duo's clever narratives.This CD has a deliciously deadly slew of highlights. In &quot;Toy Box,&quot; a bullied 6-year-old boy turns wind-up soldiers and dolls into weapons of mass destruction (only to be chopped apart by his own creations). &quot;Cemetary Girl&quot; concerns an morbidly obsessed Juggalo who unearths the rotting, blue corpse of his girlfriend. &quot;3 Rings&quot; is the ultimate freakshow attraction. Deformed and demented, Violent J and Shaggy proudly declare themselves as social outcasts. In &quot;Headless Boogie,&quot; J is chased through a graveyard, falls six feet under, and enters an exclusive rave party packed with dancing zombies. &quot;The Joker's Wild&quot; is a gory game show that addresses America's obsession with televised violence. In this song, three unwanted contestants (a cop, a judge, and a hillbilly) are maimed and butchered in front of a live audience. &quot;Dead Body Man&quot; is another Dark Carnival attraction. He's a neighborhood corpse collector who lets the sickening odor of flesh permeate his van. The raunchy &quot;Lil Somthin' Somthin'&quot; can best be described as a sequel to &quot;Love Song.&quot; &quot;Ol' Evil Eye,&quot; which borrows several quotes from Edgar Allen Poe's &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart,&quot; is a spine-tingling film projected in a theater. The suspense of this track is provided by crashing thunder and the introduction of the gaunt Old Man Willy. &quot;12&quot; is a grisly revenge story about a convict who, after being sent to the electric chair by the justice system, rises from his tomb to tear apart the jury members who condemned him. Finally, &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; is a grusome and surreal description of Hell itself. As the bell tolls, J and Shaggy unveil an unholy world where wild pigs feed off the undead, storms rain rivers of blood and kidneys, and the sun's heat will scorch and overcook the brain.If you are ready to hear these tales of terror, then buy &quot;The Riddle Box&quot; when you can. Not only does it continue the Dark Carnival's lurid legend, but it also sets the stage for the coming of &quot;The Great Milenko,&quot; the master of Necromancy. Turn the crank and see where your soul is headed! Riddlebox. Just saying that brings to mind some great memories I've had with this album playing. This is one of my favorite ICP albums, though its hard to pick a favorite. This was one of ICP's darkest albums and one of their best.Intro(9/10) Sets up the mood for the album.Riddlebox(9/10) Short song about what the Riddlebox is and sets the tone for whats to come.The Show Must Go On(10/10) A song of almost perfection. Good lyrics, great chorus, cool circus music.Chicken Huntin'(10/10) Like I said in my review of Ringmaster, this version in my opinion is superior. Great lyrics mixed with great music.Interview Skit(8/10) Funny mock interview about the band.Toy Box(10/10) Kickin' song about being a nerd and making your own toys that kill those you hate.Cemetary Girl(10/10) The warpedness is great. Being able to joke about certain topics (like digging up your dead girlfriend) is what has always made ICP unique.3 Rings(9/10) Good song about being a freek show. Catchy song.Headless Boogie(8/10) Has its ups and downs. Realy good chorus.The Joker's Wild(9/10) J has his own game show and tortures the contestants who screwed him over.Dead Body Man(10/10) Also on Tunnel Of Love EP. For those that don't know this song rocks. A Juggalo fav that they play at their shows.Lil' Somthin' Somthin'(3/10) Just couldn't get into it. Never realy liked it.Ol' Evil Eye(9/10) Edgar Allen Poe-ish song about an old man with a weird eye and they kill him.12(10/10) One of the best songs on the album. True wicked s***. ICP style.Killing Fields(8/10) Creepy song about being dead and being damned to roam in the killing fields.I'm Coming Home(5/10) I'll get bashed by other Juggalos for saying this but I don't realy care for this song. I think its the music I don't like. Either way, it grows on you. I usually skip it.Overall, One of ICP's best.  MCL I'll be in a death metal mood, and I'll throw this in.  I'll be in a rap mood, I'll throw this in.  I'll be ina techno mood, I'll throw this in.  There isn't anyway about this, musically and humorously, this album is amazing from beginning to end having no song that I'll fast foreward past or hold above the rest.  Of course ever juggalo has this, and even a few goth kids, but if you like GOOD MUSIC, you should get this album. It's awesome dude! This was ICP in there heyday. In my opinion, Riddlebox and Great Milenko are the best music ICP has ever put out. The beats range from dark and wicked, such as on Cemetary Girl, to funky party beats, such as Headless Boogie. The thing that made ICP so great to listen to were their story telling ablities, and this album has there best stories on it. Mike E. Clark also did his best producing job on this album. There aren't really any bad songs, so you can pretty much listen to it from start to finish. Everybody be on the look out for the Tempest in 2006, since it features the return of Mike E. Clark! This is the best ICP cd ever released.  Every cd that ICP has released has been the atom bomb, but this one just hits like no other.  This was before the fame that Milenko brought them so it's really underground and raw.  Every song is pretty much pure hip-hop, no metal guitars like the future releases, just smackin beats.  Every song is memorable whether it be the bouncing ""Headless Boogie"" or the creepy Edgar Allen Poe inspired ""Ol Evil Eye.""  Every song is top notch.  If you are curious and want to check out what ICP is like, this is the album to start off with. Now the Riddle Box was the first Jokers Card taht I bought, and to me, its one of the best CDs in the world. I can and do listen to it like 23 hours out of a day, and I never tire of it. The &quot;Hidden Track&quot; dont excits but there are some of the best tracks. If you just getting into ICP then i requimed this CD for ya, cuz its a good intro the the dark carnival Hey, I just listened to this cd last night and I was blown away. Shaggs and J really put a lot of time and effort it this record. They proved they did not always need to cuss as much to get their point across.{There was a  lot though,just not as much}. They had some great songs and hidden tracks:  1. Riddle Box 2. Show Must Go On, The 3. Chicken Huntin' - (slaughter house  mix) 4. Toy Box 5. Cemetery Girl 6. 3 Rings 7. Headless Boogie 8. Joker's  Wild, The 9. Dead Body Man  10. Lil' Somthin' Somthin' 11. Ol' Evil Eye 12.  12 13. Killing Fields, The 14. I'm Coming Home 15. (untitled) - (hidden  track) 16. (untitled) - (hidden track) 17. (untitled) - (hidden track)I  was emersed in the background of most of the songs. It had a feeling of  techno and metal rap.I really suggest it...Peace and Love Fellow  Juggalos and Ninjas!Ryan Made in 94/95. It's a split between rap and horrorcore, my personal favorites is ""Toybox"", ""Dead Body Man"" and the deep dark tune called ""Twelve.""Although ICP is very well hated, I like stories in my music, especially with ""Ol Evil Eye"" (Edgar Allan Poe) got credit and ""Twelve."" This is the best icp album others might compare but cannot beat this one. The remix of chicken' huntin' is the best if you can get the single do it! I listen to this cd at least twice a day. ICP nail it on this one. While Carnival of Carnage was a worthy debut and Ringmaster was an improvment over Carnival, this is the album that brings ICP full circle. Everybody knows the story behind this cd, so I won't rehash it.  The only thing i've got to say is that the backing of Jive and a decent budget to work with really make this this cd work.  Unfortunately, past efforts suffer from some a very limited budget.  Recommended to anybody with an open mind.Top Cuts:Riddle BoxThe Show Must Go OnChicken Huntin' Remix3 RingsDead Body ManLil Somthin' Somthin'12 The WICKED CLOWNS did it again!!This album is really an intro to  everything that ICP stands for.  With songs like &quot;Chickin'  Huntin'&quot; and &quot;Dead Body Man&quot;, you know you have arrived at  the DARK CARNIVAL.  NINJAS know that this is a must have!! O yeah...and  eminem ain't nuttin' but a...... This is yet another CD that I was able to listen to from beginning to end without changing the track and/or getting bored. It seems as though the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Jokers cards were the only CD's worth wasting money on. As always this CD contains massive amounts of filth and profanity but if thats what you're looking for that you'll want this album. This is my favorite ICP album.  The Riddle Box is very hip hop oriented and is ICP at their darkest.  Most of the songs on this CD are really creepy yet usually mixed with J and Shaggy's strange sense of humor.  Songs like The Headless Boogie and Dead Body Man are what really drew me to these guys.  This was the first album I bought from ICP, soon after it came out.  About 2 weeks after I bought this, I bought every album out at the time and have loved ICP ever since.  I have nearly every album I can find by them along with alot of other Psychopathic artists, but The Riddle Box is still my favorite.  I highly recommend this album to all Juggalos, casual ICP fans and hip hop fans.  Also, any new ICP fans who dont have this yet, make sure you get it soon.  You will love it.  This is a 5 star album, not because it's ICP, but because it is a classic album with great lyrics and music. Case was cracked though. Music is exactly what was expected. Son was very pleased and even shares it with his friends. i picked this album up a couple months ago thinking i was going 2 luv it, well i was wrong, i mean, its not their worst but i just didn't like this album forsome reason Unlike Terror Wheel, Beverly Kills, Tunnel of Love, and Ringmaster, this actually starts them with harder lyrics, better and sharper carnival production and sounds, and had a better rock influence that followed until the present. It's got the Chicken Huntin Remix, and a lot of death and darkness surrounding it, leading it to The Great Milenko. .Im from a place where music is everything.and icp rules my speakers!if you dont have this one,I feel sorry 4 ya!listen to the killing fields,and just get faded!A must have goody. This album is fat like albert.  It's Icp's best.  My nuts itch... The 3rd Jokers card... well, it's an awsome cd.  I enjoy every song on it,except for the chicken huntin' slaughter house remix, ehh the original is much better.  But besides that i can't find anything wrong with the album.  Dead body man, cemetary girl, headless boogie all find J and Shags at their usual morbid selfs..Lil sumpin sumpin is one of the funniest songs by ICP..but my favorite song on the album is 12.  One of the greatest ICP songs ever written and it's an awsome story that could be turned into a novel or somethin, it's that good... well buy this peace and MCL juggalos This is one of the best albums put out yet.  All the songs are excellent and mad funny.  If you a true juggalo you gots to get this cd. This album is tight. It was the most widly relased ICP album at the time and personaly I think that all the albums befor were awsome but the only thing that stoped 'em was money. So If you just want to see how ICP is this Is a great CD. If you are down with tha clownz the n u should buy it cuz its a great cd. Riddle Box is truly agreat CD by ICP, perhaps one of there best.  This is the first jokers card I got and it has so far lived up to be my favorite.  I find myself having songs from this CD stuck in my head quite often.  Some of the best tracks on this CD are:Chicken Huntin' (Slaughter House Mix)Toy BoxCemetery Girl3 RingsHeadless BoogieDead Body ManI especially get a kick out of ICP's Redneck bashing in Chicken Huntin'.  This CD makes me proud to be a Juggalo.  So if you haven't got this CD yet and you like ICP just a little bit, GET IT!-GET DOWN WITH THE WICKED CLOWNS!- If you own one ICP cd, make it this one. My second favorite is The Ringmaster, but The Riddlebox totally blows it out of the water. Every single song is amazing; no need to skip anything. It is rare when I enjoy every single track but this one does NOT fail to impress. This is one of the darkest ICP cd's as well, which ads this horror-type feeling to it that is unexplainable. In any case, BUY THIS CD!!! If you are an ICP fan and do not have this or are just a casual listener, you need this. My personal favorite is tied between Dead Body Man and I'm Coming Home but everything is amazing. Kudos to the wicked clowns for making such a masterpiece. While not the best Joker's Card, this album is highly entertaining - like all Joker's Cards.ICP thought they'd be making an awesome deal signing with Jive Records, they thought they'd give them national promotion, they thought they'd be known in the entire US by releasing the third Joker's Card, The Riddle Box, with Jive, but that didn't happen. Jive released the record, all right, but only where ICP already had a big fanbase, where they knew the CD was going to sell. And they didn't even release the record as Jive Records. They've created something like a fake label called Battery Records just to release the CD, as if they were ashamed to work with ICP or something like that. ICP got mad when they knew about this, but there was nothing they could do except show them that they'd be able to sell it in other places, without their help, and so they did. This album sold a lot for an independent album. (...) It sold well because it's incredibly funny and creative. Songs like Cemitery Girl, Dead Body Man, Chicken Huntin', Toy Box and Lil' Somthin' Somthin' shows everyone this band is very singular and very creative, that's why it has so many fans - Juggalos - like us. It's not like we were born enjoying it... That's it, y'all.. Much clown love. I've heard most of ICP's works, and out of all of them, I believe `Riddle Box' tops them all. It's one of the most perverted, subversive, sickening albums out there... so needless to say, it's one of my all-time favorites.  Violent 'J' and Shaggy 2 Dope definitely earn the adjective `Insane' in  this collection. Where else can you find raps about relationships with  corpses (`Cemetery Girl')? Or a game show where not getting hacked to death  is the grand prize (`The Joker's Wild')? Howzabout a boy's deadly revenge  against his overbearing classmates at show-and-tell (`Toy Box')? And let's  not forget the `Tell-Tale Heart'- style story of a kid's plot to murder the  neighborhood freak (`Evil Eye'). You're definitely heeding the beckoning  call of Lucifer when you're blasting these works of depravity at high  volume. So crank it UP!The only thing that would make `Riddle Box' less  appealing to me would be if Pat Boone ever decided to sing covers of any of  the tunes. Scary thought.

226,450,B00000058D,"Though I didn't receive my product, it was because I put the wrong zip code on the delivery form. They were quite easy to work with in fixing the problem. This cd is a must for any singer over 30!  She is the bomb! Critical write ups of this fine record always fail to mention that Ms. Rubin does her own takes on two STING songs from his TEN SUMMONER'S TALES disc . She does a beautiful job with both . ""It's Probably Me"" and ""Seven Days"" . Kevin Eubanks (guitar) graces the disc's first two tracks beautifully (soloing so beautifully) . Toots Thielemans plays wonderful harmonica on two other tracks of the twelve here (soloing amazingly) . Steve Turre plays magnificent trombone on three tracks and conch shells on yet another (soloing gorgeously) . The Drummer on six songs is none other than Marvin ""Smitty"" Smith (playing remarkably , as always) . Alex Acuna is the drummer on three others . Dave Carpenter plays acoustic bass on three songs . Bob Hurst is the acoustic bassist on five others . Michael Lang is the lone pianist (acoustic only) on six numbers . Oscar Castro-Neves is heard on acoustic guitar on four songs . Paul Jackson Jr. does fine guitar work on three songs . Two songs are duets for Ms. Rubin and pianist Mr. Lang (playing hugely evocatively and lyrically) alone . A third , equally lovely , duet finds Ms. Rubin in the wonderful care of Mr. Castro-Neves . I'd , personally , advise you to largely ignore the professional critics of this sensational disc , as every player here is in full support of the lovely and poised Ms. Rubin on every single song . A languid and collectable keeper for the discerning listener . A great disc from a swell lady . Besides her extraordinary voice, Vanessa has the backing of Kevin Eubanks, formerly of the Jay Leno Show, and OscarCastro-Neves as guitar backgrounds. Listen to them both on &#34;It's Probably Me&#34;.Vanessa is at her best on &#34;Being Green&#34;, the muppet song. Not a great or essential cd but Vanessa Rubin has an excellent voice which lends itself to jazz. Only eight of the selections that I recognized but she does a nice job on everything.One that surprised me was ""All For One"" which is apparently the vocal version of Wayne Shorter's ""Speak No Evil"". ""Morning"" is one I associate with the late Cal Tjader. Steve Turre plays conch shells on this one .....and it works. He also makes three other appearances on trombone. Toots Thielemans appears on ""Once Upon A Summertime"" and  ""Close Enough For Love"".One of my favorite cuts is ""Black Coffee"". I read  a review elsewhere by a professional critic that said the best versions of this have already been recorded so many times and it is dated material so ""why do it again?"". I disagree since it's one I still like to hear and the bass entrance and Steve Turre's growling trombone solo along with her aside comments about the relationship with her man make it a very entertaining version.Bottom line, I think it has some very good listening to offer as some variety in one's collection.","Traditional Vocal Pop,Jazz,Vocal Jazz,Pop,R&B,Broadway & Vocalists,Vocal Pop",though didnt receive product put wrong zip code delivery form quite easy work fixing problem cd must singer bomb critical write ups fine record always fail mention ms rubin takes two sting ten summoners tales disc beautiful job probably seven days kevin eubanks guitar graces discs first two beautifully soloing beautifully toots thielemans plays wonderful harmonica two twelve soloing amazingly steve turre plays magnificent trombone three conch shells yet another soloing gorgeously drummer six none marvin smitty smith playing remarkably always alex acuna drummer three others dave carpenter plays acoustic bass three bob hurst acoustic bassist five others michael lang lone pianist acoustic receive product wrong zip zip code code delivery form quite easy work fixing problem cd singer bomb critical write write ups ups fine record fail mention ms sting summoners tales tales disc beautiful job probably days kevin kevin eubanks guitar graces discs beautifully soloing beautifully toots toots thielemans plays wonderful harmonica soloing amazingly steve turre turre plays magnificent trombone conch conch shells shells soloing gorgeously drummer marvin marvin smitty smith playing remarkably alex acuna drummer dave dave carpenter carpenter plays acoustic acoustic bass bass bob acoustic bassist michael michael lang lone pianist acoustic

228,452,B00000058L,"Beautiful Cd, sweet lyrics and soothing rhythms.  I leave it playing all night for my 2 year old son, I like to think that it is comforting for him. I danced to this song with my father almost 9 years ago on my wedding day.  It was the only time that day that I cried.  It still makes me cry as it is sucha beautiful song.  Perfect for those of us who are ""Daddy's Little Girls"" hellow this is Caroline, I did not really want to comment on the album, what I want is the lyrics to the song butterfly kisses and i did not know any other way to get them, so please do not show this message, just send me  t he lyrics in my email,  otherwise, I just love the song. God bless.  caroline This CD was given to me as a baby shower gift and honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the butterfly kisses song, but every other song on the cd is a winner.  Sometimes children's lullaby cd's can have songs that are anything but relaxing, but these are gentle and soothing (not to mention obviously religious) and what I  love most is how it so eloquently winds down. The ending song in particular is a slow, delicate piece of music that anyone could relax to.  My daughter listened to this cd every night from 6 mon. until the cd player broke in elementary school.  It's wonderful. We have enjoyed this music for many years with our grandchildren. I would always play it when they slept overnight at Grandma's. Now he/she are in their early twenties and I am a great-grandma and they remember the music and asked for it for their very active 3 year old. It's very calming and the little one just loves it. This tape was given to me by a good friend when my 3 month old little girl would not fall asleep in her own crib.  I played it the first night she gave it to me and she has slept in her own crib ever since.  Not only is it  relaxing for baby but for mom and dad as well, we listen to it on the  monitor as she falls asleep.  There isn't a night though, that we can't get  past the song Butterfly kisses without tears in our eyes thinking of the  future with her.  My other favorite song is &quot;You made me real&quot;  about a toy that lives because of the love the little child gives it.  It  is so sweet and makes you think back to when you were a child with your  favorite stuffed animal/best friend.  It's such a sweet album I will give  it to everyone I know that has a baby in the future! This tape was given to me by a good friend when my 3 month old little girl would not fall asleep in her own crib.

It is so sweet and makes you think back to when you were a child with  your favorite stuffed animal/best friend.  It's such a sweet album I will  give it to everyone I know that has a baby in the future! Bob Carlisle has a beautiful voice! His song Butterfly Kisses is very touching and very beautiful. It made me think of my childhood days with my grandfather. A lot of good memories. I love this music!  I bought it for my daughter to use for her new baby.  I love to listen to it, too.  Beautiful and inspirational songs.  Brings tears to my eyes!  A must have. My wife teaches 2 year olds & she loves this CD. She also has vol.#2. I came on this site JUST for the CD & she plays it for the children as they nap. Of course title song ""Butterfly Kisses"" has special meaning for her because of her relationship she had with her father is an added plus. Anyone with children SHOULD get this CD, you will NOT regret it & you'll want to get it for every new mother you know. My son and I just love this CD. Sometimes I actually get so caught up in the music I forget I am listening to childrens music. I absolutely love the song before I knew your name. Love it! I am getting married next year and starting to review music for our reception. I listened to this song and wept wishing I could give my father a hug. This is a song that can be shared with your father even if not during a father-daughter dance at your wedding. So many special moments are shared in a lifetime with those you love and this song represents many of those times. I strongly recommend this to a bride who truly cherishes her Daddy, as I do. This is a very nice CD for all ages. My daughter loves this and we dont mind her listening to this cd. If you're like me...most kids &quot;music&quot; will send you running for the shower to escape having it run through your head for the remainder of the day!Not so with this cd.  My husband and I both completely enjoy every song and don't mind walking around humming them hours after we heard them.In fact, you'll find that you make some of them traditions to sing to your child every night before bed (nicely replacing &quot;twinkle, twinkle&quot; and &quot;itsy bitsy spider&quot;;-) I play this for my daughter every night! It is very soft and soothing! I love it! Beautiful CD for parents as well as children. Some of the songs have such &quot;deep&quot; lyrics, you might get all emotional. I still do, especially when singing along. My sister let me listen to this album before I got married and Butterfly Kisses made me misty eyed everytime.  On my wedding day, my dad and I danced to this song!Bob Carlisle sings with great feeling and depth that the listener couldn't help but relate the songs to his own experiences either as a child or parent or friend.Recommended for everybody! For parents, singles, newlyweds, children . . . We purchased this CD for our first newborn daughter when she was 2 weeks old.  A day does not go by that we do not listen to it.  All of the songs are simply beautiful.  The vocals are so soothing.  Our daughter loves Edelweiss, Go to Sleep, and Jesus Loves Me (which I have sung to her since she was in the womb).  My husband and I love &quot;Before I Knew You Name&quot;.  It makes me cry everytime.  It brings emotions of how much you love your children before they are even born and how each day your love grows more and more. I have played this CD hundreds of times for bedtime and naps and even after all that I still love hearing it.  It was our 'magic answer' for getting our son in a bedtime routine.  The songs are sung by grown-ups and they are not babyish, and the instrumentation is well done.  I highly reccommend this Cd. I wish I knew about this song before I got married!! Ever since I've heard this song, I've listened to it EVERY SINGLE DAY!  It makes me cry every single time I hear it.  The artist sings this song with so much passion and conviction.  If you love your dad like I do, share it with him.  It will make even the toughness father weak.  My husband now gives his daughter Butterfly Kisses!!P.S. Father's day is coming soon!!!  It would be a great gift idea!! I bought this 10 years ago to play for my grandson and other grand children while getting them to sleep.  It was perfect!  They slept everytime.  When my grand daughter was in Children's Medical Center Hospital in Dallas, I mailed it to her Mom to play for her.  Well, it didn't get there, so I found another one here at Amazon.com....several days later I got the one I had mailed back!  So I've got 2..I gave the new one to my grand daughter and I have mine back.  It has the sweetest songs on it by some of the greatest artists.  I haven't found one yet to compare to it.  You will love it..I promise! I received this CD from a friend of mine when I was pregnant.  We absolutely love it!!  I am now purchasing a second one for my sister-in-law who is pregnant.  The music is absolutely beautiful and breath taking.  The  first time my husband and I listened to it we cried.  You really learn fast  how precious your baby is!! I love this. I used to have the CD when I was younger, and this was my favorite song. It's so sweet, and it makes me both happy and sad. A must have for all daddy's with little girls.

229,453,B000000599,"I love this CD. Those worship songs are on point and have truly gotten me through a lot. No matter when the songs were you released, you can't place an age or limit on good music and the anointing. This is a great representation of 90's music. This brought back fond memories of when I first heard this cd. If you like ""Virtue"", you'll like this because this is one of their best. my reason for this purchase is it blessed me when i first heard it years ago&lt; so just so happen to be messing around on amazon.com and saw it so thought i'd add to my cd collection thank god im able to buy old gospel music that i miss!! The ABSOLUTE best female gospel, R&amp;B, christian group there is! Virtue just keeps getting better and better. I have all three records and I can't get enough of any of them. You can hear their growth spiritually and musically with each project. The production on each record is airtight--only to be surpassed by excellent and compelling lyrics (the hooks on ALL of their songs are unforgettable). 'God is your Source', 'Let The Redeemed','Through Your Name', 'Get Ready','Be Grateful','If you Believe', 'Down on my knees' are only a few of my favorites. I urge everyone to get on the bandwagon with these talented ladies. There is no doubting who they are representing for---with virtuosity. VIRTUE are young ladies that have such an original sound that appeals to all listening audiences.  It's right in sync with lifting up the name of JESUS with a &quot;new song.&quot;I can listen to every track on this  CD, but my favorites have to be &quot;Take it by Force&quot; which is a  funky-hip-hop flavored tune that is not too agressive, but at the same time  infectious; &quot;Quiet Times,&quot; a song that is honest, mellow and  calm; and the snipette &quot;Lord, You are Worthy&quot; which is a soft,  angelic interlude to the second half of the CD.VIRTUE is a group that is  versitile and never boring.  They flow easily from one style to another and  their voices are just hamorinous and such a perfect blend that gives a new  face to GOSPEL music.  I recommend VIRTUE to anyone who is looking for  something that's not so trendy, but new and refreshingly different!  They  are good! When I first heard Virtue, I had only sampled about 3 songs.  Knowing that they have outstanding vocal talent, I went ahead and purchased the album.  I'm glad I did because Virtue worked with some of the tightest producers in  gospel music.  I'm looking forward to purchasing their new album.  Songs  like &quot;Let the Redeemed&quot; and &quot;Greatest Part of Me&quot; along  with &quot;Quiet Times&quot; are off the hook!  I hope Virtue keeps up the  good work! this is my favorite virtue album i have all of there albums virtue is the bombmy favorite gospel gril group there style is just amazing This CD is still one of my favorites even though the music tells its age!  ""So Good To Know"" is my very favorite.  I first had this CD in 1998 and it really got me through some tough times.  The CD constantly reminds me that there's nothing like the love of God.  The anointing on the lives of these young women to be relevant and effective is awesome and has been an encouragement to me as a young woman.  I had to buy the CD again today and am still as blessed as I was when I first heard them more than 10 years ago! i really like this cd because i love the praise and worship it keeps in the present of Jesus when i listen to it thank u These four talented young ladies, exude all the Christian virtues of their namesake. Through style and grace, they are at the top of a new wave of female Gospel groups. The standout 'Through Your Name' showcases their remarkable vocal abilities. This song alone is worth the price of the CD.  Virtue has no problem singing any style of Gospel, while retaining a certain level of dignity. A REAL CLASS ACT! This CD was my inspirational CD in hard times.  The song &quot;I Must Tell Jesus&quot; is just awesome like God.  My group actually sang that song too.  I love Virtue and all their CDs have a way of ministering to any situation.","R&B,Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Gospel,Pop",love cd worship point truly gotten lot matter released cant place age limit good anointing great representation brought back fond memories first heard cd like virtue youll like one best reason purchase blessed first heard years ago lt happen messing around amazon com saw thought id add cd collection thank god im able buy old gospel miss absolute best female gospel r amp b christian group virtue keeps getting better better three records cant get enough hear growth spiritually musically project production record airtight surpassed excellent compelling lyrics hooks unforgettable god yo love cd worship point truly lot matter released place age age limit limit good anointing great representation brought brought back fond memories heard cd virtue best reason purchase blessed heard years happen messing messing around amazon amazon com com saw thought add cd collection thank thank god god im able buy old gospel miss absolute best female gospel amp christian group virtue keeps getting better better better records hear growth spiritually musically project production production record record airtight surpassed excellent compelling lyrics hooks unforgettable god yo
230,454,B00000059B,"I already Had the DVD & always wanted the CD. Now the set is complete. A Must have, A great but at a great price. 2 Thumbs up. I am a Christian woman. And I love the word of God. I will let everyone know that gospel is the way to go. It doesnt skip or nothing i love ordering off this site in fact this is were i order anything i need now awesome. Every time I received one of the Canton Spirituals CD it is alwaysrefreshing to hear them sing. I would subject this CD to others, Theyare a great joy to listen too. Rec'd in good condition and packaging wasgreat. Thanks for a job well done. I'm glad I've got Jesus down in my heart!  I'm also glad I've got the Holy Ghost in my temple (body) too.  I really enjoy the Canton Spirituals!  They are anointed with the Holy Ghost and God uses them mightily!  I'm glad that  Jesus allowed this album to go forth to minister to the multitudes and I'm  again glad that I've got Jesus down in my heart!  Hallelujah!  If you  haven't bought this, please do and it will be a blessing to you, I promise!  God bless! If I could give this more stars, I would. This is my favorite gospel CD hands down. I like every song on this one. Everything on here is great and powerful. Love the opening song &quot;How Long Will It Be&quot; &quot;Clean Up&quot; and &quot;Smoothin Up The Rough Way&quot; especially.  Highly anointed and powerful. You will like this CD. The Canton Spirituals throw in a few surprises in terms of sounds with a nod to country and western and blues on this disc. Check for it. A super splendid gospel recording. This is a wonderful CD of a great gospel group.  They include many of  their best songs, and they sound their best when they are singing live.  Though they are a group of five men, their talent and passion gives their  music the power of the great gospel singers backed by full choirs.  I place  this great live CD right up there with the live music from the Five Blind  Boys of Alabama, The Soul Stirrers, and the greats of gospel music. I love this CD. it is what's missing in the gospel music field today ...true, heart felt gospel songs. There are few groups that's singing today that has the class and professionalism as these guys did. Thank you Jesus for blessing me with the abililty to hear such annointing gospel. The Canton Spirituals have made me changed my life and take a closer look at my life ...I know I have been changed...it's such a cool change...and I think my Father for blessing me with such a change... Fairly good, but not what I expected.  I was looking for more traditional harmonizing sounds rather than individual sound offs.  Tradition is lacking due to the absence of old time classics. Whenever I can't pull myself together mentally or I'm angry at work or I feel life kicking me in the rear end the songs on this cd pulls me together and calms me down. I ordered the video, not the cassette.  Please do not send the cassette. This is without a doubt, one of the finest, most memorable, most loved & sung,revival albums ever !  Buy 'um ! There isn't any one that I can say who can sing like the Canton Spirituals, they get the message over, If you know what I mean.  This CD puts a lots of that spritiual feeling back into your soul.  The best place to look for this one, and other ones like it is at Amazon CD'S music department. The Canton's went 'Smoothin' into DC to record this one. And they didn't disappoint. But, something seems amiss. They aren't as tight on the songs as they have been in the past. C'mon guys, let's find that spark again. Without a doubt, if you like real gospel music, not disguised as gospel, this album will fulfil your needs.  When I became saved, this particular CD helped me in my new walk.  It's loaded with songs that could only have been given to them by God Himself.  A tribute to themselves, but most of all to the Lord Himself.  The Canton Spirituals sound better than ever on this one.  Did you know they perform live (Free) every July 4th in the square in Canton, Mississippi?  It'll be well worth your time to witness the salvation that their music will place in your life. I was born & raised in Mississippi but now a resident of Memphis,TN so i never really lost my roots. I give all the music that they have made over the years a thumbs up. Sending all of my prayers out to the Canton Spirituals who recently lost there longtime keyboard player ""BIG WALLACE"" Strickland at the age of 33. He will be forever missed along with ""POP"" Watkins,Sr. Truly the will both play and sing above in heaven with the heavenly choir.With much love and many blessings ahead,MeeMee I bought this cd for a friend of mine and he loves it also, this cd helps up lifts me in every way I enjoy listening to this tape over and over again.  It speaks to me spiritually.  It has the rhythm and beat of the blues/gospel that I love.  I recommend it to everyone.  I especially like Duane's songs. I CAN TRULEY SAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART THAT THE CANTON SPIRITUALS ARE VERY,VERY ANOINTED MEN OF GOD. ON THIS ALBUM, I REALLY ENJOY THE SONG HALLELUJAH SQUARE. IT TOUCHES MY HEART LIKE NO OTHER SONG IN THE WORLD. THAT SONG JUST MINISTERS TO ME IN A SPECIAL WAY. TO BE BRIEF, IT MAKES ME CRY. THERE'S A LOT I CAN SAY ABOUT THEM BUT I'M NOT GIVEN ENOUGH SPACE. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THEM FOR 12 YEARS NOW AND I'M STILL ENJOYING THEM. IN MY HOUSE,ON MY JOB,IN MY CAR AND AT CHURCH I'M SINGING SONGS OF THE CANTON SPIRITUALS. BESIDES BEING SAVED THEY ARE THE GREATEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THERE WILL BE NO MORE TROUBLE IN HALLELUJAH SQUARE. I love how... real their songs are. They aren't out to just entertain. They just make songs of praise to the Lord and songs that  you can learn from.Get this for anyone who is serious about the Lord and wants some encouragement along the way. Living the dream was so amazing to hear it made me feel just like I was there in Washington with them. Love the Canton Spirituals but I loved them more in Washington Dc. I really enjoy this cd very spiritualI would recommend this cd to all my friendsThis group has some  awesome singers Even after all these years, the Canton Spirituals are still my favorites.

231,455,B00000059J,"Their are many great songs on this cd. I believe this isn't his best Cd. In my opinon Live with Darly Coley is supperb. He has a song on it called BEYOND THE VEIL. Anyways anybody that loves Gospel music will love this Cd  Coley continually proves their are only a few true voices in gosepl music.  My picks are Coley, Bebe Winans, and Fred Hammond. Now that Daryl is a full  time pastor in North Carolina this is possibly could be Daryl Coley's last  Cd he will go out with class. He's proven with his vocal prowess that no  one will touch him for years to come!!!! I don't know where to start, but this man is awesome.  God really created a voice when he created Daryl Coley.  My two favorite songs are ""Even Me"" and ""Don't Give Up on Jesus"" w/Vanessa Bell Armstrong (My Girl), their voices blend so well.  I've never heard anyone top Daryl's version of ""Even Me"".  I don't think there will be one to top that.  Well maybe one can  - Tonex!  Love ya Daryl! AWESOME - Have always loved Mr. Coley's voice and wanted to add to my collection of his great ministry music I am very satisfied with the transaction. The product arrived within the designated time and in the condition stated in the description. Rev. Daryl Coley is my favorite gospel singer and this CD follows me wherever I go.  I keep this CD in my purse because whenever I need to hear a word from God he sends it to me through this CD.  I love Rev. Coley.  His music (I'm sure) is pleasing to God's ears.  Once you buy one of his CD's, you must buy them all.  God Bless. This really, minister to the soul. I always love Daryl Coley along with my son, Beyond The Veil is his favorite song. He's truly man of God. Daryl is not a upcoming vocalist,he has been there done that! God has new heights for him, and I don't believe because he's pastoring in N.C. that singing God's praises would stop! I have sang with Daryl, and I'm looking  forward to an studio appearence with him through GOD. No Doubt, Daryl Coley is an AWESOME, ANOINTED Gospel artist. He has a breathtakingly beautiful voice that is incomparable. I think on Accapella Praise (Even Me) he really shows his GOD-given vocal ability. Now I can't  wait to pick-up his upcoming album ''Silent Scream''. The description of the CD stated that is was on good condition.  The last 4 songs was no good.

232,456,B00000059M,"Yolanda has truly been a blessing to me in my time of need, hurt, and confused state. Every song that was recorded was meant for specific people at a specific time and at the time when I heard each song (I heard each song at different times and points in my life)it was something &quot;I TRULY NEEDED AT THAT TIME IN MY LIFE&quot;.  It stirred up an inner strength that ONLY GOD could have given me.  I know that GOD had specific people in mind and a purpose when He created these songs. I've realized through listening to several tracks--especially &quot;More than just a melody&quot;, that God is always there and He REALLY DOES CARE!! OMG, this is the first Yolanda Adams CD I bought waaaay back when and its the one that turned me on to her, her beautiful voice, and the uplifting inspiration that she brings. If you haven't heard it, you missed out... js I believe that Yolando was thinking about our children and their future when she wrote this song. It brought tears in my eyes and cheers down my spine when I first heard this song. It was only a few months ago during our  Black History month. I enjoyed this song very much and also our children in  the class. They are able to sing this song word to word and used their  talents in acting it out for our Black History program.  It was sich  asucess that parents are requesting us to do it again for our school  closing program so they can video tape it.  This song desires a 10+ and  morer. Listening to this cd makes me speechless.  Every song from beginning to end is able to guide today's Christian with his walk with Christ.  My favorite is &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; for he knows just what I need. I KNOW THAT I SAID THAT ALL OF HER MUSIC IS GREAT BUT NOT THIS ONE. THIS ONE IS HER WORST. I REALLY DONT LIKE THIS ONE. I FELL LIKE SHE COULD HAVE PICK BETTER SONGS. I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BUY THIS ONE BECUASE THIS IS WORTHLESS. THIS IS BAD REALLY BUY. SHE HAS BETTER ONES Yolanda Adams is a woman inspired by our Heavenly Father. My favorite song  by her thus far is &quot;Take Away&quot;.  I haven't heard none of her CD's  but she has visited my church in Fort Washington, MD., and I am truly  greatful for her words and her songs. This CD is a must, must have!  This was the first Adams CD that I purchased---let me tell ya, I was not disappointed and you won't be either!  'Open Arms and Trust and Believe' are the opening tracks--Adams's gracefull vocals allow these songs to float high like butterflies.The third track 'The Good Shepherd' STINGS like an AFRICANIZED QUEEN BEE! Adams starts this track of very, very slowly. Her crystal voice lulls and calms the listener--until the dramtic ending, when Adams lets it rip like only she can!Along with 'Shepherd' 'More Than A Melody' is positively stunning. These two tracks tie for the best on this well-crafted CD. 'Melody' alone is worth 5 Stars. I can think of no one who can sculpt a verse like Miss Adams.'My Desire' and 'Take Away' follow, each outstanding Tracks!AMAZING ADAMS! This is Yolanda's 1990's style of music -- jazzy with R&B; influences.  She is in perfect voice on each track, and the lyrics will never allow the listener to question Who the songs are about.""More Than A Melody"" is one of Yolanda's best efforts to date, and deserves a place in your collection.  Might I also add that the photography on this release captures her beauty in a way that none of her other projects have...an added bonus! I broke my first cd I was glad Amazon had this. I went to local stores could not find. This is my Bestie CD. I love everyone of the songs on this album. I have been blessed over and over many times since I first bought this album. I've been lifted up in my spirit, encouraged.  It is as if I can hear God say to me don't you give up  Denise.  I believe in my heart of hearts that God speaks so very personally  to me through Yolandas' lyrics.  I love this album so very much that I have  done everyone that is available on accomplimant tapes in church.  I am  desperatley looking for the accompliment tape entitled open arms. Yolanda  please I pray that you will try and see if more of the tapes (acompliment)  will again become available.  This is a must hear album and I garuntee  anyone that hears this will be blessed and lifted up. Thankyou Yolanda for  your obedieance to God for continuing in this ministry and blessing His  people with His music that so evidenttly comes from The Lord HimSelf.  God  Bless You and Keep you ALWAYS.  Denise R. I love Yolanda Adams music all of it and I have all of her latest cds but not the old ones.  I feel that even the young people can relate to her music and learn about who Jesus is and how God can take care of you.  This cd shows how God can surelly use an individual's gift for his glory.  This entire cd has touched my heart and I have a few more of the oldies to get but let me tell you it's worth it at the end of the day.  From the beginning of the cd with the opening Open Arms to the ending You Changed My Life, Yolanda takes us along with every note and that's something that she can only do. The first time I listened to this CD, I felt so anointed.  The Good  Shepherd and Take Away are especially two truly anointing songs.  I can  always listen to it in time of need and feel much better afterwards.  Yolanda has a wonderful voice, and with that comes a powerful essence that  will give you feelings of joy, peace, and hope.  This CD is one of my  favorites, and I plan to collect all of her CDs.  Yolanda is truly a  blessing to all.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop,R&B,Gospel,Urban & Contemporary",yolanda truly blessing time need hurt confused state every recorded meant specific people specific time time heard heard different times points life something quot truly needed time life quot stirred inner strength god could given know god specific people mind purpose created ive realized listening several especially quot melody quot god always really care omg first yolanda adams cd bought waaaay back one turned beautiful voice uplifting inspiration brings havent heard missed js believe yolando thinking children future wrote brought tears eyes cheers spine first hear yolanda truly blessing time need hurt confused state recorded meant specific people specific time time heard heard different different times times points life quot truly needed time time life life quot stirred inner inner strength strength god know god specific people mind purpose created realized listening especially melody quot god really care omg yolanda adams cd bought turned beautiful voice uplifting inspiration brings heard missed js believe thinking children future wrote brought tears eyes cheers spine hear
233,457,B00000059O,"Without a doubt, this CD is another one of Yolonda's uplifting collections.  She is a powerful singer and has the special gift of song from God.  A must have for your inspirational gospel collection! I listen to this cd almost everyday. It certainly will encourage you in the Lord. Yolanda Adam's voice is truly a gift from God. Love this and all of you music!!!!!! I purchased this CD in 1996.  I love all the songs on this recording.  The song I'll Always Remember is so inspirational and will always hold a special place in my heart. You will definitely enjoy the encouraging song, The Battle is The Lord's.  I believe Yolanda Adams is truly a gifted singer and was put on this earth by the Lord to faithfully send a message with Song and Praise.  I own all of her recordings and recommend all to everyone. I love this cd Save the World is a cd that talks about problems in our world today.  From war to homeless people this cd was released at the right time and The Battle Is the Lord's that song has ministered to me since I first heard it.  I would recommend this cd to everyone. I believe this is Yolanda's most well rounded album.  It shows off her  amazing vocal skills and her versatility and range. From the upbeat  &quot;This Joy&quot; to the highly inspiring &quot;The Battle is the  Lord's&quot; and &quot;Save the World&quot;. She shows she can handle a  latin beat with &quot;Ye of Little Faith&quot; and shows a heart of worship  on the gorgeous &quot;Let Us Worship&quot;, which is probably my favorite  on the album. &quot;I Will Always Remember&quot; is also very moving. The  mark of a great album is can you listen to the whole thing repeatedly and  this album is definitely that.  The best thing to do- by this album and set  aside time to listen to it and you will understand why I consider this as  Ms. Adam's absolute best.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop,R&B,Gospel,Urban & Contemporary",without doubt cd another one yolondas uplifting collections powerful singer special gift god must inspirational gospel collection listen cd almost everyday certainly encourage lord yolanda adams voice truly gift god love purchased cd love recording ill always remember inspirational always hold special place heart definitely enjoy encouraging battle lords believe yolanda adams truly gifted singer put earth lord faithfully send message praise recordings recommend everyone love cd save world cd talks problems world today war homeless people cd released right time battle lords ministered since first doubt cd uplifting collections powerful singer special gift inspirational gospel collection listen cd everyday certainly encourage yolanda adams voice truly gift love purchased cd love recording ill remember inspirational hold special place heart definitely enjoy encouraging battle believe yolanda adams truly gifted singer earth faithfully send message praise recordings recommend love cd save world cd talks problems world today war homeless homeless people people cd released right right time time battle ministered
234,459,B00000059S,"I am a long term fan of Yolanda Adams. I bought this Cd even though I owned many of the original versions. The test of a true singer is their ability to sing live and this girl can saaaaang anything!!!! I really enjoy this cd. Yolanda gives this performance her all! It's a powerful testimony of who my JESUS is, and that He deserves all praise and worship!! I truly recommend this one! GOD Bless!! Yolanda Adams has became one of gospel greatest voices. This album is so great you can feel the anointing off of this album. Even though I love Yolanda at anything she sings. But I really love her live. God Bless You Yolanda Adams. I really enjoyed this cd and I also had let my family listen to it also.  They really enjoyed it too. So I would encourage everybody to by this cd.  Sincerely Ms. Hill I first heard about this cd from a friend of mine.  Once I heard the cd, I had to get the cd for myself!!  This cd has a lot of meaning.  It says a lot about when a person is going through difficult times in their life.  This cd seems to bring a spirtual uplift upon a person.  My favorite songs  are &quot;The Battle In the Lord's&quot; and &quot;Through the Storm&quot;.  These are two songs that say that God is in control.  God is there for us  through good and bad times.  We should TRUST and BELIEVE in HIM!!!  Overall, this cd was great. I've been looking for this cd for a while Yolanda is the best female vocalist I bought 9 CD's to give out to people who are looking for some solid answers to some very difficult situations.  Example:  A good friend of mine is really going through a difficult time.  He found out his wife is dying  of ovarian cancer.  She's only 28 years old.  Even though she's a  christian, she could'nt understand why God would want to take her. I gave  her one of the CD's I bought and she loves it and so does her husband.  She  states &quot;Yolanda, you have answered some very difficult questions that  I was having about God and about my situation, thank you. I would like to  meet you before my time on earth is over, just to get a chance to see you  sing&quot;. I to have went through some very tring times, and when I feel  down or un-asure of myself, I listen to Yolanda.  Yolanda, the way you  sing, and how you put your heart into your music has touched not only  myself an my family, but everyone around me.  Everytime I listen to it I  start to cry. Thank you so very, very, very, much.  My dream is to get to  see you sing in person, and talk with you just for a monent to see how the  Lord has touched your life.  May the Lord always guide you in whatever you  do.  You are truely blessed. There is only one word that can be used to describe this live cd - Excellent!  Yolanda gets the listener to the very heart of God, and only metal would not be moved.  The song &quot;Let Us Worshp Him&quot; is my personal favourite, but the other performances are equally wonderful.  I have been listening to Yolanda since 1994 and this cd is still my favourite.  It is nothing less than excellent. The CD shipped quickly and was in great condition.  I listen to it all the time and enjoy the live version more than the studio version of Yolanda's songs.  Very happy with my purchase. This album just simply reminds you that &quot;The Battle Is The Lord's&quot; because He is &quot;The Only Way&quot;.  Remember, Jesus is &quot;Just A Prayer Away&quot; while you are riding &quot;Through The  Storm&quot;.  I love you, Yolanda Adams. Yolanda is great when she is live. I've seen her in concert two times. Both times I enjoyed her wonderful gift that God gave her.  I love her music whether it's studio or Live. Live in Washington took songs she had already done in the studio.  This was my frist Yolanda Adams Cd...so I had never heard the studio cuts. So when I got a chance to listen to her studio cuts from her previous albums. I was amaze at the fact she took those studio songs to a whole new level and made it sound as if you were listening to a new song. I enjoyed all of the tracks.  The standout tracks for me were...Let us Worship him, The Battle is the Lord's, The Only Way, Just a prayer away, I'll always Remember (Talk about Jazzy WOW!!!) and Through the Storm (MY MY MY!!!) Yolanda Adams is great.  She has a beautiful spirit and it comes through on every song.  ""The Battle is Not Yours"" is the reason why I purchased this album.  I'm 100% satisfied! Love this CD. Great praise and worship songs. You will get your praise on with this one. Thank you Ms. Yolanda Adams for this one. This album is awesome. From beginning to end, Yolanda ministers the Holy Spirit to you. Yes she ministers the Spirit. You will be touched. This so anointed. I don't know how to put it. It is sooo anointed. I loved it so  much I eventually gave it away. My friend loved it so much she gave it away  too. Because when you see someone in deep depression and pain you just want  to see them touched. This is preaching put to song. this was my first true introduction to yolanda adams... rap and jazz both being my preferred musical choices...but ya know... sometimes your spirit jus longs for something REFRESHING... something that satisfies you on a level you havent really unearthed yet...this album was that catalyst for me...dont get me wrong, i'm still fond of music that is often pointless, immature and un-redeemable, but sometimes you jus hafta give in to a higher callin.... ya know? This is a no holds barred album and it's wonderful. &quot;The Battle Is  The Lord's&quot; is riveting. &quot;Let Us Worship Him&quot; is  uncomplicated and no less beautiful. So happy I found you, Yolanda! I lost my CD and have missed the beautiful songs on this CD.  The CD was sent to me with excellent pacckaging and arrived to me quickly Yolanda Adams delivers power and amazing grace with her awesome God giving voice, no matter what I am going through I know that God will never let me down, I listen to The battle is the Lord's constantly because of the deep inspiration this song holds, I promise you Yolanda can make you feel like you are not alone....this is for sure an inspirational c.d!... Thank you Yolanda Would highly recommend this one as part of your Yolanda collection.  It is a classic live performance where you can play it anytime and go into worship mode. This CD is great.  The bass runs are over the top.  Yolanda, the singers and the band let us know that Jesus is the Only Way! The ultimate way to determine the authenticity of any artists talent is to hear them live.  This album leaves you without any doubt that Yolanda's talent exceeds all expectations.  I bought this album hearing only one track from a compilation CD.  Literally, for years I could not get that song out of my head (Let Us Worship Him) and looked and looked to find what album it came from.When I found it I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm not the biggest of gospel fans (alot of it sounds exactly the same - alot like pop music) but Yolanda is a distinguished artist. I can pick Yolanda's voice out with only a few lines of music.This album takes me to work, eases me on my breaks, gives me a pep in my step on my way home, and puts ease in my heart in the evening. Sometimes it gets me in the mood before I go out dancing on the weekends (she's just good like that)If you're like me and consider yourself a beginner in Yolanda's music, or gospel music for that matter, this is the album that you need to own.  She's a little R&B;, alot of spirituality, a touch of jazz, and fully blessed with a wonderful voice.  Don't download it.  Buy it.  It's worth the price!","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop,R&B,Gospel,Urban & Contemporary",long term fan yolanda adams bought cd even though owned many original versions test true singer ability sing live girl saaaaang anything really enjoy cd yolanda gives performance powerful testimony jesus deserves praise worship truly recommend one god bless yolanda adams became one gospel greatest voices great feel anointing even though love yolanda anything sings really love live god bless yolanda adams really enjoyed cd also let family listen also really enjoyed would encourage everybody cd sincerely ms hill first heard cd friend mine heard cd get cd cd lot meaning says lot person going difficult times life cd seems long long term term fan yolanda adams bought cd original original versions versions test true singer ability sing live girl really enjoy cd performance powerful testimony jesus deserves praise worship truly recommend god god bless bless yolanda adams gospel greatest voices great feel anointing love sings really love live god god bless bless yolanda adams really enjoyed cd let family listen really enjoyed encourage cd sincerely hill heard cd friend mine heard cd cd cd lot meaning says lot person difficult times life cd seems
235,460,B0000005AJ,"I haven't heard the whole CD, but the songs that I did listen to I liked, such as &quot;He Set Me Free&quot;, &quot;I Will Never Leave You&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Tell It&quot;. That last song talks about testifying about the goodness of Jesus and what He's done for you. Gospel means &quot;good news&quot;, and we (those who know and serve the Lord) should spread the &quot;good news&quot; about Jesus and all that He's done!! This is the last recording by the original members of the group. As does the preceding recordings, it exemplfies the unique Commissioned blend of Gospel, Soul, Funk, &amp; Praise/Worship. Prior to it's first break-up,  Commissioned was the most versatile Male Gospel Recording Group ever. Each  of the four vocalists have distinctive styles. The demise of the original  six, although dissappointing, was understandable. Too much talent in one  package. if you are an commissioned fan you need to get this cd i love all there cds  these are collectables so youneed to grab  all there things classic group The younger gospel listener today may have no idea but Fred Hammond wasn't always a solo artist. He's one of many who got his start in this male R&B;/gospel act including Michael Brooks and Keith Staten (from this lineup), Parkes Stewart (from an earlier lineup), and Marvin Sapp (he'd join the band on their next outing). The band tried to function as a collective with lead vocal duties split nearly equally (except for drummer Michael Williams) and in many cases a song's writer chose to let someone else sing it. Vocally, this gave them a tight harmony blend as they learned each other's writing idiosyncracies.Musically, the band has a bit of an identity crisis. When they focus on new jack swing style R&B; sounds they do well but they often introduce formulaic saccharine balladry that threatens to put the listener to sleep. They sometimes forget a song can be ""slow"" without being lifeless.HIGHLIGHTS:""He Set Me Free"" starts the disc off in great fashion with a Keith Staten vocal. The song kicks into overdrive toward the end as the band proclaims ""Whom the Son has set you free, you know, he's free indeed"" and Staten growls out ""In Jesus Christ you're free for sure"". A skittering drum pattern carries ""I Will Never Leave You"", a Parkes Stewart and Mitchell Jones penned mid-tempo assurance of Christ's commitment. ""Let me Tell It"" is a bouncy tribute to the Great Commission. (""All the Lord's done for you/you're tellin' me you don't have nothin' to say?/You can't tell it/Oh, let me tell it.."") It has one of the best call and response arrangements on the disc. ""Everlasting Love"" is one of the rare times they hit upon a ballad that works. Its sax is smoothly soulful, adding a jazzy tinge to the tune where on other songs it feels more like ""Kenny G."" territory. The arrangement also doesn't plod, allowing the drum machines to give it a bit of movement.LOWS:""Back to my First Love"" is the worst offender in the sugary sweet category. It crawls at a snail's pace and suffers from a weak hook.BOTTOM LINE:The production is very VERY 80s with synths, drum machines, and reverb galore. If you were (or ARE) a New Edition/Bobby Brown fan, this is a more ""sanctified"" New Jack sound. Skip most of the ballads, though.3 1/2 stars I remember the first time that I heard this album.  I was in a record store looking for some new music, and they were playing this album.  So I asked the clerk what were they playing and he told me, ""Oh...that's Commissioned!""  And he took me to the rack and showed me where it was and I bought the tape.For years, the songs on this album, especially ""I Am Here,"" have been some on my favorites.  So when I saw that I could order the CD at such an affordable price, I jumped at the opportunity.  And I have not been disappointed!!! How anyone could rate this anything less than a five star is BEYOND me! After coming across this online and reading reviews that short change this album, I have to write a review to fully persuade newcomers.  This album is annointed fun. It helped define who I was spiritually when it was released. Music has not been the same since with few exceptions. If you don't get it at first, listen again. Maybe it just needs to grow on some folks but for me, this is classic COMMISSIONED and a gift from the Holy One Himself. Thank you Lord for these guys. Lost this CD 15 years ago and I'm very happy to have it again!! CD was received fast and in perfect condition. I LOVE IT!! I have loved these guys since the early 90s.  I bought the CD to replace a cassette :) so good Once again...gospel music's legendary super group releases another cutting edge album that will raise the standard of contemporary gospel music for years to come.State Of Mind is by far the one of the tightest albums/cds Commissioned has ever recorded and as one of the other reviews mentioned, it is the last album by the original six. This album showed the world what Commissioned was all about. The whole album is tight! My favorite tracks are ""One Step After Another"", ""I Am Here"", ""Let Me Tell It' and ""Everlasting Love""These brothers continue to hit us with their silky smooth trademark harmony (which by the way has inspired the sound of numerous R&B; groups such as Boys II Men, Jagged Edge and 112 to name a few). But, make no mistake about it, this is not just a lot of ""ear candy"" or nice music that'll make you pat your feet and clap your hands. The production on this album is top notch the music is well written and executed and the lyrics are so powerful. Not only do the words to the songs minister to your spirit but they ""get right in yo' face"" and challenge you to draw close to the Lord and get to know Him in a more intimate and real way.That's what Commissioned has always been about. These brothers are truly commissioned by God to spread the gospel through music to a lost and dying world.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If you would like information about the only Commissioned fan club on the internet email me. This cd is one of the best cd's created by Commisioned. No doubt you can listen to this cd straight through. It offers uptempo and great slow paced songs. featuring the hit classic ""Let me tell it"". and my personal favorite, ""the way you love me"" This cd is the bomb. Commissioned rocks forever!!!1 First and formost do not listen to people who say that any Commisssioned ballad(slow song)moves at a snails pace. You can go to any one of their albums before State Of Mind and hear how the harmonies is always off the hook. This last reviewer is not a REAL fan of Commissioned. Yes this album/cd is last of the original six but the song quality never lacks. Take ""I Am Here"" and ""Back To My First Love"" R&B groups (Jagged Edge, Jodeci, Boyz II Men etc) admitted to coping their style. Commissioned along with other groups(The Winans etc) have set the bar high for others to follow. Hey! don't let me say it all; get the cd for yourself and find out why this will always be a group you can't stop listening to.","R&B,Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Gospel,Pop",havent heard whole cd listen liked quot set free quot quot never leave quot quot let tell quot last talks testifying goodness jesus hes done gospel means quot good news quot know serve lord spread quot good news quot jesus hes done last recording original members group preceding recordings exemplfies unique commissioned blend gospel soul funk amp praise worship prior first break commissioned versatile male gospel recording group ever four vocalists distinctive styles demise original six although dissappointing understandable much talent one package commissioned fan need get cd love cds collectables youneed grab things classic group younger go heard cd listen liked set set free free quot quot leave quot quot let tell quot talks testifying goodness jesus gospel means good good news news quot know serve lord spread good good news news quot jesus recording original members group preceding recordings unique commissioned blend gospel soul funk amp praise worship prior break commissioned versatile male gospel recording group vocalists distinctive styles demise original understandable talent package commissioned fan need cd love cds collectables grab things classic group younger
236,463,B0000005AR,"When I was born again back in 2009, this was the first album I bought. I got rid of the secular music and was listening to him on Pandora. Numerous tracks from this album were being played. I enjoyed Fred's voice in his adoration to the Lord, the jazz influence and most especially the freedom to shout, sing, clap, dance and weep in God's presence that this music brings. The song &#34;When the Spirit of the Lord&#34; was played at the church I was going to and the Lord taught me how to worship there. He said if I could dance for devils in a mosh pit, I should surely be able to dance for Him. Every track is good on here, it flows wonderfully. I have favorites though, so I pass over certain tracks at times. &#34;When the Spirit of the Lord&#34;, &#34;Oh Give Thanks&#34;, &#34;Keeping My Mind&#34;, &#34;No Weapon&#34;, &#34;Blessings & Honor&#34;, &#34;Promise Keeper&#34;, &#34;Draw Nigh&#34; and &#34;Prodigal Son&#34; are highlights. I recommend this to anyone who wants to freely worship the Lord in His presence and is tired of frequently hearing popular songs revamped. The musicianship quality is excellent as well. Harmony, melody, grace. Enjoy it! I am blessed every time I hear the Spirit of David cd. This cd is full of the anointing and spirit of GOD. I was glad to receive the cd so quickly and thanks for the nice note and the extra cd that was enclosed as well I appreciate it good doing business with you. Beautiful and uplifting songs, easy to memorize and sing throughout the day. You'll want to dance to some of them! Such a unique praise sound from Fred Hammond and Radical For Christ.  My initial CD was damaged and this is worth a second purchase. I love this CD. The Best of the Fred Hammonds songs are on this CD.I would recommend to anyone I enjoy all of Fred Hammond's music, he is the best at what he does and it is for the whole world to enjoy no matter what genre of music they listen to. The Spirit of David is truly a worship cd I enjoy because I know it's from the heart. I will definitely buy the rest of his music from Amazon to complete my collection. I give this CD 5 stars, and it would be more if they were choices.  This CD was a blessing to my family in a VERY difficult time.  I is infused with faith, hope, and deliverance.  We actually wore out the CD.  Yes that is possible.  I found it again, again, at a very trying time.  I play it all day, sometimes all week with an occasional break.  BUY IT!  You will be blessed beyond earthly measure. I just ordered a CD to replace my original.  I love this CD, because the Word of God is weaved into the lyrics.  I do a lot of writing, and I will listen to this CD while I write.  It is truly inspirational.  I think it's the best CD that Fred has ever done.  I don't see how he could ever top this one.  The music transcends generations..young people, and old folk alike love this music.  Some contemporary Gospel Music has good rhythm and melody, but no anointing.  Every cut on this CD is anointed.  Every one..... The music is timeless.  It will still be relevant 50 years from now.This CD will always be in my collection. I recently purchased this CD and I cant stop playing it.  I especially love the song No Weapon and Draw Nigh.  Keep up the awesome work . I really love the. Quality of this product, and the fact that i received it so fast. I have really enjoyed my cd l, i listen to it each and every day This CD is most wonderful and consist of high praises to the glory of God.  I enjoy it so much.  I have a cassette tape that is worn and I needed a CD to my surprise it was available on CD.  Thanks! i just had to add this cd to my collection.  i've been a fan of fred hammond's for some time now.  this was my second cd that i heard from him way back in the mid 90's and it still is awesome til this day. This one of my very favorite worship CD's. It's one of my &#34;go to&#34; CD's when I want to get lost in worship.  Love Fred Hammond! Where should I start.This entire CD is AWESOME! Fred Hammond is truly The Sweet Psalmist of America! When you listen to this cd, be prepared to go to another level in your worship experience. I love every song on this cd especially breathe into me Oh Lord, keeping my mind on Jesus, the entire cd is great. I would also like to add that this album is truly anointed by God! I have two sons that love rap music,They have never voluntarily listened to any gospel music,(they listened to it when i played it ) When I played this Fred Hammond cd, my sons kept it on repeat all nightlong! this cd honestly is my favorite favorite cd of all time, I love Fred Hammond's music! Everything about this album is worshipful.  The Spirit of David is an amazing concept to base the album on and we can see Fred as a Psalmist earnestly talking to God and telling him how good he is.The CD starts out amazingly with the first 3 songs, When the Spirit of The Lord, Oh Give Thanks, and my favorite Shout Unto God.  The songs grab my attention and are fun and easy to learn.  The CD then moves into Keeping My Mind, a mid-tempo easy song to listen to.  Next is No Weapon which is a classic and then Blessings and Honor, which is a simple song.  Then Dwell, a nice song and Promise Keeper another favorite.  Fred's writing shines on Promise Keeper and it is just a beautiful song with a beautiful arrangement.  Even the Interlude, The Lord Is Good, sounds awesome with the harmony.  Draw Nigh, and Breath Into Me Oh Lord are wonderful worship songs.  Draw Nigh sounds like Fred worshipping with a mic in front of him.  Then Prodigal Son reminds us that we are never to far and that God is waiting for us.  Call me righteous is a great song to end the album with and it is a fun song.This is the album to get from Fred, either this or Pages of Life I&II.;  Don't get me wrong, his new stuff is good, but definitely not as good as those two albums. This is where it really started for Fred and RFC. Their first project wasn't really all that good to me, except for a few songs. The production work was not as polished and the vocals were shaky at best. On the ""Spirit of David"" project, I felt that RFC really began to get an identity. On the first project it still sounded like Fred was writing for Commissioned. With ""Spirit of David"" Fred began to experience some real success as a solo artist. This album was the Bomb! Anybody remember ""No Weapon""? Churches still sing that song to this day. That along with ""Keeping My Mind"", ""Draw Nigh"", ""Breathe Into Me Oh Lord"", ""Prodigal Son"", ""Promise Keeper"", and ""Call Me Righteous"" are the best songs on the album. The other songs are pretty good also, I just like these songs better. I must have rewinded ""Keeping my Mind"" at least 10 times the first time I heard it. This is by far my favorite song on the album. ""Breathe into Me Oh Lord"" is running a close second. These songs were so inspired by the anointing it's not even funny. God really inspired Fred on this one. Furthermore, this album really cemented his title as a ""Modern Day Psalmist"".If you don't have this CD, then you need to buy it or borrow it and listen to it just once. Either way probably end up buying it anyway. Peace and Blessings Rated: 4.9 Stars...to this album and you will not be disappointed.1. The Spirit of David [unrated 0:28]2.

This album is a CLASSIC. I think this was my first introduction to Fred Hammond. This or either Inner Court which I had on Cassette Tape. Forgive me it's been awhile. Well it was sometime in the late '90s and I was hooked. When you hear a song as powerful as 'No Weapon' it's hard not to be (that song is practically 6 stars). Though he worked with Collaborators Fred had a hand in writing Almost every song on this album. I don't know if i'm really expressing how much I really love this album but you can see from my ratings that I find it amazing.There's no better album to introduce your self to Fred Hammond and his way of Praise and Worship. This is a a MUST OWN. If you don't have it, BUY IT. Do yourself that favor. What can I say this is unfortuately my First Fred Hammond.  I heard Commission over the years.  I knew their music was so untraditional and so Blessful and Anointed.  You just know God is speaking to you with this Album.  I LOVE, LOVE THIS ALBUM.  IT IS SUPREME.  Fred really told a story that God was laying on his heart that is translated in this Album.  I still have this album and listen over and over again.  It is truly a classic.  There is not a song I don't enjoy, embrace and gift lifted up too.I enjoy the most:The Spirit of DavidOh Give ThanksShout on to the LordNo WeaponDraw NighBlessing & UnderPromise KeeperBreath unto to me LordCall Me RighteousLo Am I unto youSuccess Is In Your HandPraise God for the Gifts He Has Bestowed to This Mighty Man of God.!I encourage everyone to purchase this CD.  This CD will lift you up and it tells a story about the Promises of God and His Mercies.  Go Purchase this CD.Thank You Fred Hammond-God Bless You! We sometimes forget that anything we do from housework, driving, earning a living can be done in praise of the Lord. This cd helps to make that connection. You want to get up and dance like David in praise of the lord. I can say absolutely nothing bad about this cd.  Fred Hammond is great at his gift and this album proves it. I really love this cd. It is old but anointed so therefore it really never gets old.It cme in the stated condition. Thank you seller and keep up the great work! Awesome and I will purchased other products from Amazon.com.  I am impressed with the low price and the quick turn around time. Fred has been given  gift of worship. If you arenot a worshipper or you don't desire to have it don't waste your time. If you are ready to go to another heavenly realm , I tell you this is where it starts. Though the C.D. has been out for a while good things never get old. Just ask the person who wrote the bible!!! This is one of my all time favorite cds! My parents played it when I was a child, I'm thankful for it, and it remains in my top 5 to this day. This album is an inspiration and has a powerful annointment! I feel the prescence of God every time I listen to it! I enjoy listening to his CDs, because he sings The WORD of GOD. I purchased this for someone else. They enjoyed it. Awesome for praise and worship...I love this man! He knocked it out the park with Prodigal Son. He sings from his sole and it reflects in his music... This album is the best album by Minister Fred Hammond yet. Im only fourteen and i love this album. No mistake i love all of his albums from &quot;I am persuaded&quot; to Purpose By Design&quot;, but this is the best one yet. Every song on this album is really based out of the book of Psalms, and has a section to it. Praise &amp; Thanksgiving, adversity and triumph,  restoration and justification.  He has wonderful, songs on that album, my Personal favorites are songs on there are the little prelude type songs. &quot;Sucess Is In your Hand&quot; (Psalm 37: 4 &amp; 5),though it is only like a minute long it is nice, &quot;Lo i am with you&quot;(Psalm 23:6), Draw Nigh (Psalm 34:18),&quot;Keeping it stayed on Jesus&quot; (Excellent Song) &quot;Oh Give Thanks&quot; (Psalm 136) and You Called Me Rightoues. Hands Down this Album Has to be the Best. We would just have to wait untill September 10, 2002 to see if his new album &quot;Speak Those Things&quot; comes out. I bought this tape in 1997 after seeing Fred on TV singing ""No Weapon"".  And at the time I didn't really even know who Fred was.  Wow!  I had no idea this tape would change my life.  It is anointed and life-changing worship music.  I wore the tape out in my truck as I drove to and from college and work in the late 90's.  I have since bought every Fred Hammond album since then.  I agree that this IS Fred's best album, and I would STRONGLY recommend it to anyone.  It will bless you tremendously and teach you how to be a true worshiper.I have misplaced the tape now (it's so worn out I don't think it will play anymore) so I am going to order it on CD finally.  My favorite songs on this album are ""O Give Thanks"" ""Spirit of David"" &  ""Blessing & Honor"".  ""Blessing & Honor"" is so anointed it will send chills down you.  I would like to even play that song at my wedding later this year.Buy this album Ya'll. THIS CD IS AWESOME. EVERYBODY SHOULD BUY THIS CD. THIS IS A WORSHIP CD AND I LOVE IT AND YOU WILL TO WHEN YOU BUY IT. ALL OF THE SONGS ARE OFF THE CHAIN. THERE IS NOT ONE SONG THAT I DO NOT LIKE. THE SONGS ARE FILL WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND I LOVE IT. THIS CD IS WAYYYYYYYYY BETTER THAN THE LAST CD INNER COURT. THIS CD SOUNDS BETTER AND GOT BETTER SONGS IN MY OPINION. I DONT KNOW IF YOU DONT KNOW WHO FRED HAMMOND IS BUT IF YOU DO THEN YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME WHEN I SAY THAT HE IS ONE OF THE BEST GOSPEL ARTIST IN THE INDUSRTY. THIS MAN IS OFF THE CHAIN. I LOVE ALL OF HIS MUSIC EXPECT INNER COURT. THIS CD WILL BLESS YOU FROM YOUR HEAD TO YOUR TOES. YOU WILL BE BLESSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I actually had this CD growing up and decided to purchase another one since my original one got replaced. Mr. Hammond never disappoints. This CD really takes you through the life of a believer (ups and downs). Highly recommended for someone who just gave their life to Jesus Christ. I already own this CD, but I selected it because it ministered to my son who is a new Christian & wanted him to have it in his music library. Every song Fred Hammond sings I give a 5 star. His voice is Anointed and He loves yo worship The Lord. Incredible praise and worship CD. Timeless. I listened to this years ago and it still has the same powerful annointing. this was one of fred hammonds best recording,it is so worth buying all the songs are anointed. a very good cd buy it you wantbe disappointed. I was introduced to Minister Hammond's message through the Spirit of David...I put it in 3 weeks ago and I can't get enough. I have read Psalms and called on the words but the meanings are now embedded in my soul through song. Thank you Jesus for blessing this artist and this choir with your message. I encourage everyone to let Jesus in your life through this ministery. My only problem is keeping the CD in my office,it seems to disappear when things are not going well..I wonder why!! This is a great gospel album by my favorite gospel singer! Fred Hammond composes gospel music that is spiritually moving and God inspired. The spirit of David was was channeled  when I listened to this cd.  Fred Hammond has articulated the psalms beautifully and David's voice as a psalmist is truly felt! This album is anointed. It takes you closer into the inner courts of God. Each song has a purpose, each song has a theme, no matter what you are going through God can speak to you through this album.Fred God's grace  is upon you may you continue to swim in His Glory.Love your Brother Well, well, well,this is an album to write home about. There is so much Christian music but alas! how many will bring you to a place of tears and worship.?? This album has humbled me so much. The messages are clear and not drowned in background noise...the music is sincere. This album can actually convert someone....it just grips your heart, even the hardest of them.  It needs abit of getting used to because its not average music...it is above average. Fred is truly a worshipper and not just in business. I rate it 5 stars. If you have not heard it....what are you waiting for????? i've owned this cd forever, but it had so many scratches that i bought another one. still one of my faves. Had been looking for awhile.  So glad I found it and got it at such a good price.  Excellect cd I let a friend who is not even saved nor does he listen to gospel music, listen to &quot;Breathe Into Me O'Lord&quot;.  Before I left his house, he asked to make a &quot;dub&quot; of it...Praise God!!We love you Fred!!! I love music by Fred Hammond.  He keeps it scriptural and rightly divided.  We need more Christian musicians like him. THIS CD IS THE BEST ONE!!! I have just about all of his CD's. I grew up with Fred when he sang with Commissioned (along with Marvin, Mitchell, Keith, and all the rest). He also used to play for the Winans. This IS a meditation CD-meditation on God's Word. This CD pulled me through some tough times in my teen years. It encouraged me to hold on when I wanted and tried to take my life from this earth. God speaks through this man in this CD. All the other ones are really good, but this was the chainbreaker. I am a worshipper, and I can really relate to his worship songs. I love every last one of these songs--they're all my favorites!!! Fred and I sing duets all the time (meaning I sing with the CD). There are many, many Christian artists, but only few have the Anointing in each and every song. I wore this CD out and now have to buy a new one. (Yay!!) Fred, I love ya, man, I am your biggest fan, and may God continue to bless you in your career--please, don't stop making worship songs!!!!!!! In my opinion Fred Hammond's earlier work is his best or at least as good as everything that has come since.There are osme incredibly anointed songs on this disc, particularly the worship songs....this is the Cd that contains &#34;No Weapon&#34;, Classic RFC. Do yourself a favour, buy this CD. This album is a very good album, if you are having rough times during your week or just do not have your mind on the right things; this is the album to have.  It is very encouraging, uplifting and motivational.  It is also helps to build a stong awareness regarding ones faith in Jesus Christ.  This is definitely an album to have. The CD came quick, and this is the second one I've ordered.  I love Fred Hammonds vocals, and this is one of his more inspirational CD's. This album is a great inspriration in my life. Fred blends modern gospel with modern r&amp;b riffs. His music is designed to grab the youth and all adults alike. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who needs encourgement. It is 13 years later and this cd is still full of the annointing of God! My boyfriend and I use to worship together with this cd but we broke up. 15 years later today we celebrate our 2 year anniversary and this cd is what I will have playing all day!!

237,464,B0000005BO,"This is another favorite item from Pastor Hezekiah Walker.  This CD will never grow old. The gospel music is great for any church service.  The song, ""Christ Did It All"" has a great saxophone solo in it. I love this choir but like their later projects better than this one. I did like some of the songs on this recording. God used this album to draw me into a relationship with Jesus Christ back in 1994.  16 years later, I am still serving Him...and will download this album to my iPod and remember those great early days of my faith! This is an old CD, but I must say the songs are still current!  That's when you know you have good music and I love the whole CD!  Do yourself a favor and get this one! i was looking through my tape collection when I have ran accross this cd. I put it in my tape player and almost had an accident driving. This CD is full of God's sprit from the beginning until the end. It opens up with the Jazzy but churchy song Christ Did It All. Min. Kirvy Brown then takes the mike and makes everyone wants to make it to that city. Calling My name is a very emotional ballad led by Timothy Figruoe. It shows that even though we may fall millions of times, God is still calling and welcoming us back home. Sis. Monique Walker did no waste no time letting the anoiting fall on her on the song Let the Glory which she led previously on the Focus on Glory album. Even though the song is 13 minutes long, she does note bore you but when she is through singing that song, it will make you want to get up and shout. If you are a true Hezikiah Walker fan, this is the album for you. THIS IS MY FAV HEZ ALBUM, I LOVE EVERY LAST SONG, THE WHOLE ALBUM HAS GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF PLAYS ON MY MP3 PLAYER AND IM GLAD THET WON A GRAMMY FOR THIS HIS KEYBOARDIST IS AWESOME, EVEN THOUGH THEY DONT MAKE MUSIC LIKE THIS ANYMORE IM GLAD I HAVE THIS ALBUM, it its hos best work Get ready to have church!!!! The first song will have you out your seat!!! This is 1 of my top 2 of all time!!!! This CD is 5 years old and it is still [the same price as new CDs] So you know!!!! I have not ran across too many CDs like that.CAUTION: DO NOT LISTEN TO IN CAR WHILE DRIVING!!!!! I HAD THIS A WHILE BACK AND I JUST RECENTLY LISTENED TO IT AGAIN. THE SONGS ARE A INSPIRATION TO MY SOUL. classiccccccccccccccccccccc i run this album into the ground.i had to purchase it again. Hez and the choir gave it there all in this one. And this album won a grammy award for best choir of the year in 95. ALL of the songs a great! From The start, the remake of  1990's""Christ did it all"" to the heart felt song ""Calling My Name"" to the high and lifted song ""Love Lifted ME"" To the jam session of ""I will go in Jesus Name"". Love it love it love it!! Even if your not a hez fan, theres no way you can deny that this a holy-ghost filled album! Took me back to the time when gospel was great.  My husband has not been able to stop singing . The anointing of is truely on this CD. Takes you to church and is Hez's best album which got him a grammy in 94'only a year after he got on the map with live in toronto. I first heard my pastor's daughter sing &#34;Calling My Name&#34; back around '95, but didn't know the artist. I led &#34;Make It To That City&#34; for our male chorus' anniversary around 2002 I knew it was a Hezekiah song (thx distinctive drums and bass sound) but not the album. Then our minister of music popped &#34;Love Lifted Me&#34; on our Fellowship Choir in 2009 when he first arrived, and I still didn't know the artist.Then I found the youtube video of the lyrics....was so shocked that I had missed the sign, saw the song list and there was everything...&#34;HOW DID I MISS.....ugh.*facepalm, shakes head. looks up, lifts finger chuckles* Lord, Your thoughts are higher than ours; we cannot hope to attain to it.&#34; I'm glad I got this. If you're a true Hez Fan, don't pass this up; this is one of those bucket-list albums.

238,465,B0000005CK,"This man is so gifted. After purchasing this cd I bought everyone of his others. I was not disappointed at all. I was introduced to Ben Tankard by a friend with Piano Prophet.  He makes praising God a blessing in every area of your life. Buy this cd and enjoy. Musically and sonically this a great cd. This one is in my top ten BT cd's. &#34;Tribal Praise&#34; is my favorite track. Buy it, you can get hooked on Ben Tankard, like me. THis I Ben Tankard's best cd....every song is good..

I love Ben Tankard but this was not my favorite CD.  There are great songs on it but I'm not happy with it as much as others.  I would not start with this CD.  Play Me In Your Key has been my favorite. What great worship music! I can't get enough! Wish they would play this in church! God bless Ben Tankard! Amen! Ben's music is divine.  It's very inspired and really is in a unique new category he's created called, inspirational jazz.  I love the smooth jazz flavor and the simply inspired and worshipful lyrics. The style of music is  wonderful and each CD has diverse music that's appropriate for any occasion  or mood (skating, playing, reflecting, entertaining, working, traveling,  romancing, etc.)- whatever the listener's situation, Ben's music will lift  the spirit!

239,466,B0000005DG,"This is 4Him's first album, and it is one of my favorites.  Every song is good and meaningful - my favorites are &quot;Couldn't We Stand,&quot; &quot;When I Am Gone,&quot; and of course, &quot;Where There Is  Faith.&quot;  I highly recommend this to anyone.  It will not be the last  4Him album you buy. If you're wondering about what all the fuss is about with 4 Him, be sure to grab this album.  After many weeks in the number one spot, &quot;Where There is Faith&quot; securely put the group in the minds and hearts of Christians everywhere.  They also received a Dove award for the best new group after the release of this album.  You just cannot sit still and &quot;veg out&quot; on these albums, especially this one. The lyrics are just amazing and life changing.  Plus this is one group that definitely lives what they believe.  Go see them in concert and see for yourself - these guys are amazing! I have been listening to 4 Him for many, many years and I have never tired of listening to them. I think they are the best True Christian Band even if they are not making anymore music together. Love this band.  Have been listening to them for years.  My children also listened to them when they were in their teens. I NEVER LISTENED TO 4HIM YEARS  AGO, BUT I CAN  HONESTLY SAY,THAT THEY ARE BY FAR ONE OF MY TOP THREE GOSPEL GROUPS EVER! THIS REVIEW IS MORE ABOUT THE SELLER THAN A SPECIFIC PRODUCT!I had lost my copy of 4HIM's first album titled 4HIM so I turned to Amazon to see if I could find a replacement.  After only a few minutes the item popped up on my screen and it was amazingly cheap.  I placed my order and within a few short days I received my product out of OR.  I did receive the incorrect product and was planning on returning it and exchanging it for the correct CD.  However the team at Hammer sent me an email telling me to keep the incorrect CD and use it or share it with a friend.  Then, they sent me correct CD (I received it within a couple of days of the previous) and they also refunded me my initial purchase for the inconvenience.  They went above and beyond to keep this customer happy.  I didn't have any issues with returning the disc at my own expense in order to receive the correct one but these people truly are good Christian people who want to be a blessing to others.  Thank you so much Hammer Books and Music.  I definitely plan on purchasing more products through you in the future. This is a very nice cd.  I would suggest it for listening. It is above the average for fellowship with the Lord. From what I understand, 4Him had a very short time to record this album since they were all still singing for Truth when the formed their group. Wow! I wonder what would have happened had they took their time. Even 10 years later, this is still one of the best contemporary Christian music has to offer. Where there is Faith is a top 10 all time song (maybe even the best ever). Get one of these for yourself and give one (or a dozen) as gifts.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Gospel,Pop",hims first one favorites every good meaningful favorites quot couldnt stand quot quot gone quot course quot faith quot highly recommend anyone last buy youre wondering fuss sure grab many weeks number one spot quot faith quot securely put group minds hearts christians everywhere also received dove award best new group release cannot sit still quot veg quot especially one lyrics amazing life changing plus one group definitely lives believe go see concert see guys amazing listening many many years never tired listening think best true christian band even hims favorites good meaningful favorites stand quot quot course quot faith quot highly recommend buy youre wondering fuss sure grab weeks number number one spot quot faith quot securely group group minds minds hearts christians received dove dove award award best new group release sit sit still veg quot especially lyrics amazing life life changing changing group definitely lives believe see concert see guys amazing listening many years years tired listening think best true christian band
240,467,B0000005DI,"Okay, more of those definite life-changing songs here.  A &quot;Man You Would Write About&quot; is just about the best Christian song that's come about in a long time.  Here are some of the lyrics: &quot;I want to be a man that you would write about a thousand years from now, that you would read about.  Your servant of choice in whom You found favor, a man who heard Your voice.&quot;  That just about says it all, I think.  The rest of the album is just as great - check it out! i love this cd thank you for having this i lost mine long time ago i first bought this when it first came out. I remember the first time I bought one of those amazing ""CD players"". They'd been around for a few years, but being just a teenager with no job I had to wait a while to be able to afford one.When I finally bought a CD playing boom box, I bought three CDs to go with it. 4Him's Face the Nation was one of them. I fell in love with high-quality CD audio for the first time with this CD (and two others). Oh how fascinated I was by putting on my headphones and flipping around to different tracks and listening to the most subtle nuances than could never come through before with a cassette player.With the CD player, I became an audiophile overnight. But it's funny how first impressions of a whole new thing can be tinted with the lenses of context. My musical world revolved around this album for weeks, until I could afford more CDs, and I never complained or got too sick of it.I'm feeling a little nostalgic right about now, because I found this CD in a stack of old classics that I needed to rip to WMA for restored enjoyment. Even as I write this, I'm listening to the WMA-ripped tracks, completing one of my personal favorites, ""Puzzles"". I haven't heard this album in years, and it still sounds as good (if 90's-ish) as it ever did.As an album, this is one of 4Him's better ones. ""He Never Changes"" is a pleasant song about how God's immutability. Its nuances are memorable, having some synth pads and nylon string guitar expressions and gentle vocals, yet keeping an upbeat if gentle speed as a first track. ""Puzzles"" is a declarative prayer that people acknowledge their need for God. It has stronger synth and background distortion guitars, but is a very good song, one of my favorites. ""Why?"" is a thoughtful slow song about how the mysteries of life's frustrations will not quench the faith of a committed believer. ""When the Walls Come Down"" starts out with somewhat of a synth cliche, and its chorus is repetitive. (""Where ya gonna be when the walls come down? Tell me, where ya gonna be?"" Repeat over and over again.) It is a track worth forgetting. The following track, ""Chisel Meets the Stone"", is the second best track on the album, both musically and lyrically. It's another prayer of personal devotion to God, and in retrospect I think it kept me going in my final years of high school in the right direction. Musically, it is a simple song, not one to appeal to most youth (nor ""youth"" of the 90s), but it appealed to me, with its ""chime"" and ""flute"" synth background, its double-snare beat, its ukelele during the bridge, and its vocal harmonies. ""Face the Nation"", the title track, is somewhat of a chore to listen to, and its lyrics seem to have an almost political feel. The synth work seemed a little sloppy, and I think I can hear a mistake in the lead synth line. ""Over the Horizon"", a celebration of anticipated Heaven, is musically an obvious tribute to lounge jazz, having only three instruments backing up the vocalists: an upright bass, a piano, and a soft-playing trap drum set. The chorus sung by the vocalists is fun and beautifully sung, making this song a true rare classic. ""A Man You Would Write About"", a song describing how God's favor and significance as one who serves Him is an ideal to strive for, is the best song on the album and one of the best songs ever written and played on the radio in that year. I even bought the accompaniment track and sang it at church. ""When I Get Home"" is apparently a response to the tragedy of a lost loved one, describing anticipation for seeing the loved one again upon arriving in Heaven. In my opinion, it's musically too simple to be notable. ""Every Reason to Believe"" is difficult to listen to; its boring electronic snare drum is way too loud, robbing from the melody and nuances of the simple musical production. I'm sure it could have been a great song, ""Sing praise to the God of creation..."", but I usually skip it. ""Take Me to the Place"" is a call for first love of God, and its musical direction is appropriate and gentle, but the bridge comes off at first like a secular love song, ""I gotta have you close to me."" Once understood, though, it proves itself to be a good song about one's relationship with God.I hear the first few seconds of the first track and I almost get goosebumps as it reminds me yet again of that first day when I pulled out that CD from the jewel case and put it into my new CD player and closed my eyes and breathed it in.This is a very good CD if you like 4Him's style, and I'd recommend it.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Gospel,Pop",okay definite life changing quot man would write quot best christian thats come long time lyrics quot want man would write thousand years would read servant choice found favor man heard voice quot says think rest great check love cd thank lost mine long time ago first bought first came remember first time bought one amazing cd players theyd around years teenager job wait able afford one finally bought cd playing boom box bought three cds go hims face nation one fell love high quality cd audio first time cd two others oh fascinated putting h okay definite life life changing changing quot man write quot best christian come long long time time lyrics want man write years read choice found favor man heard voice quot says think rest great check love cd thank lost long long time time bought came remember first time time bought amazing cd cd players players years teenager job wait able afford finally bought cd playing boom boom box box bought cds hims face nation fell love high high quality quality cd cd audio audio first time time cd fascinated
241,469,B0000005DU,"I can't believe I did not have this in my library for this long - one of 4Him's best ever I like this CD Album, especially the songs &quot;Love Finds You&quot;, &quot;Real Thing&quot;, and &quot;For Future Generations&quot;.  Very good music with the great message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I don't give too many 5 star ratings like other people, but I had to give this album 5.  I bought this album because I was curious and heard that they were good.  I had never at the time heard so pure of lyrics with such  a good produced contemporary sound.  Great album.  These guys are the best.  Favorite songs are........well all of them. These guys are amazing! So far I have 5 of their CDs and each one is just wonderful. Their consistency of excellence every time out is just phenomenal. All the numbers are good, but my favorites on this one: ""What Do I Know?"",""Wings"" such a fun song--encouraging, actually makes you wanna fly; ""The Nature of Love,"" and the Oh, so gorgeous ""As Long as My Heart Knows it's You!"" Kirk Sullivan leads on three of these, but the soulfulness in his voice on this gorgeous song is simply divine.I get amazed every time I hear a 4HIM song, at what an awesome gift they've been to Believers who hear this music, and what a wonderful ministry they have. A great buy for the fans of the group 4Him. For those who are into Contemporary Christian music. My sisters and I heard them first from other tapes with one or two of their recordings. We were impressed...greatly impressed. So we bought the &quot;The Ride&quot; and got positively hooked!! We've listened to this CD so many times but still can't get tired of it. The songs are catchy, soothing and wonderfully arranged that one can't help but wish we could reach such a level of professionalism in singing.

I have followed 4Him ever since they came on the scene and have just about every album they put out, as well as the solo albums by Mark Harris and Andy Chrisman.  As much as I love them all I think this is their best all-around album.  The Message is powerful and uplifting, calling us to live out our faith and demonstrating Christ to a world in need.  The lyrics are encouraging and challanging, the music is excellent and the vocals are solid.  I never tire of listening to it lively music that encourages and brightens up your day. i play the cd over and over! when you put on these songs you just have to get up and dance! ... my  favorites are window with a view and the king and i. This was their breakthrough with many big hits that deliver the message, includes:Lay It All on the LineThe Measure of a ManLand of MercyThe MessageThe King and ICenter of the MarkWindow With a ViewAll the Evidence I NeedSacred HideawayA Lot Like YouGreatest Story Ever Told I'm a stingy musician and typically hate cheesy music like this. Seriously, reading the other reviews really irritates me. But this 4Him album is kind of awesome. No less cheesy, but awesome. Land of Mercy is the sleeper masterpiece on this album. This is so unbelievably good, it's almost hard to put it into words. Every single solitary tune is not only good to the ear, but massages your 'inward parts!' It all started with a local Christian radio station playing ""Lay it All on the Line,"" and well, I needed to hear more, so I bought the CD. These guys are WONDERFUL! Mark Harris is an amazing songwriter. Infectious rhythms, great vocals, the harmony is superb, and it just doesn't get any better than this!!It's great exercise music, too--""The King and I"" and ""A Lot Like You"" are walking tunes extraordinaire. But what is slowly becoming my anthem is ""Sacred Hideaway"" -- what an AMAZING SONG! Not only does is appeal to my musical appreciation, but the Cherokee in me FEELS this song, from the opening flute, to the chants in the background, and the lyrics (Marty Magehee should be rewarded for this!) that speak of that 'special place' (my grandmothers were always speaking of 'finding your own special place') where you go for your spiritual renewal.4Him is ALL THAT! If they never do anything else, they score cool points just for putting this CD together!","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Gospel,Pop",use product gave friend thought would enjoy missed much bought new one followed ever since came scene every put well solo mark harris andy chrisman much love think best around message powerful uplifting calling us live faith demonstrating christ world need lyrics encouraging challanging excellent vocals solid never tire listening lively encourages brightens day play cd put get dance favorites window view king breakthrough many big hits deliver message includes lay linethe measure manland mercythe messagethe king icenter markwindow view product friend thought enjoy missed bought new followed ever since came scene solo mark andy chrisman chrisman love think best message powerful uplifting calling live faith demonstrating world need lyrics encouraging excellent vocals solid tire listening lively encourages brightens day play cd dance favorites window view king breakthrough hits deliver message includes lay measure king view

244,476,B0000005MT,"Christmas by Mannheim Steamroller is a gorgeous Christmas cd, this is my second favorite cd from this instrumental band. I enjoy listening to this album every December, you gotta hear it for yourself. I highly recommend it! My CD arrived when it was supposed to and in the condition it was supposed to be in.  Thank you so much! Perfect for the holidays. The best part of Christmas is all the great music. Mannheim Steamroller is spot on! Love it. I love the cd so I thought I would download it to my cell phone. That was Friday - the money came out of my bank account, but I never received the music. Very sad indeed Rush Limbaugh introduced us to Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas music several years ago, and we have loved it ever since. Sadly, Rush probably cannot hear it properly now with implants.  My husband's last Christmas before he died, we got to see/hear them in concert, Jackson, MS.  The &#34;live&#34; sound is incredible, and cannot be duplicated on any sound equipment I own, but still love their music. This was one of the first CDs my parents bought back in 1986, when we got our first CD player.  So this music has been in my household every Christmas for the past 15 years.  To me this music helps to define the holiday mood.  It has songs that tend to be more synthesizer based and others that are orchestrated.  It is incredibly diverse and is wonderful for anyone in the Christmas spirit.  If you are looking for just one great Christmas CD, I would look no further. Gave as a present and the reciepient loved it!  It sounds great playing in the background over the holidays! This is the 1st Mannheim Steamroller CD I bought!  I think it is the best one yet but the rest of their CD's are great, too! I have bought every CD they have made!  They are great! Our kids gave us tickets to a Mannheim Steamroller concert so I obviously had to add this Christmas CD to my collection! Love it!!! This is the cd you want if you want the music you here on many tv shows and on the radio. So, glad to have it. I lost this album a few years ago and had to replace it. One of my favorite Christmas albums, for sure! Strangely enough, Mannheim Steamroller Christmas turns out to be the best album released by the group.  Many of the entries in their Fresh Aire series did very well in mixing the synth and old world elements (FA 2,3,and 5 to be precise) but none did it to such a level of perfection found on this disc.  Every single one of the arrangements on this disc have become classic, and rightfully so.  Complex, beautiful, and edgy, Chip Davis really shows his genius throughout the album.  God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen (2nd version) is dark and mysterious, a perfect mix of uneasy sythesizers with horns, strings and piano.  The Christmas Sweet are all wonderful, ancient tunes that reflect the time period they came from with a new edge (Chip and Co. built many extinct instruments from the baroque period themselves for this section!) and Bring A Torch Jeannette Isabella has never sounded more restful.Subsequent releases have tried to capture the essence of this album, with mixed results; none have sounded as fresh and creative as this one.  Perhaps the only &quot;Christmas&quot; album that is worth listening to outside the holiday months, this gem is worthy of any musical collection. Although it's not mentioned much in the reviews I've read, ""Bring a Torch...."" is and always has been one of my favorites since I sang it in elementary school. A beautiful rendition like this one is very hard to come by.  The gradual addition of the high strings and other instruments taking the lead then allowing another to come forward conjures in ones mind a vision of the people of Bethlehem slowly gathering to see the Christ Child after Jeanette Isabella is asked to come and""Bring a torch"" to the cradle by an observer of the event. (The song starts out as a duet.) It's like the gatherers realize the gravity of the moment by torchlight as they gaze upon the baby.  For those of your not familiar with the song read the main lyrics and let your mind visualize.Bring a torch, Jeanette, IsabellaBring a torch, to the cradle run!It is Jesus good folk of the village;Christ is born and Mary's calling;Ah! ah! beautiful is the motherAh! ah! beautiful is her son!By the way the rest of the CD is beautiful too!  This is just my favorite. Great CD even though it's an older release but great music especially after going to their concert, a must buy if you like Chip Davis For my husband and me, this is our all time favorite Christmas album. We had the tape when it came out and replaced it with the CD. It is in our car. We listen to it every time we are in the car starting at Thanksgiving through the Christmas season. We think  the music on this CD is perfect . Ah, Christmas time is coming once again. You can already see it at the malls and stores, and you can already feel it with the cold air nipping at your skin. The 80's were a big decade for the Christmas Holiday. The movies were classics. ""A Christmas Story"", ""Mickeys Christmas Carol"", ""National Lampoons Christmas Vacation"" and ""Scrooged"" all are loved by families today, and it paved the way for ""Home Alone"" to become the 90's Holiday masterpiece that it is. The music of the 80's was Christmas pop at it's finest. Whether it's the satires like ""The 12 Pains of Christmas"" or 80's idols Bruch Springsteen and Wham! wishing you a Merry Christmas, Christmas has a special place in 80's pop culture. This CD, released in 1984 by a then unknown Chip Davis, has the right mix of classical movements along with modern day muscle.""Deck the Halls"", which opens up the album, sounds like it is going to be a mellow sounding song, but BAM, the guitars and drums go up in the mix, as do the synthesizers. It'll blow you away. The next song ""We Three Kings"" is a very soothing and moving piece. You'll feel the snow coming down peaceful on a cold winters day while inside warming up to this song. The next rocking song is ""Good King Wenceslaus"", which is a killer combination of modern music technology with classical sounds. Most of the album then is Renaissance sounding songs, and the closer is perfect with the smooth guitar of ""Silent Night"" bringing the album to a close.The one distraction, if any, from this album is the fact that this did come out in the early/mid 80's, so synthesizers were used pretty commonly. That makes the sound a little dated today, but still, the music is so beautifully produced and is so talented infused with both rock/pop and classical sounds that you won't be too bothered by that little issue.If you like this, which I don't know how you won't, I recommend picking up the other Fresh Aire Christmas CD's as well. I believe there is one for '88, '95, and '02/03? They are all loaded with the same sounding music. Christmas '84 kicked off the series, and is recommended for anyone who loves Christmas music. This is a terrific CD; it's now a part of our tradition, our favorite way of announcing the start of Christmas every year. This music was a total surprise when it came on the scene some 25 years or more ago. It hardly seems it can be so long, but of course that's just about yesterday when discussing the history of Christmas music. At the same time classical and electronic, at times very up tempo, and at other times patiently slow and beautiful, the album gave Christmas classics a new sound and a new interpretation. Many times reinterpretations of classic music standards turn into miserable failures ... not so here. This music got immediate frequent air-play and deserved album sales.It still sounds as fresh and beautiful to me now as it did then. The last song, their interpretation of Silent Night, is hauntingly wonderful, and if you ever saw the video you'll never forget the cold mountain stream surrounded by snowy banks.Highly recommended for Christmas music fans of all ages. My favorite of all the great Steamroller Christmas CDs. I like the olde English sound of this CD. It makes you think you were teleported to Charles Dickens era of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; with just a tinge of new age making it very upbeat. No bah humbug for this CD! Here, the Steamroller lives up to their name, squashing all the fun and joy out of  usually charming little Christmas carols, and, in the case of Deck the Halls, transforming it into a call-to-arms straight out of Braveheart. Every time I hear this song, I picture a million blood-thirsty vikings charging over a grassy knoll.I must admit, however, they do perform a lovely version of Silent Night (Stille Nacht). Unfortunately, you'll have to plow through ten songs-worth of turgidity to get to it.Deck the Halls?DRECK the Halls is more like it! How can I not like this music?  Plus, it can be played and enjoyed over and over, and my whole family can enjoy it. This makes for great listening, whether as background music or a present companion.  It's a staple of my Christmas music library. I have this CD on cassett when it first came out and wore out the cassett, I am so glad I found it on CD.  it is wonderful and a must listen to on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day for our family.  It's part of our tradition. Most Christmas albums are only worth listening to in December. But this is an album I listen to all year long. The arrangement of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" in two versions is spine tingling. Really really great music! Mannheim Steamroller is an essential for The Holiday Season and compliments The Season almost as much as the Christmas Tree or candy canes. This was the first Album i heard by Mannheim Steamroller.  This album is great.  After i heard this one i just had to keep up with them a buy all the new one that came out. Let me put it This Way.....MANNHEIM STEAMROLLER KNOWS CHRISTMAS!!! I love everything by Mannheim Steamroller. I've been to two of their concerts in Boulder and they are awesome.  Great stuff. After a few songs .. All sounds the same. First couple of songs very good but rest not Christmassy enough.. Good but not great. Great album.  We lost our original tape and was glad to see that I was able to get it on CD. If you love classical music and are fond of baroque and other styles, you will LOVE Mannheim Steamroller music!  They use their background in classical music as their stepping off point and go from there.  A wonderful take on what we consider to be &#34;traditional&#34; Christmas music!  Enjoy!! No problems with shipment or with product CD itself. Very synthesized music. Very 90's ish. It has some really good songs, but they are so clearly played on a synthesizer that it's a little lame.. all of the songs have orchestral parts played by a keyboard set to that sound. However, I bought this CD because of the nostalgic value - my mom and dad played these CD's during the Christmas season every year for me growing up, so it brings back childhood memories. As an adult reviewing this material, it is just a little too synthesized for my personal taste. I do like Manheim Steamroller Christmas Music and this is no exception. It brings back memories. It is a good CD. If you don't already know, Mannheim Steamroller is the cream of the crop as far as today's Christmas music goes. Mannheim knows how to blend the radical synthesized sounds of the new millennium with the traditional to create a truly unique category all its own, commonly known as ""The Best"".This album is Mannheim's first. Hence, the rather traditional title ""Mannheim Steamroller Christmas"". This group got its start publishing stereo demo music. Much to their surprise, customers said ""I'll take the stereo, and do you sell the demo CD too? Sounds awesome!"" It was thus that Mannheim entered mainstream media, quickly soaring to the top.Here's a summary of the tracks on this album.Track 1 (3:39): So you pop this CD in your player, then go back to what you were doing. Suddenly, WHOOM! Extremely cool, modern, synthesized sounds rocket out of the speakers, however small they may be, and grab at your ears. My friend, you have just entered a new era of Mannheim Steamroller, and your Christmas experience will never be the same again. This old fashioned decorating song has been invigorated and given the modern flair of synthesizers, and it is awesome. It is just the beginning.Track 2 (3:40): Done just like you think it ought to be. A Middle-East flair accompanied by background jingling brings to mind the perfect image of three ancient sovereigns as they visit the new-born Messiah. More instruments join in on the chorus to make it sound more traditional, and pretty.Track 3 (2:32): I still have no idea who Jeannette Isabella is, but the tune is done very sweetly, and quietly, with the beauty of the alto recorder carrying the tune.Track 4 (2:38): Just a quiet little guitar to offset this ancient, simple, pretty tune.Track 5 (3:29): Ha ha, hear that? If you thought track 1 was radical, think again! Once again, primarily modern instruments bang out this tune, giving it a very macho feel. These guys know unique.Track 6 (2:20): A very renaissance-sounding tune, but it's got a jig-like tempo, proving that mixing 21st century sounds with 12th century sounds is just as good as the rest. The track, still, seems only average to me, if that word can go together in the same sentence with Mannheim.Track 7 (2:03): Very quiet and simplistic. But then, so are birds.Track 8 (1:28): The third renaissance-sounding tune, there's really nothing super-cool worth mentioning on this track.Track 9 (1:37): Done at what sounds like a galloping tempo, it's upbeat and original.Track 10 (4:19) I say, didn't we just hear this tune? Not like this, you didn't! Composer Chip Davis decided to do two variations on the same tune, and I must say I prefer this one to the previous. Majestic horns step in to give this tune a very bold feel, and cool.Track 11 (5:25): Wow, what a sweet track, ending a sweet album. A quiet choir, accompanied by piano, starts the song out, and then the violins begin, adding perfect resonance and beauty. Perfect for quiet reflection, or the background theme for your family re-telling of the precious story of the Savior's Birth - one Silent Night long ago.From beginning to end, this CD is really awesome, and begs to be added to your Christmas stash this year. This, the first of Mannheim Steamroller's holiday collections, is timeless. Songs that should sound dated now just resonate with memories of Christmases past. This version of Good King Wenceslas should have won a  Grammy. It's such an outstanding arrangement and still gives me goosebumps  after 15 years. And the version of Silent Night on this disc is nothing  short of breathtaking. It's really an experience and you just have to hear  it to understand. The perfect late night Christmas Eve track. I would have to say that A Fresh Aire Christmas slightly beats out this one in overall quality, which is funny because this one contains my two favourite pieces. The rest of the tunes, though, don't match up in terms of peacefulness and beauty. It's still worth 5 stars, though.This one starts out with a rousing rendition of Deck the Halls, with a fast, synthesized beat. Since this is a jolly song anyway, it really fits. The rest of the CD carries along quite nicely, though not really memorably. The songs are quite pleasant and well done, but they don't have a lot of jump to them. The soft ones are pretty, but not quite beautiful, and the fast ones are ok.That changes, however, with the end of the CD. The end brings this up from 4 stars to 5. First, there is a quiet version of God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen, which is short and sweet. However, it segues into a really rousing version of the song. It really gets the blood pumping, and I just love it to pieces. It's beautiful, it's fast, yet it's also very poetic in a way.Then, things slow down to a crawl (but this time, in a good way, not in the usual meaning of that phrase). Stille Nacht (Silent Night) is simply the best piece on any of these CDs that I own. It's very soft, almost too soft to hear sometimes at the beginning. It then builds to a very soft, slow and peaceful 2nd half, which is where you really hear the tune itself. It makes you picture a snowy night in the forest on Christmas Eve. It makes me cry almost every time I hear it. In fact, the first time I listened to it after moving away from my family, I really broke down. It is that beautiful.You really should treat yourself and get both of these CDs, but if you can manage to get A Fresh Aire Christmas and get somebody to give you a recording of these two songs, that would be worth it too. Highly recommended. Now I'm addicted to Mannheim Steamroller. Deck the Halls, Stille Nacht, and God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen both cuts are particularly good. I must confess I was not as impressed by this CD as most people were.  I was certainly not as impressed as I am with Mannheim Steamroller's later efforts.  I know Mannheim Steamroller is known primarily for synthesized music.  But on this, their first Christmas CD, it sounds far too synthesized.  On the ""Blue"" CD (I think it's A FRESH AIRE CHRISTMAS) and the ""Red"" one (CHRISTMAS EXTRAORDINAIRE) the synthesizers don't sound so...for lack of better words...synthetic.  What I mean is simply that they relied more on choirs and soloists.  They threw a great mix into the whole project.  And it sounded great!If you're looking to purchase your first Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CD, then I would recommend the Blue or Red CD.  Those two are the best.  If you're already a satisfied Mannheim Steamroller fan, then this CD is definitely not all that bad an addition to your collection (hence the three stars instead of one).  But this is not their best.  Fortunately, though, as good as this is, it only improves from here. This is one of my favorite groups to listen to.  They never have a bad CD of music.  Love the sounds they make This Xmas album is a great cd to add to my Christmas collection. Their version of Silent Night is amazing! It definitely with ease your hurried mind, and help you reflect on the true meaning of Christmas. Love the CD would buy it again in a mininute. In great condition and would diffetly recommend to purchase. Love to listen to it brings Christmas anytime! don't have much taped music glad to find these and they were so easy to pick up (or have mailed) Great! I love this CD! It is a part of my Christmas celebration! Stille Nacht brings tears to my eyes. One of the most beautiful songs ever recorded. Everything went really smoothly! Thanks I really appreciate doing business with people do a great job.  Looking forward to more great amazon purchases.  Just love getting new Christmas music especially the stuff that is tried and true First I love gooseberry pie and can no longer buy them locally and was delighted to find I could purchase them on line. They aregreat.I also love Christmas music and this is one of their first Christmas albums and the first ones were the best. This was a replacementfor one I had for years. Mannheim Steamroller are the ultimate Christmas musical bands.  I love listening to the at Christmas & sometimes at other times of the years. Mannheim Steamroller has associated themselves with Christmas. The arrangements of old classics is phenomenal. A must have for every collection. I remember when I first heard the Steamroller:  I was stationed in Munich, Germany, in the 80's.  It was afternoon in Germany, and I was in my military quarters, shortly before Christmas, and ""The Today Show"" had Chip Davis & his crew as guests.  ""Deck the Halls"" was performed.  I heard it and was hooked.  Wow.  Had to get a friend in the USA to send me the recording since I couldn't get it at the military store at the time.  I prefer older Christmas carols and melodies to the newer ones, by this I mean the old stuff stemming from the Renaissance.  I changed my mind when I first played my cassette recording of Christmas 1984.  In the meantime, I've moved on to CDs and I've been giving this recording as presents for years.  I never get tired of these arrangements, and hope others will enjoy them as well. I was a traditionalist when it came to Christmas music until I discovered Mannheim Steamroller.  The vitality and energy in their music is tremendous.  Best of all is their double rendition of God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman, which pulses with life.  Anyone should check this out. There are few pieces of music that stir in me the kind of anger and disdain that this does.  To me, it represents everything that has gone wrong with Christmas, and the world in general-- it's trite, soulless, and disposable.  Each time I hear it I lose just a tinge of faith in humanity. Ah... it's that time of year again--time for winter coats, outrageous spending on ungrateful relatives, and the music of Mannheim Steamroller. It seems that everywhere I go or every radio station I turn to, those whacky instrumentalists who take perfectly cheesy Christmas songs and make them even cheesier, are at it again.Mannheim Steamroller has made a huge name for themselves doing techno-style Christmas songs, but let's be honest--the music sounds like C3PO from Star Wars ate some funky fruitcake and is now farting Jingle Bells. If that doesn't make it clear, not everyone likes Mannheim Steamroller--in fact the only people who do like them are my least favorite generation--the Baby Boomers. No one in my cohort (gen X) can stand the futuristic sound (for 1971) of Joy to the World or Silent Night, in fact, those tacky Casio synthesizers and toy drum sets make me and my friends want to barf. ""Turn it off TURN IT OFF!"" I have to yell every time I hear the songs start--it's creepy.Interestingly, the people who like the sound (all Boomers at latest count) really like them--they're COOL, they'll say. Well, if that's cool, I want to be as far from cool as an Indian's sweaty armpit on a 130 degree day.Yours truly,Finley Harrison, author of the nonmusicalWhy Baby Boomers Suck!: (No Offense Mom) Mannhiem Steamroller has taken traditional Christmas carols to a higher level.  Mannhiem's version of Good King Wenceslas is awesome. It puts the tap in the toe, the snap in the fingers. However, Mannhiem has top honors  with their rendition of Stille Nacht (Silent Night).  It is truly  perfection. The Steamroller at its best!  Great variations of the classic Christmas music with the twist that only the Steamroller can give. I have purchased this album a total of three times in life. Once in college when I heard a teacher playing it in her office. Someone borrowed it and never returned it. The second time I got it as a gift for Christmas, someone borrowed it, never returned it. This is the best Christmas album for new-age traditional songs set to electronic drums and melodies. I bought it a third time because it is worth it three times over. Silent night is mesmerizing! This album has a renaissance feel to it, the instruments are capitivating, and you'll be entranced. Just buy it for yourself, you'll be tempted to borrow it and never return it...that's how good it is. Try silent night on a mellow afternoon at sunset to see if this album is for you. You'll know what I am talking about. If it hits you like it hit me, you'll either be tearing up, or back here to buy it asap! This one is a life-long keeper. For many of us who grew up in the late '80s and early '90s, Mannheim Steamroller represents the Christmas season. I know my family owned the cassette tapes, and we'd play them as we decorated the tree, made cookies, and wrapped presents. Therefore, when I hear the music twenty years later, it brings back many memories.Mannheim Steamroller's ""Christmas"" was first released in 1984, and despite its age, it has held up extremely well. There are a few songs that are a little dated (the version of 'Good King Wenceslas' on here is painful to listen to), but overall the group managed to combine synthesizers with enough live music that it still stands on its own legs. The album can basically be divided into three groups: the songs you know, the songs you don't, and 'Silent Night'.The songs you know deals with carols we are all familiar with: 'Deck the Halls' opens in full synthesizer glory, though it manages to not sound too dated in doing so. There's an energy to this arrangement that that gives it a unique stamp. 'We Three Kings,' led by the oboe, sounds nearly medieval, despite having been written in 1857 America. And the second arrangement of 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen' is typical Mannheim fare - driving brass, intricate rhythms, and enough variation to keep it from getting boring.The second group of songs on here are the ones you probably don't know. 'Bring a Torch, Jeannette, Isabella', a 17th century French carol that is light and delicate, and, despite its unfamiliarity, brings to mind a still winter's day. 'Coventry Carol' is a seldom-performed English tune from the 1500s that is presented here in its bare bones - just guitars, with no synthesizers, brass, percussion, or other strings. The 'Christmas Sweet' consists of 'Wassail, Wassail', a jolly tune that is enhanced by a Renaissance treatment; 'Carol of the Birds', another French song that also is played in mid-millennium style; 'I Saw Three Ships', another light-hearted tune; and 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen', which takes on a near-Spanish flair. It is this group of songs that gives the record a lightness that most Mannheim Steamroller albums lack.The last ""group"" of songs on here is 'Stille Nacht (Silent Night)', and I've left this one on its own because it truly doesn't fit into any other group. Though it's a tune we all know so well, its treatment on this album is extraordinary. Usually Mannheim songs can be pinpointed by their sound, but this one is so deceptively quiet that when I was looking for it a few weeks ago, this was one of the last albums I checked. If you recall the 9/11 Christmas tribute that was done a decade ago, this was the arrangement in the background of the poem. I've always loved the carol itself, but so many times 'Silent Night' is done with drama and flourish, and that somewhat undermines what was originally written as a simple tune. On here it evokes images of a dark winter's night, a stillness and sacredness that truly brings to mind the reason for the season.I've generally reached for ""A Fresh Aire Christmas"" over this one, but in listening - really listening - to it this holiday season, I've come to appreciate this album for all the magic it contains. Other than 'Good King Wenceslas', my only beef with the record is its short length - but then again, most Christmas albums don't top an hour. For those of you who also grew up with this music, it brings back fantastic memories. For those who didn't, perhaps it's time to start creating memories to the soundtrack of Mannheim Steamroller. I used a particular song as a backdrop to an Xmas story which I recited at an Xmas eve service.It's a great album anyway. They have great holiday music!  This is good music to have on in the background while you are wrapping presents Mannheim Steamroller's electronic take on traditional carols is not for everybody. Souped up versions of traditional tunes with no vocals may not grab you, but I thought it was novel approach to the tried and true. Chip Davis's collection is a good mixture of mainly English traditionals, all with his original spin. This technique gets old after awhile (see later CD's) but when this came out it was fresh and new. A nice change from the basic sing along versions that had become so familiar over the years. This has many selections used in live Mannheim Steamroller concerts. Of special interest is the Renniasance Christmas music at a Christmas Feast selections. I have never found any music to top the sound of Mannheim Steamroller!!  A sound all their own, hands down!!!! I remember my parents purchasing the LP of this album during the holiday season in 1987. I wasn't familiar with Mannheim Steamroller previously, but I was immediately a big fan. Every track offers something unique and magical. Their broad use of musical instruments played in unusual ways gives way to a listening experience unmatched by any other musical group, regardless of genre.I have since purchased the album on CD and digitally here on Amazon. It continues to bring joy to me year after year and is something I've introduced now to my own children and other family members and friends. It is truly timeless and just never gets old.I would recommend this to anyone looking for some non-traditional variants of many Christmas classics and perhaps some new tunes that are unfamiliar and refreshing. This is the only Christmas I can listen to for weeks on end without getting heartily sick of it. Because there are no singers, I never get worn out on the same, old voice. This is still fresh and modern even after all these years and I won't do Christmas without Mannheim Steamroller. I am a big Mannheim Steamroller fan.  So is my 12 year old son.  I recently bought this cd for him (I already have it).  It is very interesting to listen to being it was their 1st Christmas album, especially compared to the other releases.  I love listening to all their albums, and this one especially.  It has a sound unique to it...released in 1984, it kinda has that 80s vibe to it, but yet when played with the others, they all blend well together.  I highly recommend this album, and any holiday album by Mannheim Steamroller. There is no such thing as a bad or inferior Mannheim Steamroller Christmas album.  They are all wonderful and this is about the best among equals. I was born in 1982 and I remember when my parents bought the cassette tape of this album (around 91sh).  It was supposed to be a gift for my grandparents, but my parents thought they would listen to it on the way home from the store.  We were all very surprised and impressed by the ""quality"" of the music that we kept the tape!  The album has been part of our family ever since - each Christmas it's played almost non stop. This CD sounds sooooooo cool.It's Christmas music with a very awesome sound.Love it any time of the year.Go get it...it will life your spirits and soothe your sole at the same time. Mannheim Steamroller continues to take the traditional and make it modern without debasing the music.  This time the title is simple: ""Christmas.""  In this CD enjoy everything from ""Deck the Halls"" to ""Stille Nacht"" with modern instrumentation, but respect for music that is centuries old.  ""We Three Kings"" is one of my all time favorite carols, although it's a mere century-and-a-half old, and this is the finest version I've ever heard.  Adding to the enjoyment are the notes.  For example, of ""The Coventry Carol,"" ""This carol was originally from the mid 1400's, however, the melody as it is in this version is derived from a later version in 1591.""  Some of the instruments used add to the charm of Steamroller, for instance: Black Oak Hammered Dulcimer, soprano Dulcian, camel bells, dry ice, clavichord, and lute. Okay, Finley Harrison, you can count me in as a non-baby boomer who LOVES this music! Maybe I was influenced by my baby boomer parents who played it religiously every year when we decorated for Christmas, but I loved it even as a kid. Most Christmas music is either sleepy or too bouncy-cheesy. This stuff is ENERGIZING! And you have to admit, their ballads really are quite beautiful too. Well, regardless of what anyone else thinks, Manheim Steamroller will always be a tradition in my home (I am now 25 and have 2 children of my own) and so far no one has complained! (well, they're only 1 and 3, but they still have opinions!)Long Live Manheim Steamroller, and I wish everyone an ENERGIZED Christmas! The first of the Mannheim Steamroller Christmas albums, this one is a lot of fun, too. A bit more  traditional than ""A Fresh Aire Christmas"", this album has a lot of arrangements that could be from The Renaissance. Harp, lute, hammered dulcimer, and clavichord  join more contemporary instruments in stylings that are sometimes classical and other times modern. A rollicking ""Deck the Halls"" opens the album. Its fast tempo and heart-thumping bass line let you know right away that this Christmas album isn't going to take itself too seriously! This is definitely a modern arrangement, and it is gregarious to the fullest degree. ""We Three Kings"", ""Bring a Torch, Jeannette Isabella"", and ""Coventry Carol"" sound ancient with mostly acoustic instruments. Next comes a rock and roll ""Good King Wenceslas"" with plenty of voltage powering the instruments! The next four ""olde English""pieces comprise the ""Christmas Sweet"" played in a style and instrumentation befitting that era. The rocking version of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" is possibly my favorite Christmas recording of all time. It is totally infectious and commands me to hit ""replay"" every time it gets near the end. Full of joy and fun, this is what I think Christmas should feel like at least a few times during the season! ""Stille Nacht"" closes out the CD on a soothing and peaceful note. This is a great Christmas album, and I highly recommend it. Chip Davis was a genius to transform the traditional Christmas songs into his own renditions This is on of his classics. Mannheim Steamroller produces some of the most creative Christmas music I've ever found. I love the interplay between ancient, traditional, and synthesized instruments. The music is truly exhilarating when played on a high quality audio system. This album was my introduction to the group. I now own their entire collection. Just love their joyful synth sounds. I am very happy with this product. I has played beautifully and very pleasing to the ears. I can't believe this has not been re-released in HDCD like Fresh Aire 1-8 were. What is the hold up? This one probably sold more than those other cds combined. I enjoyed this album very much. The music is classic and is original in it's own way.I also enjoyed working with this merchant. The item was packaged safely and arrived in perfect condition and was still sealed in plastic as the merchant had indicated. I would definitely recommend both this album and merchant. For me, the terms ""Mannheim Steamroller"" and ""Christmas"" are not at all mutually exclusive--one cannot exist without the other.  When I think of Christmas music, I instantly think of Mannheim, and for good reason...reason which is completely evidenced on this album, the one that started it all for Chip Davis and his series of Christmas celebrations.  For years these compilations have been among my favorite recordings of all time, and I'm proud to say I've grown up with them.  And one thing's for certain: ""Mannheim Steamroller Christmas"", though possibly not even Mannheim's best Christmas album, is an album that nobody should miss.My track-by-track analysis:1. Deck the Halls - Wow.  What an opener.  On the album, the one that started it all, this is the track that started it all, and with good reason.  A completely original take on an old Welsh favorite, this track contains the perfect mixture between modern synthesizer music and old-style Baroque music, with harpsichord, horns, and a full-fledged string section.  This song is a home run, possibly one of the greatest.  And to start out the album this well!2. We Three Kings - Another fantastic arrangement.  The Middle-Eastern feel in the beginning is indescribably fitting to the piece, and obviously to the setting of the story.  And then there is a certain fullness to the chorus that rounds out the arrangement.  Another track you can listen to again and again and never get tired of it.3. Bring A Torch - This is a very simple arrangement in the beginning, with simple harp chords accompanying an alto recorder.  This melts seamlessly into a beautiful oboe solo with a full string section in the background.  As the old adage asserts, less is indeed more.  That's a concept that seems to have been forgotten more recently.4. Coventry Carol - Another simplistic arrangement of an ancient carol I'm not actually familiar with.  The only problem I have with this piece is that it is SO simple and so authentic that it actually loses some of the classic Mannheim appeal, feeling simply like an ancient piece.5. Good King Wenceslas - However, the Mannheim appeal does not go missing for long, it would seem.  This kind of thing is what Chip Davis has become famous for in his Christmas arrangements: taking traditional carols and toying with them.  In this case the rhythm is quite fun, and a new approach on this traditional English carol of the like that hasn't been heard before now.  A very fun track that I'm sure was recorded with much exuberance.  A-well-a good King Wenceslas looked down...6. Wassail, Wassail - This is another one where I'm not quite familiar with the original piece, but I've learned one thing about Mannheim's arrangements: any arrangement that features a kazoo player is going to be good.  He admits to extending the melody into his own new sections...but that's something that often seems to work when he does it.  Overall, it's a bit under standard ... but that bar is very high in terms of Mannheim.7. Carol of the Birds - So I will admit it: ""Christmas Sweet"", the first half at least, I'm not a big fan of.  It's a bit too quiet and simplistic...but then again, this is an older Mannheim album, from back when they were more laid-back.  It's a good piece, just not a great one.8. I Saw Three Ships - This movement of the ""Sweet"", however, I very much like.  There's nothing overly extraordinary about it, but it's a good, solid Baroque Mannheim arrangement.9. God Rest You, Merry Gentlemen - This version of one of my very favorite Christmas carols is quite fun, especially when you see what he did with it.  It features three short 25-second segments at the beginning which all play the melody... and then puts them all together (along with a fourth segment) at the end to create a perfect harmony between the three.  Clever, no?10. God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen - The two arrangements of the same tune are about as different as two arrangements of the same tune can be.  The horns used throughout the piece give this one an almost regal feeling to the piece.  This track is truly incredible, bringing in a perfect blend between the old English carol and, well, full-fledged rock music.  He has also written his own bridge for the piece, which is fantastic as well.  The overall effect is amazing, and makes for one of the downright coolest Mannheim Christmas arrangements of all time.11. Stille Nacht - I've got to hand it to whoever set the order of the tracks--they ordered it so that the standout tracks were the first two and the last two...and saved the best for last.  This arrangement is almost inordinately beautiful.  It starts out simple with a male chorus of ""oohs"", and builds, builds, builds, until it reaches the climax, in which a solo violinist (Steve Shipps, doing a remarkable job) is accompanied by a full orchestra.  This piece is the apex of beauty, and one of the most astonishingly moving closing tracks of all time. I can think of nothing more Christmasy than this group! A lovely change from all the other renditions one hears. This is great to wrap gifts by, or to pick up your spirits as you are decorating the house and trimming the tree. This CD is different from other Christmas music.  It is very upbeat, all music and a great sound.  I am enjoying it for the holidays. I really like Mannheim Steamroller's Chrismas music, so this one completed my collection of albums. I am replacing vinyl / cassettes.  This was on my &#34;must haves&#34; of Chirstmas albums. Glad I bought this download. I first heard this group many years ago. I had the CD but lost it along the way. Now that I have the digital versions of them I can hold onto them for a lot longer. I was introduced to this CD many years ago through a roommate who had it. Unfortunately, when I moved out, I never had the title. I tried it this time, and with delight found that yes, this was the CD that I had loved then and wanted ever since. Mannheim Steamroller has done other Christmas CDs, but I like this best. Perhaps not everyone will; we all have individual tastes. But I love the mix of everything from middle ages and renaissance instrumentation and harmonies on some things, to the mix of that and very modern stuff with everything in between. To me this is one of his best collections of music. I first purchased this cd (well along time ago) my little girl was very small and we enjoyed listening and dancing (her standing of my feet) to the beautiful music. Its kind of a Christmas tradition now and goes on with my children as they have grown and start their own families. Yes this was her Christmas gift. Recorded the year I was born (wow, now don't you feel old?)... I can remember my mom playing this CD every Christmas since I was a young young girl. Now that I'm living on my own,I have my own copy, and busted it out the very first day of Advent. Bing Crosby or Andy Williams can't get me in the mood for Christmas quite like Mannheim Steamroller. Their modern versions of ancient classics can sound dated at times, but just because the instrumentation is from a distinct period in time does not mean it's tacky. I love this album and would recommend it to anybody, including my priest! Christmas is not Christmas without Mannheim Steamroller.  Their version of Silent Night gives me chills every time I hear it.  I had this album on cassette for decades and now on CD.  Whatever comes after CD's, will no doubt be bought also. This CD really puts me in the mood for Christmas.  &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; and &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot; are invigorating synthesizer arrangements that tweak the original compositions just enough  to be delightful.  Coventry Carol is a beautiful example of medieval  English music and Stille Nacht is a PERFECT rendition.  I play it right  before bed every Christmas Eve.  It really evokes the emotion and sentiment  of Christmas for me. This is a replacement for a CD I have lost.Simply wonderfully re-composed Christmas standards in a way only Chip Davis (Mannheim Steamroller) can do:  maintaining the classical structure with elements of jazz and rock improv and full orchestration.  To me, this version of &#34;Good King Wenceslas&#34; is simply stellar!This CD will test the limits of even the sublimely audiophile systems. Many classic xmas favorites, with upbeat twist.A holiday favorite.Have to use filler here since a minimum number of words are required to leave a rating. I have a couple of other Mannheim Steamroller CDs, so I figure I would get this one since many fans say this is their best work. The songs that stand out to me are Deck The Halls, Good King Wenceslas, the upbeat God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and Stille Nacht. If this disc doesn't put you in the holiday mood, nothing will. Get it if you don't have it! Deck the halls opens with album with a synthesizer that gets you into the Christmas spirit.We Three Kings is played with chimes, A dulcimer, a lute and a pan flute.Bring a torch is played on a harp with a recorder.Coventry Carol is played as a duet on classical guitars, very pretty.Wassail, Wassail has violins with a pan flute that sounds like a harpsichord.I Saw Three Ships has a guitar along with a harpsichord and violins.God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen has a violin along with chimes and a classical guitar.Stille Nacht (Silent Night)  is played on a piano.Many of the songs have a Celtic sound. Mannheim Steamroller has made the finest Christmas albums ever released.The arrangements are exquisite. If you are like me and you want to hear many different instruments, you will enjoy this tremendiously.This is for a more sophisticated listener who wants to relax and hear superb musicians perform beautiful Christmas Carols.........Merry Christmas This is the best cd by far to get your Christmas spirit revved.i own all of their music and look forward every Christmas season to listening to it I have had this album for years, but turntable not available anymore. I bought this cd version to continue tradition of playing on Christmas morning while opening gifts. Crisp and clear sound better than original album. Celtic modern sound for those from europe,very moving and upbeat.If you have ever heard trans syberian orchestra, this is who inspired them. The Manheim Steamroller album itself is fantastic!  For me, it all started when a kid on the schoolbus in grade school gave me a cassette tape of several songs from this album.  In college I filled the rest of the worn cassette with fun & crazy Christmas tunes.  It was a favorite!  I wore it out, of course.  I was enjoying my Kindle Fire by the Christmas tree this year when I wanted to hear it.  I purchased the MP3.  Unfortunately, it did not appear in the Amazon Cloud until the next day, and then only via computer.  It finally appeared via the Kindle that afternoon, at least 18 hours after I'd wanted to listen to it. I love the collection of music in this album. Very nicely done. Good listening and a good take on traditional music. Loved the cd.  Our favorite are the Mannheim Steamrollers.  We would reccomend  them to anyone that likes good music and a little lively.Thanks.  Nettie This was a wonderful CD to get us into the Christmas spirit.  Their music, as always is terrific!  We played it over and over again, especially during our quiet reflective times.  My favorite is Silent Night. what a deal1  Great price and great music....cant go wrong.  If you havent enjoyed Mannheim, start soon as they are wonderfuo This is really the best Christmas music ever. Really makes you want Christmas all the time. This is something I have been looking for this for a long time. I am glad to own it now. These recordings will dispel the commercialism of Christmas present. After listening to &quot;Coventry Carol&quot; I wanted to redecorate the house Tudor style and throw out the TV. I'm not one for playing carols over the  holidays but &quot;Christmas&quot; has now become an annual tradition!  Truly gifted musicians are these. This is the classic album and so successful that Mannheim Steamroller has come out with at least a half dozen other Christmas albums, trying to duplicate the success.  They failed.  This one is the all-time classic. This is one of our all time favorite Holiday CDs.  It is nice to mix in with other favorites to change it up a bit and still get the feel of the season. Besides the fact the first Christmas album is just a bit too short, I completely love this album. Not only does it have the ""modern"" Mannheim Steamroller sound, but they did a number of songs in the 16th-17th Century musical style that I really appreciate.Without doubt, the best song on the album is their rendition of ""Stille Nacht."" Amazingly soothing and beautiful, the end of that song (which concludes the album) always leave you teary-eyed. Great cd for getting into the holiday spirit!  I actually bought this for my 17 year old daughter, whose musical tasted range somewhere between Mozart and Jason Aldean :)  She was so sad after losing another Mannheim cd in a car wreck ( yes, it WAS that bad) that I had to look for a replacement.  This is the one I chose.  She has enjoyed it and that is her go to cd if I ask her to put on Christmas music I wanted another Mannheim Steamroller Christmas album. I had this particular album only on cassette. I found this to be a great specimen/ The service of geting the CD was fast, to the extent that I can wait 2 days to get it. The price was right, saved some money, it was new, sealed and received in perfect condition at a time of year when governmentmail service can be damaging.  --Roger W. With a contemporary yet affectionate spin, Chip Davis creates a Christmas album that you will enjoy for the rest of your life.  By including the Renaissance instrumentation in such classics as The Coventry Carol, etc.,  and combining and mixing this authentic approach with the delightful  pop-infused, and deftly arranged, confections such as Deck The Halls, this  album has something, literally, for everyone.  While mostly everyone who  has loved this album since the 80s when it first appeared has spoken in  hushed whispers of joy over Stille Nacht, I have to take offense with the  mingling of sacred and Santa in the final seconds -- otherwise, it is  perfection.  It is Davis' and the Steamroller's ability to  &quot;re-chord&quot; a song's essential structure in new and exciting ways  that I find so intoxicating -- it is literally as if he breathes new life  into the classic songs he has chosen. We've all heard &quot;White Christmas&quot; sung in millions of ways, heard punk versions of &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer&quot; and &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; and heard Bruce Springsteen sing &quot;Santa Claus is Coming to Town.&quot;  All of them are great.  Christmas music is good stuff.  Yet, I think there comes a point when the holiday classics need to sound as beautiful as they can.  Mannheim Steamroller accomplishes this on Christmas 1984, performing some of the most haunting, beautiful melodies I've ever heard.Kicking off with a combination of orchestra and techno, not only is every song on this album beautiful, but they are unique as well.  With an amazing choir, a wind machine, and the most amazing orchestra I have had the pleasure of listening to, this album ends better than it begins, with Stille Nacht, a haunting melody that is a reflective and quiet tribute to the idea behind Christmas.  It's the loveliest version of any Christmas song I have ever heard.This album is unique, and it sounds absolutely wonderful.  Not a day has gone by since the day after Thanksgiving where Christmas 1984 has not been in my CD player.  This CD will be an investment worth your time.  Give yourself a little gift this holiday season and pick up Christmas 1984.  It won't leave your CD player until next Christmas. I ordered this from Amazon and got the LP still in the plastic from 1984!  I've already played it several hundred times.  It's one of the best Christmas albums ever.  Even more fun to have the original LP. Mannheim Steamroller is a great Christmas CD.  The music is excellent and stirring while yet relaxing.  This is a great CD for traditional Christmas music. What a wonderful, imaginative, exhilarating  arrangement of  traditional Christmas music!. As a musician, I've composed Christmas carols, and specially enjoy the Christmas season. This recording adds much to the festive spirit of Christmas in my home and it's the first CD I put on when it's time to play Christmas music. This is Mannheim Steamroller's first--and best--Christmas album.  If I had to pick an all-time favorite Christmas album, this would be it.  My favorite cut is the rocked-out version of &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen,&quot; which will compel the listener to jump to their feet and start dancing.  That cut is followed by a haunting version of &quot;Silent Night,&quot; which will bring back childhood memories of soft Christmas lights twinkling in a darkened living room...at least, it always does for me. This CD was not what I expected. It is a descent CD but not as great as I hoped it would be. I love Christmas music and Manheim Steamroller has always been my fave to listen to at Christmas time. My fave song on this whole album is Silent Nacht which of course is Silent Night. It's beautiful. The 2 versions of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen are by far the best I've heard ever. Before you run off yelling, &quot;not more new interpretations of classic Christmas songs&quot;, lend Chip Davis your ear! &quot;Deck The Halls&quot;, &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen(modern version)&quot;, and especially &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; are toe-tapping hits! The older-sounding ones, especially &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen(Renaissance version), are excellent! And, if I should have to pick a Mannheim Steamroller Christmas favorite(from all three of their Christmas albums), it's &quot;Stille Nacht&quot; hands down. Enjoy!P.S. For a kind of a Christmassy album, just dealing with themes of winter, try Mannheim Steamroller's &quot;Fresh Aire 4&quot;. Yup! There was snow and it arrived too late to give as a gift to someone special. There is not much variation in the Steamroller Christmas albums, but one always hopes for another unexpected arrangement to match the excitement of hearing this group for the first time. This cliche elevator muzak was trite at its 1990 release. Go for Elvis or Liberace Christmas music. There's another reason why Christmas music is only played everywhere during December, I mean November. This music is cheese, it is saccharine, it is just as bad as Siberian Orchestra! Without exaggerating, this may be (for better or worse) the most musically important Christmas album ever released.  By blending reverent, neo-classical interpretations with (now semi-) modern synthesizers and percussion, Chip Davis virtually re-defined contemporary Christmas music.  While the more contemporary/electronic arrangements can occassionally sound cheesy, and while the contrast with the ultra-traditional interpretations can occassionally be jarring, the result is undeniably unique.  And, for anyone who grew up in the 1980s, even the most questionable Chip Davis efforts will for ever after evoke powerful holiday nostalgia.And few Chip Davis efforts are really &quot;questionable.&quot;  In general, the arrangements on this disc are masterful.  &quot;Bring a Torch...&quot; and &quot;Silent Night,&quot; in particular, are hauntingly beautiful.  And, while the electronics may not be for everyone, they are tastefully done, they do evoke a festive mood, and they keep the album from sounding like every other orchestral Christmas album you've ever heard.If you are one of the 17 Americans who hasn't heard this music, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.  It is, quite simply, essential Christmas music. With four albums in the Mannheim Steamroller catalog now, I still keep returning to their first:  1984's &quot;Christmas.&quot;  It opens with the majestic &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; and closes with the ethereal treatment of &quot;Silent Night.&quot;  While the group's Fresh Aire series could at times be a bit bombastic and over the top, producer/arranger/director Chip Davis keeps himself in check and in so doing has created a contemporary Christmas masterpiece for the ages.  There's a gaping whole in your Christmas record library if you don't already own this one.  ESSENTIAL I love the Manheim Steamroller and this CD.  It truly captures the spirit of Christmas. Manheim Steamroller only produces the very best music. This was a christmas present for my family & it has become a part of our tradition while decorating the house. Again product delivered on time and undamaged. Great price. I have this on tape cassette thought is was time to update to CD. Was sold out at alot of other places. Would recommend to others. Mannheim Steamroller... easy on the ears and inspires listening to again and again.  Long stressful day at work?  Here's a simple remedy:  Make a hot beverage; grab a cozy blanket; place your CD in the player; settle into your favourite chair, cover with blanket, enjoy your hot beverage and let the music surround you and feel your stress leave.  From the clear notes of Brass horns to the tear-inducing notes of violins... Mannheim Steamroller lifts the spirit and transports the listener, musically, to another place.I love the music and have most of the CD's from this group.  When it approaches Thanksgiving, I always look forward to December and Christmas because the season heralds a new CD release from Mannheim Steamroller. Above all, the whole recording is awsome!  I tip my hat to Chip Davis.  Though i have heard the original recording for years on a 33Lp,  the cd brought back the memories of Christmas past to my head.When i play the cd in the kitchen while making cut out cookies, i have to play this cd.  At that point, time seems to not exist. I am taken back to the old house whare i grew up, and i can still see my mother in her usual holiday atire, hunchered over the stove and semmelling the great aroma of the christmas rolls. On christmas mornings, we would go down as a family and eat breakfast. And in the backround would be this 33Lp playing.I hope that my childern will have the same experience that i had and i hope they have these great christmas memories also.  Thanks Chip! Out of the 11 tracks - you will have to decide for yourself if the purchase is worth the one great track - # 13 - Stille Nacht.  Most all of the other tracks sounds like a Grade 9 student's 1980 synthesizer project. Yuck. I suggest passing by this one, yet try to find this (Track 11) ""Stille Nacht"" elsewhere by alternate means... Very interesting interpretations of traditional Christmas fare. Bright and lively. I'm only reiterating what others have said, but I'd like to re-emphasize how amazing this album is. I have seen Chip Davis in concert for a Christmas show, and it just blew me away. There is such an incredible amount of talent in the six people that play the instruments to re-create the sounds of holiday classics. If you're a traditionalist, and like Christmas songs as they are, this album wouldn't be for you. But if you like jazzed up songs that infuse emotion and energy with every beat, you will have this CD in your collection forever!

245,477,B0000005MY,"I agree with the reviewer from FL.  This CD was boaring!  It was not the fun, high energy keyboard and brass that I thought it would be.  Most of the songs have solo flute and strings. So far the best X-Mas CD's I've heard are:Joy To The World by John Williams and the Boston PopsB.B. King Christmas CollectionBurl Ives RudolphSo if you want something to help you sleep, I would say get this.  Otherwise, try some other CD's. Anyone will feel christmas when experiancing this album. Great variety of music. Classic to contemporary.love the sounds! You will enjoy. Love this album....Have the cd and loaded on all my devices. Gets me in the christmas mood. Great to bake and sing with!!!!. Wouldn't be Christmas without it!!! Sets the mood for decorating and celebrating. Anyone would enjoy having this in their home. No matter what you choose fro this artist it is fantastic.  Mannheim Steamroller always has great Christmas arrangements, happy to add another one to my collection. I have most of Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas CD's.  This is one of the best and I never get tired of them.  I bought this one to replace the one I had that no longer played. One of the most difficult things imaginable is coming up with Christmas music which is, even in the slightest way, unique.  We've all heard Nat King Cole's gorgeous, silken voice on the old standards, and, Lord Help Us,  how many of Bing's croonings can you take?  Over the years, Mannheim  Steamroller has produced three fine albums, mixing up the standards (some  in synthesized and modernized form) with other ancient pieces that had long  ago fallen off the play list.  This latest studio Christmas album could  well be the best of the group.Many have criticized it as being too  formulaic, or simply as being too like the previous efforts.  Maybe so.  The others are awfully good as well.  You know, I hate to break this to the  critics but since Bach's Christmas Oratorio and Correlli's concertos in the  18th century, and Mendelsohn and Tchaikovsky in the 19th, there hasn't been  a whole lot of good ground-breaking Christmas music written.  If you're  looking for new thing, Christmas isn't exactly the best place to  start.That said, this particular CD is chock-full of wonderful Christmas  melodies, some of which you probably haven't heard before, produced and  presented to meet Manneheim Steamroller's extremely high standards.  Standout tracks include: Mendelsohn's &quot;Joy To The World&quot; -- in a  version as rambunctuous as anything you could get from Arthur Fiedler;  &quot;Pat A Pan&quot; -- a wonderfully simple melody, like fudge it is  Christmas perfection. You will wonder why it isn't more famous than it is;  &quot;Gagliarda&quot;, with it's evocations of a medieval feast in the long  room of a great castle; and &quot;Los Peces El Rio&quot;, Spanish mystery  and flair, rarely heard far north of Mexico.This one will stay in your  Christmas CD rotation as long as you live.  Maybe, being the third such  Christmas CD from the group, it isn't a completely unique or new  experience.  I have yet to have someone show me anyone else that is  producing great Christmas music which incorporates new sounds while  retaining tradition, which is the very nature of the holiday. Well. . . it's been five years now since Manheim Steamroller released their last proper Christmas album. And I can't help but feel that the album was certainly decent for what it was, and it was somewhat of a joy to hear fresh Manheim on the stereo that year, but the impression I get from the record was that it was purely made for commercial reasons, not artistic ones. The first Christmas album practically revolutionized the genre, the second one took it to new heights (and very quickly became my all-time favorite Christmas album). But after seven years, these guys have changed. It seems they've grown a little too successful, their ambitions have changed somewhat. &quot;Gagliarda&quot; and &quot;Pat A Pan&quot; are the best tunes on the album (the latter the only thing close to the classics on the first two), but much of it is lukewarm, reheated material from the first two albums, and really not worth listening to, in my humble opinion. Worst of them all is a tie between &quot;Rudolph&quot; and &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;-- really, really missed the mark on that one. I await their next truly new compilation with some skepticism. Who can not like a Manheim Steamroller Chrismas CD? Classic songs with great Chip Davis arrangements. Stack five of them in the CD changer and have fun. Well to start I can't possibly beat what the music fan from St. Louis said, this is a great CD, possibly Mannheim Steamrollers best Christmas CD. You can't go wrong with any of their Chrismas CDs. What is well said by the earlier fan is that it is unique. So much Christmas music has been pumped out that it starts to run together after you hear it enough. Don't get me wrong I'll always love hearing Nat King Cole croon about &quot;chestnuts roasting on an open fire...&quot;. I started listening to Mannheim Steamroller in 1982 when I heard Fresh Aire III played in a music store. I have been a fan since. When they started releasing Christmas albums I recommended them to all my friends and family because they had appeal for anyone of any age group. If you don't have any of their Christmas CDs try this one for sure. And if you don't have this Mannheim CD, get it! Now, having almost all of the Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CD's, I am extremely glad that I added this one to my collection.  The innovativeness in the carols and Christmas songs make this CD truly remarkable. It provides a musical version of familiar songs that will warm up those Christmas memories and set the mood for a wonderful season. There is not a bad son- 'Scuse me: there is not a MEDIOCORE song on this album. All of them are GREAT &amp; are sure to bring out Christmas spirit wherever you play it.My personal favs are &quot;Rudolph,&quot; &quot;Pat-a-Pan,&quot; ...&amp; the &quot;King Glochkindeifer&quot; one is pretty cool, too. But, as I said, all of them are great.This CD isn't really a Christmas &quot;lullaby.&quot; (Kenny G's &quot;Miracles&quot; is...) Manheim Steamroller is just too lively for that.I strongly encourage you to get this CD today! I definitely recommend this CD to anybody who wants to hear traditional Christmas songs with a twist. The first two Mannheim Steamroller Christmas albums were absolute classics.  Sadly, Christmas in the Aire is just a feeble attempt to generate some more sales by cashing in on Mannheim's previous fame. Save your money and stay away from this album. This CD isn't as good as the other two I have.  It's not necessarily bad, as it's still better than almost any of the other Christmas music CDs I've heard, but there's just not a whole lot that is memorable on this one.  Perhaps it's because I'm not as familiar with the carols as I was with the others.  However, of the ones I am familiar with, none of them have the spark that the other two CDs had.  For years and years, I've been able to hum my favourite tracks off of the other two, even in the middle of July when it's been 6 months since I've listened to them.  This one, however, doesn't have anything like that.That being said, there are a couple of tunes on this one to pay attention to.  The rendition of O Little Town of Bethlehem is outstanding, while the Christmas Lullaby is very nice as well. Both of them are quite beautiful.Unfortunately, the rest of the CD is passable, but not good.  If you are a Mannheim Steamroller fan, I think I would stop after the first two (though perhaps they have returned to form, as I haven't heard any of the other ones after this one). What in the world was MS thinking when they did that sloooow version of Jingle Bells?  It's &quot;Jingle Bells on Valium&quot;.  However the rest of the tracks are good listening, so I do recommend this Mannheim Steamroller knows how to set a pair of ears perfectly at ease.  Much like ""the Blue Album,"" CHRISTMAS IN THE AIRE features many of the lesser known carols, whose tunes many of us readily recognize, but we are oblivious to their titles.  Among these are ""Joseph Dear, Oh Joseph Mine,"" ""Pat-a-Pan,"" ""Gagliarda,"" and ""Los Peces En El Rio"".A German version of ""O Come All Ye Faithful, ""Herbei, Oh Ihr Gl&auml;ubigen,"" is sung beautifully by a children's choir.  This album also boasts a gently flowing ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"" as well as a rendition of ""Jingle Bells"" unlike any version ever recorded.The one track which I had never heard before, but was stunningly beautiful nonetheless was ""Kling Gl&ouml;ckchen"" (also delivered by a children's choir).This along with FRESH AIRE CHRISTMAS (the blue album) and CHRISTMAS EXTRAORDINAIRE (the red album) are my three favorites of Mannheim Steamroller.  They are also some of the best Christmas music I've ever heard and the first things I pull out when it's time to start playing Christmas music each year (and it's earlier for me than most people). This music CD does not disappoint. Really refreshing in the xmas aura of music! Good cover on the CD as well! I seem to write pretty good reviews if I talk about the album track-by-track so here goes:1. Joy to the World: One of the most upbeat adaptations of this great song! This version will lift your spirits and warm your soul.2. Joseph Dear Oh Joseph Mine: A relaxing track with a great flute solo.3. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: Not perfect, but it's pretty good rendition and kids will like it.4. Herbei, oh ihr Glaubigen (O Come All Ye Faithful): Beautiful melodious version which includes the superb Bielefelder Kinderchor of Germany. Definitley one of the reasons to buy this CD.5. Pat A Pan: Another flute passage, the longest track, and generally pretty good.6. O' Little Town of Bethlehem: Nice version of the traditional song. Perfect for getting little ones to sleep (that's a compliment).7. Angels We Have Heard On High: The best track on the album, with its upbeat trumpet passages and wonderful harmonies, this will get anyone in the Christmas mood!8. Gagliarda: Relaxing flute track makes you think of Christmas in foreign lands many years ago. Worth listening to.9. Los Peces en el Rio: Nice Spanish guitar intro that leads into a haunting melody that makes this song another highlight on the album.10. Christmas Lullaby: One listen and you'll swear that this song is a traditional Christmas song. Wrong. Mannheim Steamroller creator Chip Davis wrote it.11. Kling, Glockchen: Shortest track on the album, but just as good as &quot;Herbei, oh ihr Glaubigen&quot; because, once again, a children's choir takes part in it.12. Jingle Bells: Expecting another upbeat song? Think again. This version takes the traditional song and really sloooows it down. Still very good!In short, Mannheim Steamroller's &quot;Christmas in the Aire&quot; is for anyone who's a fan of Chip Davis's music, anyone that liked &quot;Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas&quot;, or anyone that enjoys some relaxing tunes at Christmastime. every album is choice crisp music that will fill the home at Christmas time. way better than church music more up lifting I read one review that said 2 stars... I'm assuming they were &#34;under the influence&#34; when they wrote that. Everyone is entitled to their opinion though, no matter how cruddy. I LOVE this album. As a musician and someone who knows a little bit about sound engineering, it a treasure I enjoy every Christmas and sometimes a little into January! = ) I have all of Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas Cd's, and this one is my favorite....although it was hard for me to determine my favorite since all of their Christmas Music is great listening. Their sound is wonderfully unique, and is sure to become a favorite in your Christmas Collection as well. I like this cd very much! It always puts me in a good mood at this time of the year. I great disc I found a few years ago. Lent it to a friend and I didn't have the heart to ask for it back.I would highly recommend this for the holiday season love amazon.com...I have several CD'S on Mannheim Steamroller...wanted to get some to giveto my kid's for Christmas to hear... kathyan While I like the music, I can't help but feel that Chip Davis might have gone to the well once to often. Chip has yet to re-create the mood, and feel of Stille Nacht from their first release. What made Mannheim special  was their fresh approach to the classics. Now,alas it seems they have run  out of material. After their first two releases, everything began to blend  together. Where has all the creativity gone? Another reviewer hits the nail on the head when he says some people think Mannheim's approach has become too &quot;formulaic.&quot; I'm one of them. What was once new and interesting has now become a by the numbers production, saved by the obscurity of some of the tunes (&quot;Pat a Pan&quot; &quot;Gagliarda&quot;) where the listener can form no preconceptions of how the songs will come out of the Chip Davis &quot;Mixmaster.&quot; Still enjoyable fluff but the newness has worn off. This is a classic Mannheim Steamroller Christmas music CD. Has a good variety of songs and musical pieces. Joy to the World is very inspiring with an implication of singing angels. Same as always.  These guys are top musicians.  You'd think they'd invest more time in getting more creative.  Oh it's good music but I sense because of Rush Limbaugh their sales went up and they thought hey &quot;Let's do  another that sounds exactly the same&quot;. That they did.  This sound  would of passed in the mid 80's but did they realize we're in 1999?.  Hey  Mannheim &quot;There are news sounds out&quot;.  Nice try but I think they  could have done better.  It's dissappointing to hear such awesome musicians  try to duplicate old sounds for new bucks. Was it talking heads who said  &quot;same as it ever was, same as it ever was&quot;? Try again.  I know  you guys got it in you. In my opinion, this album is worth it for just two songs: &quot;Joseph Dear Oh Joseph Mine&quot; and &quot;Jingle Bells.&quot;  Not that the other songs are low quality, by any means.  &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; doesn't even sound like itself; Mannheim Steamroller took this bouncy little tune and transformed it into something very dramatic and emotional.  This is my personal favorite among the Steamroller Christmas albums. Lovely christmas music, glad to add this to my collection. You won't be sorry if you buy this, it is very good. We enjoy listening to Mannheim Steamroller music throughout the year, not just at Christmas. This is a CD you can keep out and just having it playing as you do things around the house. I can't be without my Mannheim Steamroller albums, and this one is no exception. Their music is unique and uplifting and wonderful to listen to! As a Mannheim Steamroller fan for years... this past Christmas I got to see a long-held, but silent, dream of mine come true.  I got to see Brian Boitano and Ekaterina Gordeeva skate to some of their music.  Whenever I listen to this CD, or any of the Mannheim Steamroller Christmas cd's, I visualize the skaters, their routines, and what selections they would choose to skate to.A few of my favourite selections from this album are:  Pat-a-Pan (a lovely piece), Christmas Lullaby (which was written for the child of one of the group members), and Angels We Have Heard on High.  I don't just listen to these cd's at Christmas, I listen to them when I'm writing or doing my homework because the music is soothing and while being easy on the ears, it allows me to focus on my work.Thank You Chip and group members for a lovely cd.  I always look forward to Hastings putting out the selections of Christmas music because it usually means a new Mannheim Steamroller cd is out.Whether you are a Mannheim Steamroller fan, or one who's new to the group and its music, this cd is a ""must have"".  You'll be thoroughly captivated. I was really looking forward to the third in a series of Christmas albums from Mannheim Steamroller, and have to say that I was at least as disappointed in ""Christmas In the Aire"" as I was in seeing Mannheim in ""concert"" (the Milli Vanilli of instrumental music!!!). With a few exceptions, most of these songs sound like the group was trying too hard to top the previous two albums and instead turned out a mostly ho-hum CD. ""Joy to the World"" is wonderful and full of exuberance. ""Rudolph"" is almost impossible to listen to all the way through - totally obnoxious to my ears. ""Pat A Pan"" is inventive, fresh, and very infectious - this was the kind of creativity I was hoping for in more of the album. ""O Come, All Ye Faithful"" and ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"" are pretty standard stuff. ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" is full of percussion and rhythm - again close to the mark. ""Gagliarda"" is classic Mannheim and their Renaissance Ensemble Le Doo Dah Band.""Los Pesces en el Rio"" is a less well-known holiday piece that mixes soothing wordless vocals with a rock beat in the middle  - catchy! ""Christmas Lullaby"" is a Chip Davis original that is the best thing about this mixed bag of an album. Sublimely sweet and sentimental without any gag factor, this song is a winner! The closing track is a downright depressing rendition of ""Jingle Bells"". The piece is lovely, but there is no ""laughing all the way"" or ""oh what fun"". It's interesting, but I really don't see the point. This cd is really freaking good. If you like Mannheim Steamroller, well, this is more of it. It's one of my favorites. The holiday albums of Mannheim Steamroller continue to impress, with ""Christmas in the Aire"" from 1995 being their third holiday album up to that point in time.The track ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" is quite simply one of the most perfect Mannheim songs you will ever hear, next to the all time classic and radio standard Deck the Halls from the 1984 debut album.  This one is a must for any Christmas fans playlist.  Joy to the World is another strong track on this record.  Los Peces En El Rio is now a Holiday standard for me.  What a song.I would say that I enjoy ""Christmas in the Aire"" slightly more than the second Steamroller Christmas from 1988.  The keyboards are in perfect form, the percussion is great as always, and the overall production is smooth and crisp.If you enjoy this one, then you are in for a treat with ""Christmas Song"" from 2007. As usual, this Manheim album is a real keeper and one to enjoy and play at the holidays year after year. I bought this cd because I love Manheim Steamroller's music in fact I've loved from the very first time I heard it for its so uplifting........ Really need to start listening to the MP3s first. This may be a best selling album but it is awful in my opinion. There are so many better choices out there This item and that of the Mannheim Steamroller: Christmas Song made for a wonderful Christmas present to a big fan of theirs! I bought this CD for a relatively low price at a music store. I have the Live and Christmas Angel albums, so this was the first actual studio CD of theirs that I bought. I had heard Joy to the World and Angels We Have Heard on High before. Other tracks I like on this CD are Pat a Pan, Rudolph the Reindeer and Jingle Bells. I came into the Mannheim Steamroller fan appreciation late in the game. But I must say, they do a great job of interpreting Christmas songs and putting their own spin on them. This is the third of four superb Christmas albums.Mannheim has a reputation of synthesizers, and exquisite arrangements of Christmas music, second to none.Joy to the World opens with a synthesizer.Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer has a synthesizer and a drum machine.Pat-A-Pan is played on a pan flute and has a Celtic sound to it.O Little town of Bethlehem is slowed down and is played with bells, it is very relaxing.Angels we have heard on High is very nicely done as well.It is performed by an Orchestra with an added synthesizer.Christmas lullaby is played on a flute with bells and a harpsichord, another outstanding arrangement  with a renaisance sound to it.Jingle Bells is actually played with bells.As with the other three albums the songs are very well arranged.The moond and the tone the music sets, not only gets you into the Christmas spirit, but is very relaxing as well.No collection is complete without Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Music - what else is like it? And this orchestra does it best. The first time I heard this album was over a store's PA system. It was the first time I had HEARD of Mannheim Steamroller. I fell in love with the music, and had to have the album.  I bought it that same day!!!  Now I have 3 of the Christmas albums, and intend to purchase some of their other albums as well.  I think they are GREAT!! This was a very enjoyable disc to listen to while driving around during the holidays.  Long holiday trips are the best with the Steamroller I got this when it first came out many, many years ago, but lost the CD. My husband downloaded it for me and I love it! I must have lent, or gave away, my original copy of Christmas in the Aire; how happy I was to be able to obtain another copy to replace it.  Keep up the good work, Mannheim Steamroller!  You make my holiday complete. We had a Mannheim Steamroller Christmas this year ... we loved it.  This was one of 4 that I downloaded the MP3's on Christmas eve.  We played them all day Christmas day -- even the young people and babies enjoyed it. Christmas songs hardly get any better than the interpretation by Mannheim Steamroller! Why are more words required to make a review? Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said? &quot;Joy To The World&quot;, and &quot;Los Peces En El Rio&quot; just makes me want to bust a move! I love all of Mannheim Steamroller's music, e.g. the Fresh Aire 1-7(and now 8) series, Chip Davis'(main composer) solo album &quot;Impressions&quot;, and even the Chip Davis Day Parts series. This CD is one of the best by Mannheim. It has the ingredients of an above average Christmas album finely orchestrated. Try cut # 12 (Jingle Bells) late at night on X-mas eve, on your stereo. It  will bring back memories of your earliest Christmas joys. Enjoy!!!! After the revolutionary &quot;Christmas&quot; and the glorious &quot;Fresh Aire Christmas,&quot; it may have been almost impossible for the third Mannheim Steamroller Christmas album to live up to listeners' expectations.  At any rate, &quot;Christmas in the Aire&quot; doesn't.The problem with &quot;Christmas in the Aire&quot; is not performance (although &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; is disappointing), but an appallingly weak song selection.  Perhaps Chip ran out of truly beautiful Christmas classics to interpret, but he certainly could have found better material than relative unknowns like &quot;Pat-a-Pan&quot; and &quot;Gagliarda,&quot; not to mention tired holiday drivel like &quot;Rudolph&quot; and &quot;Jingle Bells.&quot;Chip's original composition, &quot;Christmas Lullaby,&quot; is quite beautiful, but unfortunately it's buried near the end of a rather tedious CD. Just because one has the name doesn't mean one willbe happy with another Christmas CD.  Folks, spend iton his other CD's, but preview it first! Excellent Christmas music CD!  Saw them in concert (third time) over Thanksgiving weekend 2013 in Albuquerque and realized I did not have several songs - they were from this CD that I gave up in a divorce. So now I am very happy! Having all of the Mannheim series (including a pre-Mannheim C.W. McCall tape) I found this Christmas CD to be the best collection to date.The 'Los Peces en el Rio' selection is especially evocative. It brings to the  mind's eye a little Mexican town slumbering on a chilly Christmas eve under  a bright starry sky with a luminaria filled town square.Mannheim's soft  choral opening is accompanied by a solitary church bell which is enhanced  when their characteristic bass line joins in.The song finishes by returning  to the soft chorus and plaintive tolling of the bell. A must hear!!Being  a fan of the Southwestern culture, I think this selection should be a  standard in that area.The two German carols are also very good. A  German-American friend had tears in her eyes when she first heard them and  remarked that they recalled her childhood Christmases in Germany.Bravo,  Mister Davis!","Noels,Adult Alternative,Progressive,Pop,Holiday & Wedding,New Age,Opera & Classical Vocal,Rock,Vocal Non-Opera,Electronic,Christmas",agree reviewer fl cd boaring fun high energy keyboard brass thought would solo flute strings far best x mas cds ive heard joy world john williams boston popsb b king christmas collectionburl ives rudolphso want something help sleep would say get otherwise try cds anyone feel christmas experiancing great variety classic contemporary love sounds enjoy love cd loaded devices gets christmas mood great bake sing wouldnt christmas without sets mood decorating celebrating anyone would enjoy home matter choose fro artist fantastic mannheim steamroller always great christmas arrangements happy add another one collection mannheim steamrollers christmas cds agree reviewer fl cd fun high high energy energy keyboard brass thought solo flute strings far best heard joy world john boston king want help sleep say try cds feel great variety classic contemporary love sounds enjoy love cd loaded devices christmas mood great sing christmas sets mood decorating celebrating enjoy home matter choose fro artist fantastic mannheim steamroller steamroller great arrangements happy add collection mannheim steamrollers steamrollers christmas cds
246,478,B0000005N2,"This live performance makes youfeel you are there.  It's great music.  I bought this album for my daughter.  She likes mine so much that I had to buy another. Product was as described and was shipped promptly.  Would definitely order from this seller again and again! We were able to keep the music going when we received it and will look forward to bringing it out early each Christmas. I have to agree with a couple of other reviewers that these songs sound almost the same as the studio recordings, but with the added audience sounds. It does have different songs from The Christmas Angel. I bought this CD after that one. Carol of the Bells and Angels We Have Heard on High is on here, but so is God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen. I fell in love with this version of the song upon first hearing it. There's something for everyone on here. This is a good CD for those who want to get a sampling of Mannheim Steamroller's music. This album contains live recordings of songs from all their Christmas albums so far.  I picked this up a couple of days ago, and cannot get it out of my head (or my CD player) yet!  As an added bonus, it has sounds  that they use live for some of the tracks (explosions in Pat a Pan) which  are not on the studio recordings.  If you have no other Steamroller  Christmas albums, get this one.  If you have them all, get this one anyway-  it makes a nice addition to the others. It is very enjoyable and it puts me in a good mood and I enjoy eating my meals listening to it. Not more than half, not nearly all, but all. These are decent renditions of material from The Roller's first two Christmas releases, they stand as proof that Chip & Co can do their stuff live, but the finale ""Going To Another Place"" isn't a holiday number, it's the finale from the ""Fresh Aire II"" release. Granted, it makes a good, bouncy sendoff from a live show after their pensive arrangement of ""Silent Night"", but its very existence proves that these guys could have come up with an upbeat prog lite instrumental that isn't a remake of a traditional Christmas song (e.g. ""Deck the Halls""). If they were too late to get it on the third ""Christmas In the Aire"", they could have made it exclusive to this release. We are long time Steamroller fans, so it is easy to rate this so just one word says it all.....AWESOME! If you do not already own a Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CD, this is a fair compilation of music released on Mannheim's previous recordings of Christmas music.  However,  the tracks sound virtually the same as their  earlier Christmas CD's, the only difference being the inclusion of audience  applause.  My recommendation is to purchase any of the previously released  Christmas CD's by Mannheim Steamroller for a more satisfying listening  experience. This was my first experience with this group which I bought in a used bargin bin.Frankly I was expecting some kind of cliched interpretation of xmas songs - the kind ussually advertised on TV during November to  December and played in stores - meaning it would only be good to be played  once a year at Christmas day.What a surprise! On most of these songs;  you can only barely tell that it is xmas songs being played with light  touches of electronica with a strong emphasis of flutes, panpipes,  recorders and other medieval instrumemtation thrown into the mix; thus  sound very non seasonal therefore making it Christmas music you could play  all year roundIt could be said that this is the type of Christmas music  a progressive rock band like Jethro Tull, Happy the Man, Camel etc would  make.Thus a more delightful suprise given that I thought it would sound  something more ambientlike Yanni.Given this, yours truly will checkout  more of Steamroller's recordings and welcomes any suggestions of  Steamroller recordings exhibiting their more progressive side.For a  Christmas recording that is non cliched and has the ability to be played  all year round; it gets a 10/10 It's a crying shame that Mannheim Steamroller's live Christmas album wasn't released in the early 1990s (i.e. between the 2nd and 3rd studio releases), instead of 1997.  One only has to skim the track listing to see why.  The album is loaded with relatively weak efforts from &quot;Christmas in the Aire&quot; (&quot;Pat-a-Pan,&quot; &quot;Rudolph,&quot; &quot;Gagliarda,&quot; etc.) while Chip's masterpiece &quot;Fresh Aire Christmas&quot; is almost totally unrepresented.  Someone was asleep at the switch on this one.","Noels,Adult Alternative,Vocal Pop,Progressive,Pop,Holiday & Wedding,New Age,Opera & Classical Vocal,Rock,Vocal Non-Opera,Electronic,Christmas",live performance makes youfeel great bought daughter likes mine much buy another product described shipped promptly would definitely order seller able keep going received look forward bringing early christmas agree couple reviewers sound almost studio recordings added audience sounds different christmas angel bought cd one carol bells angels heard high god rest ye merry gentlemen fell love version upon first hearing theres something everyone good cd want get sampling mannheim steamrollers contains live recordings christmas far picked live live performance performance great bought daughter likes buy product described shipped promptly definitely order seller able keep keep going received look forward bringing early christmas agree couple reviewers sound studio studio recordings recordings added audience sounds different christmas angel bought cd carol bells angels heard high god god rest ye god rest ye merry gentlemen rest merry gentlemen fell love version hearing good cd want sampling mannheim steamrollers steamrollers contains live recordings far picked
247,479,B0000005N7,"Only one song (Return to the Earth) sounds like classic Mannheim Steamroller. Otherwise its just good classical music - probably worth the $6.95 I paid. How can you not like the Mannheim Steamroller group?  Another good one by this group.  Buy it and enjoy them. I have listened to this C.D. many times before. I really liked most of it. I really liked the first 2 songs on it, Like &quot;The Pines Of Rome: I Pini Di Villa Borghese&quot; (On Track 1), and &quot;The Pines Of Rome: III Pini Del Gianicolo&quot; (On Track 2), and I also liked the song called &quot;Grand Canyon Suite: CloudBurst&quot;. Several Minutes of that song sounding a little scary though, like you were having a big nightmare about &quot;Yellowstone&quot;, that it was all getting destroyed by a bad, terrible storm, and was coming to an end. But it still had great instroments playing for it, and some of it sounded beautiful, like making up for the beauty of the area around the Yellowstone Grand Canyon. I very much too liked it having a lot of the great songs from some of the &quot;Fresh Aire&quot; Albums. They all sounded like big outside Nature. The first 2 songs on the C.D. (which are the two &quot;Pines Of Rome&quot; songs produced by an early 1900's Italian Musician named Ottorino Respighi) reminded me of being there at Yellowstone watching the birds and other things flying by in the beautiful sky and past the trees, and me exploring the region. The first &quot;Pines Of Rome&quot; song reminded me of seeing lots of pretty white snow covering the beautiful big and small pine trees in the mountains of Yellowstone, and looking down from higher elevations at beautiful frozen lakes over a beautiful sunset, and viewing at more far views of snow covered mountains. The second &quot;Pines Of Rome&quot; song reminded me of looking down at different great far views, and seeing lots of different great Nature there. It reminded me of slowly walking down a hill or mountain into the woods on the grounds of Yellowstone, and looking at a bunch of lakes and slow moving waterfalls, and watching water animals that live in them swimming around. Plus, it reminds me of watching all kinds of beautiful birds flying by, and looking at stuff turning color there in the changing season of Autumn. I really loved all of the Music. It reminds me of really going into that National Park, and exploring it, and having the time of my life doing it. More beautiful music from Mannheim Steamroller, who did this cd as a benefit to Yellowstone after the fire up there. Terrible the only sound that was good was the machine turning off. If it was free it would have costto much Having recently visited the Yellowstone National Park area, it was nice to listen to this music meant for the theme of Yellowstone. I'm a big fan of Mannheim Steamroller's music, though I've only heard their Christmas albums, and when my brother bought this album, I sat down to listen to it, and here are my thoughts.Track 1 (2:58): Glistening bells and trumpets resound to welcome you to the CD; the music is very light, happy, and upbeat. Somehow, the orchestra tunes remind me of the Disney Peter Pan cartoon; the style is similar somehow.Track 2 (7:16): Very calm, easy-listening and classical sounding; mostly instrumental.Track 3 (2:26): Calm and classical like track 2, but with sounds of nature in the background.Track 4 (7:29): Another calm, classical tune, like unto tracks 2 and 3. What is Mannheim shooting for, NPR status?Track 5 (3:44): Opens with the quiet sounds of a horse, who majestically gallops away and whinnies. Music itself sounds western, or perhaps a Middle-Eastern flair; they make use of my favorite instrument in this tune: the choir! The song is very majestic and enjoyable.Track 6 (4:51): Starts with noises of the ocean, and the sounds of a piano and flute. These quickly swell into a much grander tune, but the song still maintains the simple strains of the flute.Track 7 (2:46): Short, mild and simple. Mostly strings and horns. It kind of reminded me of the Mannheim Christmas track ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"". (Since the Christmas albums are the only ones I've heard until now, that's, I'm afraid, my standard of comparison for the other music)Track 8 (3:11): Very quiet; primarily piano, with outdoor noises. Very much like a lullaby, actually.Track 9 (3:48): Hey, stolen! This is the well-known Allegro by Antonio Vivaldi, and I have no idea what it's doing on this disc!Track 10 (4:57): Part II of Allegro.Track 11 (5:28) Lullaby-like, but much more beautiful than track 8. MUCH more beautiful. This probably gets the ""Dave's Favorite"" award of the CD.Track 12 (5:02): The name ""Digital Dulcimer"" came to mind when I heard this. You'll have to listen to see for yourself why. There are night sounds in the beginning, and it pretties up around the time 2:20.Track 13 (9:29): Opening sounds remind one of a bright morning on the prairie, but soon charges into regal symphonic sounds. Following this, in the spirit of the Storm Sequence of the William Tell Overture, the music brings to life a storm on the plains, tremendous crashes of thunder, bolts of lightning, and rushing wind.Track 14 (4:02): Noble and majestic; reminds me of the John Williams refrain for the Superman movie, and his theme for the Planet Krypton in same.Track 15 (4:53): Blended from track 14, this song once again reminds me of the God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen instruments, the percussion primarily. Towards the end, they use that choir again, and it sounds really nice.Why would you want to buy this disc? That's up to you. It's great for listening to in the background, on your way home from work (or any car occasion where you need a good tune), or before you go to bed. Personally, I think this music should be combined with video footage of the amazing spectacles at Yellowstone National Park; that's the only way you could improve on this music. I love to listen to this when de-stressing. It makes me feel like I am at Yellowstone, instead of here at home doing housework. This CD was very well put together.  Hearing nature from the forest blending with the music is very pleasant to listen to. It is worth buying the CD and you won't be disappointed. I think when you really like the &#34;sound&#34; of a particular group, everything they do, you like, which is the case with the Mannheim Steamroller. One of the best pieces Mannheim Steamroller has ever done!  The mix f classical and original music fits together to create a unified whole. If you like quiet and relaxing music, this Mannheim Steamroller album is for you.  Great listening.  Makes you think you are on a quit drive through Yellowstone Mannheim Steamroller music, in general, is very pleasing to my ear.  I love the sounds of nature!  With all that goes on in our world today, it is nice to relax and be soothed by ""The Music of Nature""!  The orchestrations are beautiful! I have this on in the barn while I am working horses.  It is really very nice to listen to. I had seen some bad reviews, but I thinkthey just did not recognize the music.It is not as good as some Streamroller albums,but it what I expected. A truly eclectic mix of classical and new compositions...  fast and slow... dreamy and stirring... al sorts of music, all of it beautiful and satisfying.  Glad I bought it!! Not the usual music one expects from Mannheim Steamroller, but wonderful for a day when it'sawful outside, and you'd like to remember those beautiful days of hiking and just enjoying thewonders of being outside.  Nice addition to our CD collection ! Not all of these pieces have the recognizable Mannheim Steamroller style, but they are all very good and professionally done. I bought this to listen to on my trip out west, but I am enjoying it now, too. I'm sure Steamroller fans of the GREAT old days have realized this band is toast and totally out of ideas and have been for some time. Mega-wealth does strange things to folks, and in Chip Davis' and Jackson Berkey's case...a case of extreme laziness. While Saving the Wildlife had some previously released material, this release from 1989 is where Davis realized that ''Greatest Hits'' (so-called) collections will sell also. On this release, tracks 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, and 15 are all rehashes from previous Fresh Aire releases. I haven't been afflicted like some who have stated that listening to their masterworks of the 70s and 80s is too painful knowing what this band has now become. Fresh Aire 1-7, Saving the Wildlife, and the first two Christmas albums are still so ""fresh"" and exciting. Seeing this band just as they peaked, when they would play Fresh Aire (non-Christmas) music for the entire first half of the show in a small auditorium over the course of 5 days and nights is something I will never forget. I would say I wouldn't pay 3 cents to see them again, but they don't play live anymore. Davis 'hires' musicians to go out and play, calling themselves Mannheim Steamroller, and the money they make is turned over to Davis. That's not only cheap and lazy...it's tacky, man! No more of my money, Chip. Sorry, I work too hard for it. This is a terrific CD.  The nature of Yellowstone Park comes alive with this wonderful music from Mannheim Steamroller.  More classical than the other CD's that I have from Mannheim.  Turn the volumn up and just close your eyes and listen!  Beautiful! I had the opportunity, years and years ago, to see this album performed live at a dress rehearsal.  It was incredible.  I bought the recording on cassett back then and just placed an order for the CD.  Reading some of the reviews I realize that many people probably don't know the history of the album.  In 1988 horrible wildfires ravaged Yellowstone.  As I recall, Chip Davis created this album and donated proceeds from the album and from the concert tour to the revitalization efforts of the park.  The songs, the order they appeared in, told a story of the park, the fires and the rebirth of a wilderness.  It was a very memorable performance, even as a dress rehearsal. I've been a fan of Manheim Steamroller for years and only recently discovered this recording.  It is magnificent and I highly recommend it to everyone. I have many relaxation cds so this is another addition but not spectacular.  Their Xmas cd is better than this If you have been to Yellowstone, this cd will evoke memories, if not, it will make you want to go. Only liked one song. The rest were not up to par. Yellowstone is a magical place & the album did not capture its essence. Chip Davis composes original pieces himself to praise the nature of Yellowstone, as well as conducts Steamroller and the Yellowstone Symphony in this tribute to the natural wonder of our first national park.It truly is a most beautiful and inspiring collection of sounds, from Respighi to Debussy to Vivaldi and Grofe compositions as well as Mannheim.The Pines of Rome is exquisite, love the oboe!  The Debussey piece is majestic, remicisent of the Park's wonders.  The west theme is picked up in The Sunrise at Rhodes, as well as Grand Canyon Suite.  The oboe work by Ray Still is absolute phrase magic on Nepenthe, as well as exceptional recorder sound on Come Home to the Sea.Beautiful, soaring, ebb and flow music such as this matches so well with natural phenomenen, and certainly Yellowstone with its many cycles inspires and fits so well.Most refreshing and inspiring!  One of Steamroller gems! This is what I was looking for.  It is great background music that can easily be paid attention to when you want.  It is not all written by Chip Davis but his touch is there for most of the songs.  It is more classic than his Christmas albums. My brother loves the big sky country and Mannheim Steamroller so when this cd became available, it was a no brainer for his gift! Thanks! Anything by Mannheim Steamroller is expected to be top-notch, and this CD is.  It is a good addition to my collection.","Adult Alternative,Adult Contemporary,Progressive,Classical,Jazz,Pop,New Age,Rock,Meditation,Electronic",one return earth sounds like classic mannheim steamroller otherwise good classical probably worth paid like mannheim steamroller group another good one group buy enjoy listened c many times really liked really liked first like quot pines rome pini di villa borghese quot quot pines rome iii pini del gianicolo quot also liked called quot grand canyon suite cloudburst quot several minutes sounding little scary though like big nightmare quot yellowstone quot getting destroyed bad terrible storm coming end still great instroments playing sounded beautiful like making beauty area around yellowstone grand canyon much liked lot great th one return earth sounds classic mannheim steamroller steamroller good classical probably paid mannheim steamroller steamroller group good group group buy buy enjoy listened times really liked really liked quot pines pini pines quot liked called grand grand canyon grand canyon suite canyon suite cloudburst quot minutes sounding scary nightmare quot yellowstone quot destroyed bad terrible storm coming end great playing sounded beautiful beauty area yellowstone grand liked lot great
248,480,B0000005N9,"Great Music from Great Music from Steamroller as always as always.I love their classical modern approach to the music they do.Enjoyable to listen to their foreign, Christmas and other music.I enjoy and share this and advise my friends to purchase and enjoy the Great Music from Great Music from Steamroller. This album is a mixture of artists who have worked with Chip Davis in previous projects. Some of the songs are really good, some are not so good; in the ned it is worth the cost to add to the music collection the songs that are noteworthy. I am a freaking fan or freaky fan of Steamroller... they can take the regular score of a piece of music and make it even more special with Chip Davis's  arrangements. Their style never gets old... Saw them in concert and love to have the album on hand to relive the experience at any time I want. I have mixed feelings about this album.  In some ways, it seems like a bit of a rip-off for Mannheim Steamroller fans since it only offers one new Steamroller track (The Goodwill Games Theme), and it's not a particularly good piece of music anyway.  Technically, there is another new piece, The Fanfare, but being that it's only about a minute long and is quite unremarkable, we'll just ignore that one.  To make matters worse, Chip Davis took &quot;Dancing Flames&quot; from Fresh Aire 4 and rearranged it, making it sound thin and lifeless, which is really a shame since Dancing Flames had long been one of my favorite Steamroller pieces.On the plus side, there are some really good, older, Steamroller tracks here, such as &quot;Chakra 3&quot; and &quot;Fugue,&quot; and some of the Russian classical music is quite good.If you're a Steamroller fan, skip it.  If you're a fan of Russian Classical music, you might enjoy it, but then you might be irritated by the inclusion of the Steamroller tracks (which, in juxtaposition to the grandiose classical pieces, seem pretty hokey.)  Seems like this is a no-win situation. This is a highly recomended album.  A great mix of Russia's classical and  folk music along with some of Chip Davis's own New Age classics includung a  remake of &quot;Danceing Flames&quot; from the Fresh Aire 4 album.  Keep it  up Chip!!! Opening for this one of a kind album - &quot;To Russia With Love&quot;, is the American melody juxtaposed to a Russian melody, only the leader of Mannheim Steamroller - Chip Davis could have pulled this off.  This &quot;festival like&quot; atmosphere is the multi-national spirit sharing music from the past to present.Of course there are highlights - &quot;THE GOODWILL GAMES&quot; blends well-known themes with new counterpoints...&quot;DANCING FLAMES&quot; the upbeat tempo of Davis is in full swing - invigorating and simply intoxicating with melody penetrating the inner-rhythm strands of your being, very effective...&quot;THE GOOSE FROM SMOLENSK&quot; has festival written all over it, happy people dancing in the square with friends and relatives...&quot;FUGUE&quot; the old-masters would be proud, Davis has captured the mood with a touch of 20th Century thrown in.The booklet with liner-notes shares the background on places, recordings and the seasons...along with some great pictures showing where this was done and by whom, not to mention the Cyrillic version which reads the opposite direction, how unique.Once again Chip Davis and the Mannheim Steamroller gang have come up with an extraordinary album...exposing their fans to music from another world - the wonderful culture of the Russian people through music...Chip Davis style!Total Time: 46:10 on 14 Tracks...American Gramaphone 3094...(1994) The Russian folk songs are cool, well done.The techno-instrumental modern improvisationsare schlock.  Sorry, I just can't get in toMannheim Steamroller, no matter how hard I try.The liner notes in Russian and English were a nicetouch. I have had this cd for many years, and I still enjoy it. It includes the techno style and the traditional style. It seems like a labor of love to the world from the American and Russian musicians, done at a time when we really could appreciate, be grateful for that. Any bridge across the way to both cultures is welcome! Thanks for not only the style, verve and all, but the originality in presenting traditional music and instruments of Russia to us with Mannheim Steamroller style. A real change from the normal arrangements by one of my favoite groups. I would put it on the end of the line of this, one of my favorite groups. Excellent replacement for myself and a friend, the last one was left in the car when it was traded in and I really missed it. The friend loves it too.","Adult Alternative,Progressive,Jazz,Pop,New Age,Rock,Meditation,Electronic",great great steamroller always always love classical modern approach enjoyable listen foreign christmas enjoy share advise friends purchase enjoy great great steamroller mixture artists worked chip davis previous projects really good good ned worth cost add collection noteworthy freaking fan freaky fan steamroller take regular score piece make even special chip daviss arrangements style never gets old saw concert love hand relive experience time want mixed feelings ways seems like bit rip mannheim steamroller fans since offers one new steamroller goodw great great steamroller love classical modern approach enjoyable listen foreign christmas enjoy share advise friends purchase enjoy great great steamroller mixture artists worked chip chip davis davis previous projects really good good worth cost add collection noteworthy freaking fan freaky fan steamroller regular score piece special chip arrangements style old old saw saw concert love hand relive experience time want mixed mixed feelings feelings ways seems bit mannheim mannheim steamroller steamroller fans offers new steamroller
249,484,B0000005O7,"I'll put this one first, even before the Cobra recordings. This albums showcases the guitar work of the master a whole lot more than the Cobra recordings. The vocals are just as passionate, and the track selection is very good. In a few words: this is one of the best blues albums of all time. Its a shame that is not an easy album to find. I have just about every Otis Rush album made.  This is my most recent addition, and though tunes are very familiar, he's covered them before, the playing is at his best. To find a Blues man that can play, sing, and tell a story is great. although he has limited exposure, i would highly recommend this CD!! Buy this CD! If Rush had only ever recorded this single disk his place as a Chicago Blues great would have been secured. Add to this his incomparable late 50's sides for Cobra and you have a selection of the greatest West Side recordings ever made.'Right Place, Wrong Time', is quite simply the best straight blues recording made during the 1970's, bar none. Rush is on fire throughout, whether delivering wracked slow blues or up tempo shuuffles. He plays and sings with incredible passion and feeling throughout; constantly striving for the next lick or turn of phrase which might take these songs to a new level. The backing band are never fussy, the horn section restrained, the production sparse and tough.Highlights include the brilliant original 'Right Place, Wrong Time' and a definitive reading of Albert King's (Lets have a) 'Natural Ball'. Rush makes 'Lonely Man' his own and manages to deliver 'Rainy Night In Georgia' as a first rate blues ballad.These recordings carry none of the excesses that blight many of his later recordings, but rather capture Otis delivering at the very peak of his considerable powers. Surprisingly the album, which is considered one of the best works by Otis Rush, was declined by the Capitol Records and was released only after 5 years in 1976 on P-Vine Japan. But his fact did not make music sound old, it does not sound old even today.Blues of Otis Rush is truely original and, therefore, different from the Blues of other great performers. One can't find here chords or progressions he is accustomed with and this is not only due to his left handed style, to bigger extent this is the way of feeling the Blues. If from the first listening album does not seem attractive, listen to it second time and you'll get more fun. But you should be a seasoned Blues lover because this is an album for seasoned Blues fans only.Personnel: Otis Rush (vocals, guitar); Fred Burton (guitar); Hart McNee (alto saxophone); Rev. Ron Stallings (tenor saxophone); John Wilmeth (trumpet); Mark Naftalin (piano); Ira Kamin (organ); Bob Jones (drums).Recorded at Walley Heider Studio, San Francisco, CA in February 1971.Produced by Nick Gravenites and Otis Rush.pastblues.com This 1971 Capitol Records session was almost not released at all. Chicago blues guitarist and singer extraordinaire Otis Rush cut ""Right Place, Wrong Time"" in February of that year, and Capitol immediately decided against issuing it. It sucked, apparently. And Capitol knew about music, you see; they didn't like the Beatles and tampered heavily with their records, they refused to sign the Doors because Jim Morrison had absolutely no stage presence (!), and they cut three songs from the US version of Pink Floyd's ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" for no good reason whatsoever.""Right Place, Wrong Time"" was only saved because Capitol allowed Otis Rush's production company to buy the tapes and have them issued on P-Vine in Japan and on the tiny Bullfrog label in the USA (the CD has come out on Hightone). And it's good to have this album, a very welcome addition to Rush's sparse legacy.To me, these are not his best sides...those would be his classic Cobra recordings from the 50s. It is not even his best post-60s album. But it is still the great Otis Rush in his prime, and that means that it is head and shoulders above most other blues records of the 70s.The production is a little flat, which is surprising since it was undertaken by Rush himself and by Nick Gravenites, and while Otis Rush's strong, expressive voice and sizzling guitar playing is right there at the forefront, the rest of the band wasn't treated as well by the producers.But said sizzling guitar playing is top-notch. Rush is backed by an excellent combo which includes a three-piece horn ensemble, and the horns are very well scored, providing a terrific counterpoint to Rush's edgy lead guitar. Listen to the way the instruments compliment each other on the instrumental ""Easy Go"", or the 5-minute title track, a powerful slow soul-blues number penned by Rush himself, and a showcase for his powerful, emotional voice.A cover of ""Rainy Night in Georgia"" is an odd choice for a blues record, and this rushed version of Albert King's ""Natural Ball"" doesn't add anything to the song. But the rest is good. And frequently great. Pianist Mark Naftalin is terrific on the instrumental ""I Wonder Why"", which showcases the entire band, and if Ike Turner's ""Tore Up"" is pretty much a rip-off of ""I'm Tore Down"", it is a good rip-off. ""Your Turn to Cry"" is another smouldering slow blues, and Otis Rush does very well by Little Milton Campbell's ""Lonely Man"", and even better by his own ""Take a Look Behind"", the six-minute album closer.This album would benefit from some serious remastering, but what's here is still pretty great. Rush is a masterful guitarist, wringing some magnificent, imaginative fills and solos from his upside-down-guitar...he has a magnificent ability to transcend the usual blues clich&eacute;s.If you're new to the man, start with his classic Cobra sides, but don't forget to pick this one up as well. The overall quality of the material and the music is not quite as high as on other latter-day albums like ""Ain't Enough Comin' In"" or ""Any Place I'm Goin'"", but it is still more than worth while, not just for fans of Otis Rush, but for fans of electric Chicago blues and tasteful blues guitar in general. I'd give it ten stars if I could! Classic blues!! Get it!!This guy has been a great inspiration!! Other albums are also great! Rush's Right Place, Wrong Time is one of the greatest modern era blues recordings and may be the best electric blues album recorded after 1970. It starts off with the best cover I have ever heard of Ike Turner's Tore Up. Rush's soloing on this tune is amazing in its fire and creativity. Rush is a master of getting a hook and taking it as far as it will go. He follows this with the song that that the CD is named after; it is a  classic &quot;West Side&quot; of Chicago tune that makes excellent use of the horn section and shows that a slow blues can be dynamic and spiced up. Rush includes an instrumental cover of I Wonder Why which smokes. This is the type of blues CD that you rarely hear recorded anymore. Rush can solo with anybody, but he is original and he gets the fire from his passion and not from volume or from playing a million notes. I put this album in the same league as Magic Sam's West Side Soul, which is my favorite studio album of all time. It is a mystery as to why Rush hasn't received more acclaim and it is a travesty that this album didn't get a big push from a major label. Every tune on it is a classic. Buy it!! Otis Rush is a marvellous blues guitarist and singer, and this may be his  best album. It is certainly one of my most played album through the years.  All songs here are classics. Otis Rush's great vocals and lyrics soars  through the record, with beautiful, tormenting guitar licks by the man. The  band is also very good, led by Nick Gravenites, and with fine horn  arrangements. This is some of the most authentic soul blues you will ever  hear. My top songs are 'Right Place, Wrong time' and 'Take a look behind'.  This one should be on your stereo. I heard this record on the telly. Channel 18 it was, a public access outfit on Long Island who when The Simpsons aren't on are absolutely the best thing on the box. See, what they do is put out a round-the-clock bulletin board of upcoming community events but they back this up with entire albums, often double albums, chosen by the dudes what work there. Each record plays for a couple of days at a stretch too so you can miss it a bunch of times and still catch up. They've even got a screen with the date, time and temperature. Like I said, prime time television. These old geezers are free to broadcast just about anything that takes their fancy and mostly it's not too crappy although once they played Hank Snow and I had to take up cycling just to get out of the house. Because really Hank Snow, I mean that sap's the Andrew Llyod Webber of country music, isn't he? I sent an e-mail to the guy in charge of this gig complementing him on their choice one night of early Charlie Parker--what I don't know about jazz could fill a warehouse but this bird is the spring in wintertime--and the felly wrote back an actual letter in which he described in the most amiable manner how they do things down at Four Village Studio. Tastes there run to older acoustic and electric blues, rhythm & blues, jazz and, like I said, lots of cowboys. Over the last several months as a for instance I've watched, usually from my bed, the following compact disks: Long John Hunter's Ride With Me, Texas blues tailor made for a Saturday afternoon. I own this record now on account of buying it there recently because it's just that good; Bob Dylan's John Wesley Harding where he sings that song about Saint Augustine--as perfect a number as that man ever rolled. I love Dylan, his Chronicles are stupendously cranky and funny and I for one am eagerly awaiting volumes two and three. I didn't think much of David Crosby until I read this book but his crack after the Princeton debacle is a thing of beauty; A Junior Parker compilation which I'm pretty certain I remember not minding one bit; Celtic Solstice by Paul Winter and Friends, a processed slab of Irish cheese that made me want to fly into O'Hare International Airport and drink a lump of pints in The Green Potato; the first two albums by The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, a double CD and Jehesius H. Horselips just a mongo kablammo twofer--red barn blues and on disk two the incomparable Elvin Bishop crooning some serious voodoo on Never Say No; and this record here by Otis Rush, searing big band electric blues, the perfect prescription for shutting up shop on a Sunday night. The thing about this record is that all the good bits--lead guitar, bass, drums, keyboards and brass--come through on their own but somehow stay together in a right snazzy arrangement. It's like one of those glass clocks you often find on mantlepieces where you can clearly see the whole gizmo actually ticking but in the wind up you still get the right time. I own this record now too so I do on account of it also is just that good. If you're one of ""Shaq's, The King Of The World Blues Reviewer's"" loyal fans, you'll know that I love Otis, and he is one of my six all-time favorite electric blues guitarist's. My prior reviews of his CD's, all have exemplary reviews. But this CD, fails two of Shaq's critical tests. First, the volume and clarity of this CD is terrible. I had to turn up the sound on my stereo louder than on any prior reviewed CD. Second, there are a total of 10 songs on this CD, and the total running time of the entire CD is 40 minutes. So as Shaq always says: ""You can't get da blues in 3-4 minutes. Summary: If you're the type of person who likes to turn your portable CD player up to it's highest volume, and sneak up behind someone you're stalking, and not have them know you're behind them, this is the CD for you! Playing this CD at its highest level won't bother the librarian, or your neighbors. Otis Rush is one of the greatest singers and guitarists in the history of the blues.  ""Right Place, Wrong Time"" is his unmistakeable masterpiece, far surpassing the Cobra recordings, his initial reputation was built on, and setting a standard he unfortunately never quite reached again.  Over ten songs (four of which are originals) he conveys a lifetime of sadness, pain and passion through his tasteful guitar playing and soulful singing.  When he sings ""they say there's someone for everybody/ Ooooh I wonder where in the world is the one for me,"" on the title track it's the poetry of loneliness brought to life.  The final song ""Take a Look Behind"" is one of the most moving songs about the regret over a life badly lived in all the blues.  There isn't a dud on here though.  Every track is a thing of beauty.I first bought this album on vinyl in the 80s and nearly wore it out.  The CD I replaced it with continues to get plenty of air time on my home stereo.  No blues collection can be complete without this disk. From a fellow guitarist's perspective, this album is a masterpiece.  The well-placed silence between mesmerizing, shimmering guitar licks is deafening.  Otis is masterful at telling a story or setting a mood with the confluence of his anguished singing, espressive guitar-playing, and impeccable timing.  What sets him apart from other, perhaps flashier, guitarists, is the patience he shows while telling a story---i.e., the spaces between guitar playing, the patience in holding a note.  His phrasing on the guitar is simply hypnotic.  One of his secrets is that he puts on a silky-smooth vibrato while deftly bending the string---a difficult task for many.I wish more current blues musicians played like this---less busy noise going-on,...His other indispensable studio album is &quot;Cold Day in Hell,&quot; which has even sparser, intense playing, and perhaps a better, upfront tone.For a great LIVE album of Otis, I would suggest TOPS, or else LIVE IN EUROPE. OK, Otis Rush is my favorite and of all his studio work this is his most legendary, but with VERY GOOD REASON!  If you like the blues and you don't know Otis Rush yet, do yourself a favour and buy this album.  It features Otis' brilliant guitar playing and impassioned vocals.  In Robert Palmer's Deep Blues the legendary Muddy Waters says that Otis has a voice like the old timers, and his guitar playing helped inspire Clapton early on.  Otis' gutar cuts and weaves through these tracks, and his voice is warm and impassioned.  Check out his version of &quot;Rainy Night In Georgia&quot; which deserves to be more famous than Brook Benton's.  I think it's the albums hidden gem, because many of Otis' signature tunes that he still plays live to this day take up the rest of the album.

250,485,B0000005PS,"My oh my, Muntana will make you cry.I have rarely heard such a deeply moving song. It's a confronting and true story that American listeners may relate to, as it recalls the tragedy of a young man and his native Australian mother, Muntana (pronounced Mun-ya-na). He was taken from her by the authorities as a young child and adopted out to a family in the US. I don't know the whole story but he ended up on the wrong side of the tracks as they say and was eventually convicted of rape and murder a few years back. The death of a young woman, the incarceration and potential death of a young man, three damaged families. Tragedy upon tragedy - the song asks who will shed a tear for Muntana.I actually did cry and it's not usual for me to do that while listening to music. Archie also tells the tale of his own redemption from the drunken hell of his lost years on the grog. Deeply moving stuff and full of hope despite the undertone of sorrow and loss. Archie Roach is not only unknown in the US (see last reviewer comments), but also not terribly well known in mainstream Australia. He is one of several Australian singer-songwriters to be associated with Paul Kelly, (who deserves a lot of credit for lending his name and influence to artists who have a great deal to contribute but scant opportunity), and shares some of Kelly's uncomplicated, storytelling songwriting style. I bought Charcoal Lane years ago after I saw Roach perform at the Royal Derby Hotel in Brunswick St., Fitzroy - an inner suburb of Melbourne where Roach spent a great deal of time in his youth - and was immediately affected by the pure emotion in &quot;Took the Children Away&quot;, an autobiographical piece that draws on the experiences of both Roach and his wife. Roach has trodden a hard road, among other things beating alcohol, prejudice and the experience of being removed from his family at a young age, part of the infamous &quot;stolen generation&quot; of koorie children removed from their families in Australia in the 50's and 60's under the then government's reprehensible &quot;White Australia&quot; policy.  Other songs, such as the title track and &quot;Down City Streets&quot;, tell of life in Melbourne's inner city, while &quot;Native Born&quot; details the depth of aboriginals' connection with the land and nature.The wonderful thing about Roach's art is the straightforward manner in which he talks about his heritage, his experiences and his struggles without surrendering to bitterness or hatred. Artists such as Roach, Kev Carmody, Paul Kelly, Yothu Yindi and Midnight Oil (to name a few) have played a critical role in informing the Australian public about issues central to the aboriginal psyche in such a manner as to educate without leveling blame in an overly aggressive fashion, allowing the public to come to terms with a shameful chapter in Australia's past without blame-shifting and defensiveness. The result has been an admittedly slow, but clear shifting of national sentiment (particularly amongst the younger generation) towards reconciliation between black and white Australia, a process that most reasonable people see as both inevitable and necessary, and which most recently led to the symbolic (and almost universally acclaimed) choice of Cathy Freeman to ignite the Olympic flame in Sydney.Anyone interested in uncomplicated honesty and a clear example of the unparalleled ability of music to communicate, educate and facilitate healthy dialog about difficult and complex issues could do much worse than listen to this wonderful piece of music. Its uncomplicated, straightforward style is rewarding and accessible on a number of levels, and to my mind ranks amongst the most important pieces of Australian music of the last 25 years. Archie Roach's songs are beautiful and touching, but work best if you don't listen too closely to the words.  If you do you will find that many of them are incredibly depressing.  I absolutely love his music and have almost all of his albums, despite being an American.  Believe it or not I am generally a hard rock fan so for me to like these this much they MUST be good! Real is the only word to describe this album. The heartfelt passion that Archie Roach puts into each one of his songs is amazing. From songs about the pain his people have felt to the beautiful spirit of his people, this  album fully moves you. Arguably one of the great albums of all time. Archie Roach is, as near as I can tell, virtually unknown in North America.  That is a shame, because he is one of the most life-affirming singer-songwriters I know of.  All three of his albums are terrific.  He, perhaps, can be characterized as having a voice that is cross between Ray Charles and Sam Cooke.  I wouldn't exactly call it pretty, but it is a powerfully effective vehicle for some of the most gut-wrenching songs around.  I will only mention one from CHARCOAL LANE, &quot;Took the Children Away.&quot;  I suspect this is a mostly autobiographical indictment of Australia's anti-aboriginal racist policies that took Roach from his parents as a young child, ending with a word of hope, &quot;I came back.&quot;","Folk Rock,Australia & New Zealand,Jazz,Pop,Traditional Jazz & Ragtime,World Music,Rock,Traditional Folk,Folk",oh muntana make cry rarely heard deeply moving confronting true story american listeners may relate recalls tragedy young man native australian mother muntana pronounced mun ya na taken authorities young child adopted family us dont know whole story ended wrong side say eventually convicted rape murder years back death young woman incarceration potential death young man three damaged families tragedy upon tragedy asks shed tear muntana actually cry usual listening archie also tells tale redemption drunken hell lost years grog deeply moving stuff full hope despite undertone sorrow loss archie roach unknown us see last reviewer comme oh cry rarely heard deeply confronting true true story story american listeners relate recalls tragedy young young man man native australian mother pronounced mun authorities young child adopted family know story ended wrong wrong side side say eventually convicted rape murder years death young young woman woman incarceration potential death young young man man damaged families tragedy tragedy asks shed tear actually cry usual listening archie tells tale redemption drunken hell lost years grog deeply stuff full hope undertone sorrow loss archie roach unknown see reviewer
251,491,B0000005S8,"should have written this review years ago. I have been listening to Butterboy since its release. From the outset is this not the best cover to a CD you've ever seen, a picture speaks a thousand words, Looking for Butterboy, beautiful. You might have to listen to it all first to fully get it.The songs themselves are things to be treasured, Archie probably in his finest voice throughout his recording career. My favourites, the soaring Watching Over Me, just sing along and let it take you away, the wonderfully bluesy Reach for  You, and A Child was Born Here, but also Give unto Ceasar and Louis St John, all original sounds, no commercialism here, soulful stuff, from the heart. Thank you Archie This man's music is another wonderful thing I brought home from Australia.  Many Australian performers work with or cover songs by Archie, and to listen to this CD is to understand the true depth of the man's music.  He can be very political and social in his songs; in that respect, he seems to be a mellow version of Australia's Midnight Oil, and with good reason.  His political and social songs are less preachy and more of him dealing openly and honestly with his childhood and teen-age years.  He was a stolen child (meaning he is an Aboriginal that was forcibally taken from his family by the government) and that resonates in many of his songs on this and previous CD's.  Songs like &quot;My Grandmother&quot;  &quot;F Troop&quot; &quot;Mother's Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;Louis St John&quot; have definitive politcal lyrics without wanting to blame people, something I find most writers of musical political material can not accomplish.  &quot;Djabugai Lady&quot; is a love song that makes you sing the chorus, and &quot;Reach For You&quot; is probably the most soulful, honest, heartfelt and acoustic love song you'll hear for the next twenty years!  This is the CD to start with if you want to start listening to Archie Roach.  He'll have you &quot;Dancing with My Spirit&quot;  (or your spirit) without caring who leads. Thanks, Malcolm Burn, for letting Archie rock! &quot;Djabugai Lady,&quot; &quot;Hold On Tight,&quot; and &quot;Give Unto Caesar&quot; break free in fine garage band fashion...but it's free of shallow adolescent pretences that one may associate with three-chord guitar music. Much of the record remains &quot;folk music,&quot; but Archie is branching out into neighboring genres. I'm hoping to hear Archie sing more rock songs on future albums.Archie Roach is one of the English-speaking world's top-shelf songwriters and singers. Archie doesn't sing about &quot;getting the girl&quot; but about loving your wife...if you are man enough. Archie sings about protecting the children's home (&quot;A Child Was Born Here&quot;), about how a grandmother can inspire a boy to resist the stains of ethnic discrimination (&quot;My Grandmother&quot;), and praise the nurturing qualities of mothers (&quot;My Mother's Heartbeat&quot;). This is Archie again, as he did in the &quot;Charcoal Lane&quot; and &quot;Jamu Dreaming&quot; albums, singing about one of the most personal set of issues around -- our very own families.Archie's family journal comes with a soundtrack! Next comes the documentary film? I hope so...because more of the world needs to find Butter Boy...and listen to his stories.","Australia & New Zealand,Pop,Traditional Folk,World Music,Rock,Folk",written review years ago listening butterboy since release outset best cover cd youve ever seen picture speaks thousand words looking butterboy beautiful might listen first fully get things treasured archie probably finest voice throughout recording career favourites soaring watching sing along let take away wonderfully bluesy reach child born also give unto ceasar louis st john original sounds commercialism soulful stuff heart thank archie mans another wonderful thing brought home australia many australian performers work cover archie listen cd understand true depth mans political social respect seems mellow version australias written review years years ago listening release outset best cover cd seen picture speaks words looking beautiful listen fully things treasured archie probably voice recording career favourites soaring watching sing sing along let take away wonderfully bluesy reach child born john original original sounds sounds commercialism soulful stuff heart thank archie mans wonderful brought brought home home australia australian performers work cover archie listen cd understand true depth mans political social respect seems mellow version australias

The band's odd sense of humour and less than conventional Punk style is quite divisive. Just take a close look: Vocalist/guitarist Olga has a reedy, girly sounding voice, despite being a bloke; their greatest hit is a cover of ""Nellie The Elephant"", a song popular in kindergartens the world over; and much of the subject matter of the songs is utterly trivial. So, as you'd expect, they're big Japan...This live album was recorded in Tokyo in December 1989, at a time when Punk was apparently at a low ebb, only no one told the Japanese. Coronation Street obviously wouldn't have been huge in Japan in 1989, but the audience was still full of enthusiasm for shouting ""slag, slag, slag!"" at the appropriate moment in the irreverent, but still oh-so-relevant ""Deirdre's A Slag"", with kazoo intro intact. Other songs which might not have translated well include ""Cloughy Is A Bootboy"", ""Ashbrooke Laundrette"", ""My Girfriends Dad's A Vicar"" and ""She Goes To Finos"", but the sheer child-like joy of the uncomplicated melodies and the pure silliness of it all seems to cross all cultural barriers.Elsewhere, there's sheer rampant absurdity. ""Spiders In The Dressing Room"" is the ultimate wimp out song. What bloke would ever admit to being scared of spiders? ""Dig That Groove Baby"" sounds like Spike Milligan on amphetamines, silly voices, nonsensical lyrics and all.Anyone who tells you Punk is about three chords and 4/4 beats, and that's it, has obviously never heard this band. OK, most of the songs are fairly straight forward, but Olga is a great guitarist. ""Wakey Wakey Intro"", and ""Wakey Wakey Outro"" for that matter, show off the man's skills, but the best example is ""Sabre Dance"", a tricky little rearrangement of the traditional Cossack tune. There are also solos peppered throughout the set, not perfect, but fun anyway.And then, of course, there's that song about that stupid elephant. Hear it once and you'll be hearing ""off she went/with a trumpety trump/ trump trump trump"" in your subconscious for days. The single originally sold 500,000 copies, so not hearing it live would be like Mot&ouml;rhead without ""Ace Of Spades"".Mistakes by the band and in the mixing can't detract from the obvious riot of good time tunes. This will annoy ""serious"" Punk fans, and is too camp by far for most Rock fans.

I guarantee that if you crank this up loud enough your head will explode ( or definitely your speakers ). I literally turned my speaker's into confetti with this one . The first half is Extreme Noise Terror's debut grindcore release. My favorite track being &quot;You really make me sick&quot;. The second half is Chaos UK , not as catchy as their earlier material , but alot more raw and aggressive. Words simply cannot describe the extreme noise terror and chaos of this album. Scare your parents and buy it. This record is the equivalent of a 12 megaton nuclear warhead!!  I remember getting this split L.P. in about 87 and having a religious expierience.  The Chaos U.K. is great on this disc, a bit different than most of their other recordings.  But the meat of the disc is EXTREME NOISE TERROR, when that feedback comes hammering in on the first track System Sh*t World War III is on for the next 15 to 20 minutes.  It just doesn't get any better than this, no one before or since has captured the raw political energy being unleashed on this classic recording!

257,499,B0000005WD,"Yes, beautiful. You probably don't hear that word used to describe a hardcore punk rock CD often, but this one deserves it. It has some of the usual hardcore punk rock songs, meaning they are short and fast. These songs are very good. This CD also contains a lot of slower songs, but they still sound hardcore. These slower songs are amazing! Jesus Was a Communist, Queen Babylon, and Heavy Metal Shuffle are some of the best songs on A Collection of Pop Classics, and they could be considered ""stoner"" music, meaning they are long, drawn out, and have great guitar playing.If you are interested, search the Internet for a short biography telling about lead singer Dave Insurgent's life, it is pretty sad, but very interesting. A great Cd the first 9 songs are your average fast punk but still very very good songs but after that you can start to see the effects of the Heroin and their music gets much slower and longer and drones but in the best of ways I recommend &quot;No Class&quot; and &quot;One Holy Bible&quot; Reagan Youth Presonofied Mid 80's Hardcore classic punk from youthful lads in the early 80s.  i probably shouldn't be reviewing this as i only have the volume 1 lp (songs 1-10 on commie red vinyl!) and have only heard two of the other songs, but...shut up!  buy it! When I first heard this CD I was really impressed. I was really enjoying the catchy old school hardcore punk tunes like ""Reagan Youth"", ""New Arayns"", ""(Are You) Happy?"", ""No Class"", and ""USA"". Then suddenly about halfway through the CD everything went downhill. Honestly the second half isn't as good as the first half. So all in all if you like old hardcore punk then check this out, but be prepared for some not so great songs alongside the great songs. I remember, long ago before the internet took hold on our brains and our fingertips when the early days of punk rock communication were based off of the scenes strongest element in the word of mouth or a telephone call... I was at school when I heard David had killed himself from a friend who came in class late. I think my friends and I were at a loss. Reagan Youth had just put out their second LP fairly recently on Nicky Garret's New Red Archives label. I actually wept later over my beer that evening as my crew got together and blaired the ""Youth Anthems For The New Order"" and ""Volume 2"" LP's in continuos rotation. Reagan Youth were one of those narly hardcore bands that got you through and shaped your life as a kid. The sounds of DYS, Agression, X, Slime (Germany), D.O.A., The Subhumans (Canadian), DDT, SS Decontrol, The Stalin, Manson Youth, Neon Christ, U.K. Subs, the list goes on were all an integral part shaping me as a youth both musically and intellectually. Reagan Youth were a very powerful force whether it be the humorous beligerence against society from the early days or the conceptual rantings from the second LP. I know Dave took a bad spiral and I understand why he took the way out that he chose. Life in itself is complex, painful and there are no guarantees that you will ever have a happy ending. If you don't have this already buy it!!DIE UNTERMENSCHEN Reagan Youth started out as raw as any young group could in NY in the early hardcore-punk days.  Semi comparable to DRI or Suicidal Tendencies Reagan Youth mixed simple guitar riffs with raw leads (Queen Babylon, One Holy Bible, etc). I own the two single LPs Vol 1 and 2 and you hear the band grow lyrically, and instrument wise as the years pass.Sadly the band fell apart like alot of groups from the time did with the death of Dave Insurgent whom had been semi-exiled from the scene previous to his death.  Reagan Youth now tours with a new frontman for reunion purposes I guess.  I cant justify seeing them.  Dead Kennedys had a $20 concert 20 minutes from my house a few years ago.  But what the hell is DK without Jello Biafra.Anyways to new punk fans and old school punks alike this cd should be in everyones collection.  Even non punk fans should find some musical connection to some track.  Lates and FU....... Must have for your Hardcore collection. A satirical look at American society: Sexs, Drugs, Guns, and Rock and Roll. Don't let the pictures fool you, this band has nothing to do with NAZI's. If you are a fan of 80's hardcore, there is no reason for you to not own this cd.  While some people may complain about the change in song structures towards the end of the album, I think it makes for a better listen.  This collection of songs is a perfect introduction to what hardcore used to be, and you can even see the metal influence creeping in toward the end of the cd.  It has been said that Reagan Youth were adding the metal sounds as more of a joke than anything, but it still makes for an intriguing listen. The riffs are heavy and the drums are fast what more can I say other then this is an amazing hardcore album. I'd reccomend this to any fan of punk or hardcore.Favorite Songs: ""New Aryans"" ""Happy"" and ""Jesus Was A Communist"" I am sick of everyone trashing volume two.  Yes volume one is a staple, classic hardcore nyc political punk record... But volume two is a great record as well.  You can't make the same record twice, and especially when they are spaced out over so many years.  And most of the band members were gone for volume two, so a whole new lineup is going to equal a different sound. I don't care what any of the purists say, volume two is just as important as volume one, and so what if it has a slight metal sound to it... Discharge did too, and earlier, but noone questions their credentials as british ANARCHO icons... So don't let the volume two bashers deter you from buying this record... It is non stop great from front to back... 6 stars out of 5. This is good 80's hardcore,If you are new to punk I suggest you pick this up and add it to your collection. TIME TO BUST OUT THE OLD LPS.THESE GUYS WERE DOWN RIGHT SENSATIONAL. OWN A MASTER CLASSIC. ALL THE SONGS HERE ARE '5'STARS. words cant express how good this cd is. only bad thing about reagan youth is they are no more.... if i could only recommend one cd to you check this one out. and check out 'the banned' as well. similar feel to theyre music and ALSO a local band here in nycRIP Dave Rubinstein Until the track ""Jesus Was A Communist,"" this is a flawless, breakneck speed early 80's hardcore disc.  After that point, it gets a bit too metal-ish for my taste (I mean, come on.... there's practically a guitar solo on What Will the Neighbors Think.)So, I gave this 4 Stars instead of 5.  Additionally, I gave it 4 instead of 3 because it's an important piece of musical history (which I'm sure that Reagan Youth would find pretty funny) and because the first 11 tracks are so great. My friend taped a few Reagan Youth songs for me way back in the day.  I liked them a lot, especially ""Beutiful Day"" which sounded to me like it was describing the design of a Grateful Dead t-shirt.  Who knows?  Maybe it was.Good dose of New York style hardcore; loud, fast, snotty.

Way better than the Adolescents, Descendents and Circle Jerks. The music is very intelligent here.10 stars for the whole cd. Social Unrest is really a very underrated band. A must for all the fans of hardcore-punk. This is one of the best bands to come out of the early 80's, I have been listening to this stuff at least once a week since I was 13yrs, old and I am now 34 so that should say enough all in it self. I had the chance to see Social Unrest with (Jason Honea) back in the 80's, open up for Sonic Youth (great bill). Talk about different scene's together. I grew up with their old singer (Creetin K-os) and liked him very much, but their sound was typical at the time. Thats why I spent more time listening to PUNK from differt countries around the world. When I bought SU-2000...I fliped. It really move me, MUSIC, LYRICS, SOUND and when I saw the way he trashed about the stage...riped the microphone from the cord people knew(Sonic Youth fans)...that he moved people. Witch was hard for two different scene's at the time. Forget the PUNK bands that you can think of. Social Unrest is (which is very sad) a UNDER RATED PUNK BAND...and can go toe to toe with any of them! AND IT'S 2006.....LISTEN UP The first 7 or so songs on this cd are among the best American Punk I have ever heard. The music is extremely raw like punk should always be, yet somehow Social Unrest can combine the catchiest twists in their songs that only adds to the intensity. I like the second vocalist on the second half of the cd less, but its still really good. This album is a must-buy for the first seven songs. Social Unrest definetly needs to be appreciated by more people who are into punk...the first 7 songs are at least as good or better than early Black Flag and Circle Jerks. These recordings sound like they were recorded in a garage by a bunch of teenagers...wait that is exactly what this is. While I'm a huge fan of later SU work this early work is really rough and not very unique or even legible really. Usually I'm a completist with bands I love but I just don't see me listening to this collection. I recommend the second volume whole-heartedly. I'm sure there are some early days purists who will insist this is when the band was &#34;real&#34; and all that jive but in this case that just doesn't work I'm afraid.","Alternative Rock,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore,Hardcore & Punk",elements combined first full length su included simply one best hardcore time way better adolescents descendents circle jerks intelligent stars whole cd social unrest really underrated band must fans hardcore punk one best bands come early listening stuff least week since yrs old say enough self chance see social unrest jason honea back open sonic youth great bill talk different scenes together grew old singer creetin k os liked much sound typical time thats spent time listening punk differt countries around world bought su fliped really move lyrics sound saw way trashed stage riped microphone elements combined full full length length su included simply best hardcore time way better adolescents descendents circle circle jerks jerks intelligent stars cd social social unrest unrest really underrated band fans hardcore hardcore punk punk best bands come early listening stuff week yrs old say self chance see social social unrest unrest open sonic sonic youth youth great bill talk different scenes grew old singer k os os liked sound typical time spent spent time time listening punk countries world bought really lyrics sound saw way trashed stage microphone
259,503,B0000005XP,"""Aimless Love"" is probably the mellowest, and one of the most approachable, of all of John Prine's albums.  The lyrics depart from the elliptical approach used in ""Common Sense"" and other albums. The tunes flow on from song to song.  My favorites are ""Be My Friend Tonight"", ""The Oldest Baby in the World"" (featured on most of Prine's compilation albums), ""Unwed Fathers"" (a duet with first wife Rachel Pure Prine), and the irrepressible ""Bottomless Lake"", which I've performed in public a couple of times.  It takes me back to my days growing up in central New York state, as Prine sings ""we rented a car at the Erie Canal, but the car didn't have no brakes,"" and harks back to those disastrous family vacations, a la Chevy Chase.  We never fell in a bottomless lake, but we did get rear ended by a drug and weapon-bearing hit and run driver on street corner in Phoenix.  I would have enjoyed a couple more edgy tunes and lyrics, but the overall effect is still a very listenable (albeit short) record. Prine isn't for everyone (boy, are the others missing out!), but for some of us he is everything.  Over 20 years on and this album holds its own.  I've been a fan for 40 years now, and he hasn't failed me yet.  After all of these years I'll finally get to see him live in June...forth row center...and I can't wait. If I were pressed, really hard, to pick my favorite John Prine record, this would be it.  The gentleness and affection with which Prine approaches human weakness is quite moving, as is his skill expressing it.  This is a mature and finely crafted album, with mystifying songs of pathetic love (&quot;Maureen&quot;), mildly scolding morality tales (&quot;Unwed Fathers&quot;), a patent-pending Prine-style nonsense song (&quot;Bottomless Lake&quot;), and the ethereal, life-affirming lullaby, &quot;Only Love.&quot;  Prine took five years to organize his life so that he could make the records he wanted to make, and the results straight out the gate were pretty impressive.  Highly, highly recommended. This album is not as Joe Sixpack has noted in his review. Perhaps too many sixpacks have clouded his judgemnt. This album at best is a commercial flop and is nowhere near some of Prine's other work. This work cannot and does not rise to the level of Sam Stone, Christmas in Prison or the funny ditty ""Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian"". Prine has had numerous other albums that deserve Grammy recognition but I'm sorry to say this is the weakest link in all his work. I wish him well in his sales of this piece of work but I'm not impressed. He is too good of a talent and entertainer to let this stand as a representative of his music. He really should withdraw this album from the public and redo it with better stuff. I expected more. I really love John Prine's music.  Aimless Love's title track is the best on the c.d.  I also enjoy Unwed Fathers.  John Prine has a way of making you think about the way we all treat other people.","Contemporary Folk,Country,Pop,Traditional Folk,Singer-Songwriters,Rock,Folk",aimless love probably mellowest one approachable john prines lyrics depart elliptical approach used common sense tunes flow favorites friend tonight oldest baby world featured prines compilation unwed fathers duet first wife rachel pure prine irrepressible bottomless lake ive performed public couple times takes back days growing central new york state prine sings rented car erie canal car didnt brakes harks back disastrous family vacations la chevy chase never fell bottomless lake get rear ended drug weapon bearing hit run driver street corner phoenix would enjoyed couple edgy tunes lyrics overall effect still listenable albeit short record prine isnt everyone boy others aimless aimless love love probably approachable john lyrics depart elliptical approach used common common sense sense tunes flow favorites friend tonight baby world featured prines compilation unwed fathers duet wife rachel pure prine irrepressible bottomless lake performed public couple times takes back days growing central new new york new york state state prine sings rented car erie erie canal canal car brakes harks harks back disastrous family vacations chase fell bottomless lake rear ended drug drug weapon weapon bearing hit run driver street street corner corner enjoyed couple edgy tunes lyrics overall effect listenable short record prine isnt boy
260,504,B0000005XR,"This is my all-time favorite John Prine album, and I'm a long-time fan.  How can you top a line like &quot;You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness&quot;?  The backups are just right for these songs, too.  Listen  through headphones to get all the subtleties.  Like another reviewer, at  first I prefered other takes on Paradise, but now I think I like this one  at least as well. I once heard John Prine described as a lesser Jimmy Buffet.  I don't know if that holds true, as I don't really life jimmy buffet, but the vein of music is roughly the same...I suppose...If Jimmy Buffet lives in margaritaville, John Prine probably lives in whiskey-sourville.  Anyway, I like it. This is a great CD with many good cuts but does not measure up to the soulful melancholy that I find so soothing in his ""Fair and Square"" album. It has some funny tunes tho. It arrived in a million pieces. So far, I have not found any damage to the CD, itself, but who knows? A true master of songs one can listen to forever, along with a great band, his music is truly timeless. Man, this is good stuff by the master songwriter John Prine, backed up by New Grass Revival, a tight bluegrass group that mainstreams on progressive bluegrass, giving Prine an added touch to this album. This album kicks off with A.P. Carter's ""Lulu Walls"", a good upbeat bluegrass song and then on to Prine's classic ""Speed of the Sound of Loneliness"".  Some added favorites are, ""oh,my stars,my,Linda Goes to Mars"", ""Out of Love,and I'm out of you"" and ""Sailing Around, and I can't get back to you"", and Who else none other than Prine would write a song like, ""Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian"", the man is a genius.  Kristofferson once said, ""John Prine is God's favorite songwriter"" and that's not entirely unbelievable, although Kristofferson ain't no slacker in the songwriting department. Most of these songs are Prine originals, except for Lulu Walls and They'll Never Take Her Love From Me, a Leon Payne composition, and an ol' Hank Williams standard. German Afternoons is laid back John Prine, and is also one of his very best. I enjoy this CD very much especially the song ""The speed of sound of loneliness. I have looked and looked for this album in Hawaii because of our all-time favorite ""Let's talk dirty in Hawaiian.""Amazon.com is the ONLY place to go when you are looking for a particular song, but don't know what album. This album is one of the greatest accomplishments of western civilization!  It's up there with the White Album.  Prine is this planet's greatest living songwriter, and they're all here on this one.  The  bluegrass-flavored band he uses throughout the recording is a top notch  bunch of fellows.  This is the best thing he's ever done, and if you don't  agree, you can come to my house and I will personally apologize to you in  my front yard. If you are a John Prine fan, this CD is a must have.

Highlights include &quot;Fish And Whistle&quot; and &quot;Sabu Visits The Twin Cities Alone.&quot;Overall rating: Three and a half stars. 10 songs. That's it, but in those 10 songs, and under 40 minutes, is music that is both singable and as deep as the deepest ocean in the world. It is my opinion that no other artist could sing John Prine songs, and even come close to or sound like John Prine. He is a musical treasure. A lengend, a genius, a poet, a singer, a songwriter, a visionary, a storyteller, a comic, a regular guy. All of these things define John Prine, but there are so many things that you can say about John Prine it is remarkable. He truly is a living legend who never became as popular as other artists who did not take the risks he did, but he did not really take risks, he was just being himself and writing about things that he was feeling at that particular time. But the funny thing was, that everyone else felt the same way he did. John Prine is one of America's all time great song writers yet is almost  completely unknown in mainstream pop culture. What a shame, and what a loss  for anyone who hasn't tuned into John Prine at one time or another. Bruised  Orange is a classic piece of John's history with intelligently written  songs that always seem to make you reflect on subject matter that usually  just slips by in our day to day life. I still shake my head at the poetic  beauty of the chain of sorrow line from the title track. I highly recommend  this CD to anyone wanting to get their feet wet in the John Prine Life's  lessons experience. Folk legend John Prine's albums are all somewhere between good and excellent, and ""Bruised Orange"" is one of the best.  The opener, ""Fish and Whistle"" and ""That's the Way the World Goes Round"", have been played countless times at open mike shows in my hometown of Baton Rouge and many other places I would imagine.  ""If You Don't Want My Love"" certainly sounds a lot different from the other more folksy selections, but I still like it--it just presents another side of Prine's songwriting ability. My other favorites are the title track, which as another reviewer noted features a poetic refrain about the wages of anger ""for a heart stained with anger grows weak and grows bitter, you become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there wrapped up in a trap of your very own chain of sorrow.""--unmatchable lyricism--and the closing ""Hobo Song"", which features another great chorus ""could it be that time has gone and left them tied up in life's eternal traveling sack,"" sung by the ""Hobo Chorus"", which in producer Steve Goodman's able hands sounds very much like you'd expect a chorus of hobos to sound. Where do I start with this great, great album? Funny, tender, heartfelt, a little funky and folky ; John Prine touches all the bases with this grand slam. He's recorded so many wonderful albums over the years, all of them packed with memorable songs, but this one remains my favorite of the bunch. I'm not saying it's the best --- that's such a subjective thing --- but this remains my most loved and cherished of all his albums. A sentimental choice because it was the first studio album (other than the first ""Best Of"") that I purchased by him back in the late 70s, and one that I never get tired of listening to. there is a reason this is a classic One of my two favourite John Prine albums, the other being the more recent ""Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings"".  And Prine followers will know the ""happy enchilada"" reference from his live performances ... this was the album where it appeared first! While this album is just as wonderful as the reviewers below have said, and a classic of the singer-songwriter genre, I want to cast a vote in favor of the cut &quot;If You Don't Want My Love&quot; which is much-maligned below.  While it has none of the whimsy and humor which characterize most of Prine's work, it is in fact a perfect encapsulation of a bitter cast-off lover's state of mind -- and stays on and on in the memory.  It is in fact my favorite cut on the album! I am in the process of slowly replacing old favorites that I've had on cassettes, and I'm almost embarrassed to say, 8-tracks LOL  This past week was John Prine's turn. People, such as myself, who have know of John Prine's music are the most fortunate around.  Get to know him, his words and music.  They are the best ! Wow! I forgot just how terrific John Prine is.  I purchased this album (yes, album...it was THAT long ago!) when it first came out and was blown away by Prine's wit &amp; perception.  I listened to the sample tracks and could still sing along...my favorite being &quot;That's the way that the World goes round&quot;.  I highly recommend this CD to everyone!  I'm off to purchase it myself! I really like john prines music, but when I receive a defective CD from the seller and wants me to pay for return shipping on a product I already payed for once, It's just not worth my time over a $10.00 CD. My shipping costs are almost as much as the CD. I'll take my business elsewhere and eat the cost of a defective CD and shipping. This album is filled with examples of the wonderful songwriting, easy delivery and comfortable performing style that define the greatness of John Prine, one of America's finest singer-songwriters.  The production, by long-time Prine pal Steve Goodman, is excellent -- clear, uncluttered and unpretentious.  Every song on this collection is a gem, and the mood varies like a soft breeze from track to track -- the journey is over far too soon.There are great examples of Prine's strengths here.  His famous humor nudges us in 'Fish and whistle', 'That's the way that the world goes round', 'There she goes', 'Iron ore Betty', 'Aw heck' and 'Crooked piece of time' -- and his incredible poignancy graces 'Sabu visits the Twin Cities alone', 'Bruised orange' and the lovely, haunting set-closer 'Hobo song'.I once saw Prine appear on the wonderful PBS program 'Austin City Limits' -- and I noticed he was chewing gum on stage during his set.  He was probably the kid who chewed it in class as well -- appearing to spit it out when the teacher caught him, then commencing to work on it again when authority's back was turned.  Everybody loves a clown -- and this one has a sensitive side as well.  This album -- along with Goodman's JESSIE'S JIG (from the same era) is a great example of the genre.  Don't miss it. Long time fan of John Prine.  Already have all of his vinyl that was put out before CDs, including Bruised Orange.  But wanted to start replacing all of the scratchy vinyl with clear CD recordings.The title song and ""The Hobo Song"" are particulary good. Prine is an American treasure. As one reviewer very adroitly put it, he's a musical Mark Twain.While it's tough to push aside a masterpiece like his ""Diamonds in the Rough"", or the sparkling collection of songs that is ""Common Sense,"" I have to say that if there is one Prine album to own, it's this one (with the exception, of course, of his astonishing 1971 debut album, ""John Prine""). 1976's ""Bruised Orange"" has all the loopy, poetic accessibility of his prior work, but it's not as dense and abstract as some of his later (still extremely good) stuff, in which I feel Steve Goodman's loss is sorely felt.Oh, the lines!""We were a regular Dr. Jekyll, but together we were Mr. and Mrs. Hyde."" (There She Goes)""Yesterday morning an ill wind came/ Blew your picture right out of the picture frame."" (Crooked Piece of Time)""I've got rug burns on my elbows/ She's got 'em on her knees."" (Iron Ore Betty)--And, of course, the outlandish rhyming of ""Anglish"" and ""Language."" (Iron Ore Betty)Crazy, smart, relate-able, cartoon-y stuff. Prine is as good as Waits, as good as Dylan, as good as Elvis Costello. First buy ""John Prine,"" then buy ""Bruised Orange.""  They're both American classics. Bruised Orange, released in the late 70's, snuck up on me quietly. As an  undergrad at the University of Minnesota, I only bought the record because  of the song title &quot;Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone.&quot; Once I  started listening to it, his sense of humor and amazing ability to capture  the human condition made me a fan for life.Each one of these songs are a  jewel and the stories behind them are certainly worthwhile to learn about  as you learn about one of America's authentic voices. I gave a 5 star rating because it's John Prine. If you are a John Prine fan you will understand, if you're not a fan, well, you should be. this is a great record! its got all of johns sides on it from fun country licks to slow folksy love songs if i had to reccomend one jonh prine album this would be the one.

262,506,B0000005XY,"Parts of this review have been used to review John Prine's ""Great Days"" album which is pound for pound the best compilation around but if you have extra dough get this one as well.Over the last several months I have done more musically-oriented reviews that I had expected. One of the themes that have kept cropping up is that for some folk/blues-oriented musical artists like Bob Dylan my attachment was immediate, long time and on-going. For other artists like John Prine it has been more of a recently acquired taste. In fact, my first acquaintance with the work of John Prine, at least that I was aware of, was several years ago when I was requested to get a couple of his CDs for a friend for Christmas. Upon listening to those albums, including this compilation, we both agreed that the best bet was to return them and get something else. Go figure.I had, obviously, heard Bonnie Raitt do his ""Angel From Montgomery"" long ago but I never associated his name with that song. Then a couple of years ago I happened to listen to his ""Hello In There"" and ""Sam Stone"".  Anyone whose has been affected by the Vietnam War experience in any way will gasp after hearing ""Sam Stone"",  a very personal take of the destructiveness of that war for many of those who fought it, found hard drugs and found the black hole as a result. If you want to hear a real anti-war song rather than something wistful like ""Where have All The Flowers Gone?"" and the like then listen to this one. Yes, this guy has something to say that I wanted to (and on some songs, needed to) hear.This compilation represents a nice selction of his later work. Mr. Prine is a good guitar player, a very, very good wordsmith who has produced some poetic turns of phrases here that will have you thinking for a while. He also frankly, has the wry sense of humor (in the classical Greek sense of that word) of a man who has been pushed around by life, has pushed back; taken his beatings, dusted himself off and gotten back up again. You know, just the kind of guy that I, and I am sure other guys and gals of a certain age, very definitely can relate to.So what is good here? Listen to ""The Sins Of Memphisto"", ""Picture Show"" Train"" and ""Jessus The Missing Years"". The you will know what I mean by that remark about his wordsmanship mentioned above. John Prine hit his creative peak with &quot;The Missing Years.&quot;  There are so many fine songs, it is hard to choose a favorite.  Prine has never been in better voice and his normally creative folk songwriting is particularly witty here.  The verbal workout &quot;The Sins of  Memphisto,&quot; the playful &quot;Daddy's Little Pumpkin,&quot; and the  rockin' &quot;Take a Look at My Heart&quot; are among the best tracks.  This is simply one of the best examples of folk rock available. I am listening to John Prine's CD `The Missing Years' while waiting for my brown rice spinach pilaf to cook for lunch, Tuesday, March 6, 2007. The words of the songs are printed inside the CD case, but you won't get that from me. I have printed words and chords for entire John Prine albums from the internet, with three or four songs per page. There are plenty of words in a song like `It's A Big Old Goofy World,' but it has been years since I tried to memorize the words so I could sing a song the way it would be performed. Now I'm more impressed by words that jump out at me, like the lines in `The Sins of Memphisto':Sally used to play with her hula hoopsNow she tells her problems to therapy groupsGrampa's on the front lawn staring at a rakewondering if his marriage was a terrible mistakeI'm sitting on the front steps drinking Orange CrushWondering if it's possible for me to still blushUH HUH OH YEAH.I have plenty of favorite people playing on this CD: David Lindley, Howie Epstein, Benmont Tench, and Mike Campbell. Four of the names for the people singing background vocals are well known. `Jesus the Missing Years' is the song which shows the greatest imagination, but `Daddy's Little Pumpkin' has the most ""fire burning, burning right behind your eyes"" kind of sense. There is a great blues song on this CD, `Great Rain' written by John Prine and Mike Campbell, which is something I never expected from John Prine, which has enough greatness to easily picture:I thought I heard you calling my nameI was standing by the rivertalking to a young Mark Twain. This was a comeback album for John and in my opinion, it's his best ever, and boy oh boy,(no pun intended) that's saying plenty. This guy's responsible for my switch in music genre's some years ago with his early stuff. I never thought he'd top his classic self- titled and ""Bruised Orange"" releases, but he did it. The smartest storyteller around. Thanks John, ""you got gold"" inside of you. Another excellent collection of John Prine! I mean really, come on, have you ever heard a bad John Prine album/cd? Old school John Prine with lots of blasts from the past, I bought this for a few of the tunes I was working on myself. Outstanding.  Ten of the 14 songs are excellent.  Four are very good.  There isn't a bad song in the whole CD.  Prine has a unique way of singing about the little world.  You can understand every word.  He is definitely not your typical top 40 guy nor does he want to be.  For people who don't know his music, he is a well kept secret.  It's my favorite CD. Not a weak track on this album. Prine's humor and crack songwriting skills, along with his always pleasing vocal and guitar skills, make this one another winner. John Prine is a national treasure! The songs by John Prine alone are wonderful.  The songs where he shares writing credits are not, IMHO, as good.  A few are throwaways.  I am not really interested in a ""John Prine and the Heartbreakers"" album.  The Tom Petty sound is there (which is somewhat formulaic) but without the clever lyrics, humor, intelligence and heart that make up the best John Prine songs, well it leaves me a little disappointed, just like the headline says.  Almost gave it 3 stars, but the JP songs are stand-outs, so I will leave it at 4. Big Prine fan. I've always enjoyed his music. John is a great story teller. I would recommend this album to any Prine fan A mood-raiser, a facilitator for deep thinking, and a spiritual guidebook. The mailman delivers again.Thank you for all of your lessons. If CDs had grooves I'd have worn this one out 20 times.  John is the  writer, or co-writer, on 13 of the 14 songs here, and his writing has never  been more poignant, subtle, or reflective.  A fine blend of bluesy  folk-rock, mildly sad and nostalgic, yet there's an undercurrent of joy  &amp; humor, suggesting the confidence of a survivor who thoroughly enjoys  life.  This record sounds like a long lost friend who's come back to share  his stories--and, with the likes of David Lindley, Albert Lee, Mike  Campbell, Benmont Tench, Tom Petty, Phil Everly, Bonnie Raitt, and Bruce  Springsteen paying their respects--the music  transcends Prine's previous  records.  A warm, family-reunion like aura permeates the sound, and it's  hard for me to imagine a better John Prine album, enjoyable over and over  again, one of my must-have CDs. If it isn't a required course, switch majors Ever get in a rut where you don't know what to listen to?  I can always find my way back to my music roots listening to this CD.  Every song is magical and makes you feel like you're sitting there next to John while he tells stories.  Don't miss this one.  It is a must have. John Prine is one of my favorite artists. This album highlights his talent very well. It's been good to visit with him again. My fiance and I have been ordering and listening to John for some time and this collection is one of his best.  We went to a concert of John Prine's in Des Moines, IA and these are some of what he performed then. I bought this for one particular song which is great and it does have others I like. Service was great,no problems. Had never heard this release. Ordered after seeing John on Colbert.  The guy ranks up there with Dylan (not Thomas) This is by far the best album i have heard by John Prine. i enjoyed the entire album. Okay, all but one song.But that is pretty darn good! This is John's best album, and that's saying a lot. All the other reviewers here are right. The only thing I would add would be a nod to the late Howie Epstein who produced this wonderful stuff (and ""Lost Dogs"" as well)........ John Prine is one of those rare singer/songwriters whose literate work is more popular with fellow artists than with the listening public (Phil Everly, Tom Petty, Bonnie Raitt, and Bruce Springsteen show up to do background vocals on this album).  Prine's work started with acoustic folk and then headed off in the direction of country, but the common denominator remains his quotable lyrics (e.g., ""Unlonely"")  and his wry comic take on the world in which we live (e.g., ""Daddy's Little Pumpkin"").  Even when Prince gets a bit caustic, as with &quot;All the Best,&quot; it is still a treat, but &quot;It's a Big Old Goofy World&quot; with all its clich&eacute;s is more to my liking.  Other songs, such as &quot;Way Back Then&quot; and &quot;Everything is Cool&quot;, provide the emotional revelation that is Prine's true hallmark.  &quot;The Missing Years&quot; is one of Prine's best albums (1991 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album), a shade short of his first self-title work but as good as &quot;Sweet Revenge,&quot; &quot;Bruised Orange,&quot; and the more recent &quot;In Spite of Ourselves.&quot;  Of course, Prine had a built in advantage with &quot;The Missing Years&quot; because it had been about five years since his previous album and the result was, as you would suspect, a stronger body of work. Loved him before and this album did not let me down! We even played songs from this album at our wedding. Loved it! This is the only John Prine album I've ever really listened to, but it's a good testament to his abilities as a songwriter and musician, and a good advertisement to make a person want to hear his other work.""The Sins of Memphisto"" is a terrific, upbeat song about growing old and gaining regrets.""Unlonely"" and ""You Got Gold"" are happy, hopeful, beautiful love songs.And ""All the Best"" is a slightly bitter well-wishing to an old flame, and may be the album's best track.""I wish you loveAnd happiness.I guess I wishYou all the best.I wish you don'tDo like I doAnd ever fall in loveWith someone like you.""All of the songs tell stories (though some are cryptic), and almost all of them are good.  Some I could take or leave.  Overall though, this is a good collection of songs, and John Prine's voice and the songs and arrangements are all very worth listening to, and all worth getting to know. Even though it was first released 20 years ago it still seems fresh and timeless. Will be playing this over and over again. This is one of my favorite Prine releases, the other being Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings. If you are a long time Prine fan, this is a very nice additon to your collection, if you are new to JP, it is a nice place to start. The best cuts in my opinion are:Picture ShowSins of MemphistoEverybody Feels Like YouUnlonelyTake a Look at My HeartThe other cuts are ok, however I am not as taken with them as I am with the ones listed.Sins of Memphisto has to be one of my favs, the lyrics are nonsensical and thats what makes the song what it is. Kind of like American Pie, you keep listening, trying to figure out something that can't be figured out.You won't be dissapointed. John Prine goodness.  Always a good storyteller.  One of my husband's favorite singer/songwriter.  Good album and full of good music. One of the best records ever made Love John Prine. About 18 years ago a gf turned me on to him. Saw him in concert and was hooked. This is my favorite album of his. A wonderful blend of goofy and thoughtful.  It has stood the test of time and I love it for the long drives in the car when there is room in my head for meandering thoughts.  Prine's music can point the way for the wanderer! Saw him promote this album on The Colbert Report and had to have it.  Love it, but it's not for the feeble minded, train your brain before listening! I can't get enough John Prine! He is one of the best lyricist ever. No disappointments on this album at all. John and his music are ageless. Truely a master of his craft and the performing talent never fades. I have most of his recordngs and this just added to all tht I still have on vinyl. This is one fantastic recording! A must-have for any J.P. fan or lover of great folk music. God Bless you John and thanks for all the good times!!! Very different and more polished production work on this very good effort from one of my favorite songwriters.  Prine allows for more instrumentation in some of the tunes, and almost reminds me of when Dylan went &#34;electric&#34; in some of the songs...very good work from this writer who MUST be inducted into the Writer's Hall NOW!!","Folk Rock,Contemporary Folk,Country,Pop,Traditional Folk,Singer-Songwriters,Rock,Folk",parts review used review john prines great days pound pound best compilation around extra dough get one well last several months done musically oriented reviews expected one themes kept cropping folk blues oriented musical artists like bob dylan attachment immediate long time going artists like john prine recently acquired taste fact first acquaintance work john prine least aware several years ago requested get couple cds friend christmas upon listening including compilation agreed best bet return get something else go figure obviously heard bonnie raitt angel montgomery long ago never associated name couple years ago happened parts review used review john great days pound pound best compilation extra dough months musically oriented reviews expected themes kept cropping folk folk blues blues oriented musical musical artists artists bob bob dylan attachment immediate long long time time artists john prine recently acquired acquired taste taste fact acquaintance work john aware years years ago requested couple cds friend listening including compilation agreed best bet return go figure figure obviously heard bonnie bonnie raitt raitt angel long long ago associated couple years years ago happened
263,507,B0000005Y0,"A typical John Prine vehicle.... complete with Christmas photos of the past! Gave this as a retirement gift to a John Prine fan.  i was glad to find this CD.  Received it promptly As much as I love John Prine, this one is for completists only: live versions of a few originals and a couple of holiday tunes. Short, too: EP length First let me say -  we love JP.  We purchase one Christmas cd per season.  This year we chose John's.  However, it's just not enough Christmas for us.  Would return it if possible. OK, so at least one song has nothing to do with Christmas (""If You Were the Woman and I Was the Man), although it's a beautiful song.  And in one, he mentions Christmas in the intro only (""All the Best"").  And one mentions Christmas in the song, but is arguably not a Christmas song (""Everything is Cool"").  And there are only eight total tracks on the whole thing.  But this is taking it's place very close to ""Phil Spector's Christmas Album"" as my all-time favorite.John Prine is also very close to Bob Dylan in my eyes for title of all-time best songwriter.  His quirky use of making us look at the meanings of words a little differently has always mesmerized me.  A good example is in the best original Christmas song here ""Silent Night All Day Long"".  Just looking at the title is a good example of this.  It is the closing line of a very moving chorus of a song that would be a modern classic if radio programmers had any sense.He also throws in a few traditional songs, ""Silver Bells"" and ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"", the latter being done with a rollicking saloon piano in the background.  Of course we get his immortal ""Chrismas in Prison"", and who thought THAT song would ever appear on a Christmas album?  The closing monologue is touching, and has a surprise ending that, once again, may not be traditionally Christmas, but somehow fits and leaves you with a good feeling.This album gets more likeable each time you listen to it. What a nice change to &#34;traditional holiday music&#34; I loved that he has included such artists as the famous &#34;Cowboy Junkies&#34;. Highly recommend this! ""A John Prine Chirstmas"" . . .  yes, it IS a Christmas album . . . but yes, i listen to this album ""year 'round"".  It is classic John Prine, and the seasonal holiday leaning of it's themes in no way stand in the way of all year listening and enjoyment of these great songs and great ""Prine performances"".From the very first note of the very first track, ""Everything Is Cool"" . . . you just know that for the duration of this album's play, everything IS cool. (and it is one of the best songs John Prine has ever written at that.)""All The Best"" is a slightly comic look at a ""broken relationship"" and wishing the other ""all the best"" nonetheless. One can't picture John Prine with any other ciew on life, even when life doesn't go the way we'd have liked it to go.""Silent Night All Day long"" is a christmas card in music and lyric . . . it just paints a beautiful nostalgic holiday card picture of two lovers memories of christmas together. a little melancholy, a little tinge of sadness of the past, and a lot of beauty - another og John's best.""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Clause"" will just break you up in a smile and then into outright laughter -- ""i saw mommy kissing Santa Clause . . .ON THE LIPS!"" John laughs in mock shock!""Christmas In Prison"" is a live version of an early John Prine song. It describes the isolation and loneliness of celebrating Christmas for those locked behind prison walls and bars. Like the late great Johnny Cash, John Prine seems to catch hold of a glimpse of a soul's thoughts and feelings in such isolated circumstances. This is a truly great song by john Prine.John Ends this Christmas tour de force with a story of ""A John Prine Christmas"" . . . suffice it to say that he concludes this account with an acordion solo of ""The Lichtenstein Polka""!  ha! . . . a tribute to his childhood memories of Christmases past no doubt.Even if you don't have the ""Christmas Spirit"", get this album . . you'll love it . .and enjoy it all through the year . . and it WILL be Christmas All Year Long!Thank you John Prine for all the great songs and smiles you have brought to us . . and we always look forward to many more . . .  and this ""A John Prine Christmas"" cd will bring me smiles for a long long time to come.  :) I've struggled with this critical citation much longer than most, over the last few months this disc has turned thru at least a couple dozen times, and I'm still on the fence for words. I suppose the artist shared simular sensations while songsmithing his seasonal sleigh ride, a unquie sincerity is reflected throughout. I suppose EVERYTHING IS COOL,in this small package there's  instru-tinsel, YULEridGEMality, liveness, curious narration & banter, twists-n-tweaks,and merry-medley maneuvering.~~~Merrily Mix~~~ 1$1\2, 2$, 3#1\2, 6#1\2, 7#, and 8#1\2 ~~~Post Script: If the artist is new to you, seek YULEtide elsewhere first. Yet if you're fondly familar, take the purchase plunge and click this disc into the chart, hey man it's Christmas and its' From John To you. ***buyit,saveit*sharemost*givetofans*** YULEridGEMality Factor = 5 1\2 I recently saw John Prine in a small club in Berlin Germany with Todd Schneider opening up. It had been years since the last time I saw him and never had had the good fortune to see him in such a small setting. He is one of the few great American song writers. You know one of those who writes songs that you really have to listen to, to appreciate. Then there is the musicianship. No synthesizers, scratching records, light shows, or other gimmicks, just good music that takes you back to the America of the 50's, 60's, 70's..... and wherever else he wants to take you. After seeing his performance in this small club with two other backing musicians, I am not surprised to hear someone use the adjective &quot;rockin&quot; in connection with John Prine. If you've never seen him or heard him you're really missing something. I can only say, I hope to see him in Quasimodo again real soon, because like a good bottle of wine, John Prine keeps getting better with age. It's not Christmas without John Prine's Christmas Album playing.  This is one of his best, and it is hard to find.

264,512,B000000623,"Compilations serve several purposes for me. I get a chance to hear various artists and decide who I like and eventually seek out a CD by the artist. I've had this CD since it's original release, 1990, and still enjoy it. For what it is worth, this is a variety of bands, all playing their own distinct styles of flamenco. The only groove that is constant is the flamenco guitar. The CD is an indicator of the push flamenco has taken in an attempt to have &quot;rock&quot; appeal for the global audience. While some non Spanish musicians are bringing elements of flamenco into their sound Spanish artists were busy branching out from their roots. The results for the featured Spanish artists is at times exciting yet uninspiring yet all the while fresh. I'm just not sure what is wrong with pure flamenco. The variety explored on this CD is worth a listen but hardly anything will make your hair stand up on your arms. Anyone who loves flamenco will like this compilation and quite possibly discover a &quot;new&quot; artist. For me it was Pepe Habichuela and his wonderful guitar, &quot;Ketama&quot; and their excursions into other genres, &quot;Pata Negra&quot; and their fusion that doesn't drift too far away. Most of the music on this sampler is very good but not excellent very often. A beautiful Spanish guitar, played from someone from Iberia is just without question a delight for the ears. I cannot get enough Spanish guitar and the variety here is worthwhile. New directions prior to the new mileniumn. These modern band of gypsy's are extensions of our global community. Where will it all end up? I hope they stay close to their roots.  Some younster is probably playing guitar in Spain right now with the answer.","Europe,Contemporary Folk,Latin Pop,Latin Music,Pop,World Music,Flamenco,Spain,Continental Europe,Folk",compilations serve several purposes get chance hear various artists decide like eventually seek cd artist ive cd since original release still enjoy worth variety bands playing distinct styles flamenco groove constant flamenco guitar cd indicator push flamenco taken attempt quot rock quot appeal global audience non spanish musicians bringing elements flamenco sound spanish artists busy branching roots results featured spanish artists times exciting yet uninspiring yet fresh im sure wrong pure flamenco variety explored cd worth listen hardly anything make hair stand arms anyone loves flamenco like compilation quite possibly discover quot new quot artist fo compilations serve purposes chance hear various artists artists decide eventually seek cd artist ive cd original release enjoy worth variety bands playing distinct styles groove constant flamenco flamenco guitar guitar cd indicator push flamenco attempt quot rock quot appeal global audience spanish musicians bringing elements sound spanish artists busy branching roots results featured spanish artists times exciting uninspiring fresh sure wrong pure flamenco variety explored cd worth listen hardly hair stand arms loves flamenco compilation quite possibly discover new artist fo
265,514,B000000628,"I own most of Ali Farka Toure's recordings, but this was the first one I bought and, to my mind, still the best.  This recording shows how the relationship between African and American music has been bi-directional.  The (American) blues stems from African music, but it (as well as American  jazz and Latino music) has also sent its influence the other way.  You can  hear a lot of this cross-fertilization in Ali Farka's music, together with  Arab influences.But what does it sound like?  Robert Johnson of the  Niger?  Son House of the Sahel? The guitar playing is clear, penetrating  and soulful, the accompaniment is spare, clean and rythmic and the singing  is haunting and sublime.  In addition to being a great guitarist, Ali Farka  is a superb singer. Unless you speak Bambara, you can't understand it,  apart from the occasional French bits, but that hardly matters.  When you  listen to Maria Callas singing La Boheme, you can't understand the words,  but the meaning and the feeling come through loud and clear.  Ali Farka's  singing has the same effect.Buy this record! Ali Farka Toure: The SourceThere are guitarists aplenty in this world.  There are virtuoso musicians from Africa aplenty as well, but none have captured the soul of his culrure in a world in which we can traverse the entire globe in just over a day like Mr. Toure.  There have been few musicians like Ali Farka Toure.  One listen to his signatire, twanging picking of the strings of his guitar and you will forever know him as soon as you hear him.This album, The Source, is a wonderful collection of songs from his repertoire and takes the listener through an absolute garden of musical fragrances, all nurtured by the deep, rich soil of the history of the African peoples.  Al of this is then filtered through the genius of one of the world's premiere musicians.Monsieur Toure, who left us in March of 2006 wasn't the best or flashiest guitarists to have his music published, but he was alsways one of the most sincere.  His style is distinctive.  The world lost something special when he died, and I think this album shows his gifts of story telling and musical awareness in a most excellent fashion. Aside perhaps from the necessary hype to introduce a Malian musician to Western listeners who don't know where or what Mali is, I don't hear much similarity to American blues music in this Ali Farka Toure release. Except maybe the pentatonic scale, but that's used in Japanese and other musics too. And certainly the comparison to John Lee Hooker is bizarre. In this album, Mr. Toure exhibits some serious guitar chops across a wide swath of tempos, rhythms and styles. Most important, his seemingly effortless yet complex guitar playing is employed over beautiful compositions, vocal melodies, percussion and singing. The first track, ""Goye Kur"" is a tour de force with ringing, fluid chorused guitar, a bright bold vocal chant and melody, rumbling and precise calabash percussion and a haunting njarka line that anchors the whole shebang. Hawa Dolo reminds me weirdly of Ben E. King and the Drifters doing a solemn, yet hopeful prayer song. The solo instrumental, Cinquante Six, has a nice Chet Atkins vibe with its delicate and nimble fingerpicking. Excellent recording, mixing and production top it all off. Given the success of Talking Timbuktu, it seemed a good choice to team Ali Farka Toure with Taj Mahal, but unfortunately there is very little spark in this recording, with Ali Farka Toure left to carry the load as Taj Mahal seems hopelessly out of step with the music.  It was the last album Ali Farka Toure did with American musicians.  I suppose it was more a studio choice than it was a personal choice, as Ali Farka Toure long dreamed of playing with John Lee Hooker, which would have been an ideal pairing, but such opportunities are often missed.  One is much better served getting Talking Timbuktu or Ali Farka Toure's earlier recordings before he became an international figure. Years ago, I listened to the cassette of this as I drove through the great southwest. The scenery was magnificent and listening to Farka Toure only heightened the experience. He was a true master of the medium. I Became Aware Of Ali Farka Toure a few years back&amp; I was Vibing Instantly.You Feel The Blues.The Music Connects From Africa toAmerica.it's History&amp;a Reflection of Our Worlds.The Music Reflects The  Struggle&amp;The Tones are THe Voices OF Unity.His Genius Brings Many  Worlds TOgether.Very Essential&amp;Full Of Life. Yep! you'll like it. This is good stuff, maybe a little bit repetitive if you had to make a comment, but I liked it all the way. Easy to approach, easy to like and enduring. I had heard about Ali Toure` and his virtuoso guitar work-it's not hype; the man can PLAY. &quot;The Source&quot;, is a fantastic CD, and I can hardly wait to buy more of his CD's. He is living proof that you don't have to be from the Mississippi Delta to be a great Blues guitarist and to play with feeling. In response to the last review, this CD (1991) was cut before talking timbuktu (1994), and to my ears is in fact a much better record. Toure is with his own band here, with the celeb's just making token background appearences on a few tracks. The Ry Cooder session sounds like it is under a coat of post-production varnish, where as this record's sound is much more immediate and fresh.Of Toure's ""electric"" discs in wide release, I think this is the most satisfying listen from start to finish, without the production overpowering the music, which is compelling even unaccompanied (such as on Radio Mali.)Talking Timbuktu achieved its goal of making Toure a star in the west, but his other albums, which are not ""crossover"" records, are far more rewarding... This Album is SO wonderful to listen to. Just beautiful sound rining, bouncing... it is hard to put to words. But this CD has some really wonderful sound. A pleasure to have playing while cooking a good meal with a friend, or just quitely kicking back after a long day. Restorative and takes you to a nice place. I prefer this Farka Toure to &quot;Talking Timbuktu &quot; (with Ry Cooder). Each of the songs here has more draw for me then those assembled on Talking Timbuktu . The mood ranges from bouncy to swinging to brooding to mournful.My favorite song &quot;Hawa Dolo&quot; is a haunting almost lullaby-like work without chorus or other accompaniment. I don't know what the song is about but it makes my heart stop. He is the man. Refreshing music. True heat and true feelings.  No show neccesssary -  just the pure guitar sound from Mali. There, great guitarists are born and trained since decades. The &quot;Super Rail Band of Bamako&quot; is a living proof since over 30 years.&quot;The Source&quot; is a great start for anybody to get to know Toure beyond his collobarartion with Ry Cooder and a must for all, who know him. What a gem. In the trancelike guitar lines you can almost hear the seeds of the blues, musical ideas that would travel from West Africa to the Southern U.S. and change music history. Ali Farka Toure takes us back to  the source. Beautiful.","Rock,Jazz,Africa,Pop,World Music,Mali",ali farka toures recordings first one bought mind still best recording shows relationship african american bi directional american blues stems african well american jazz latino also sent influence way hear lot cross fertilization ali farkas together arab influences sound like robert johnson niger son house sahel guitar playing clear penetrating soulful accompaniment spare clean rythmic singing haunting sublime addition great guitarist ali farka superb singer unless speak bambara cant understand apart occasional french bits hardly matters listen maria callas singing la boheme cant understand words meaning feeling come loud clear ali farkas singing th ali farka toures toures recordings bought mind best recording shows relationship african american bi directional american american blues blues stems american jazz latino sent influence way hear lot cross fertilization arab influences sound robert robert johnson johnson son son house house sahel guitar playing clear penetrating soulful accompaniment spare clean singing haunting sublime addition great guitarist superb singer speak bambara understand apart occasional french bits hardly matters listen maria callas callas singing la boheme boheme understand words meaning feeling come loud clear singing
266,515,B00000062H,"Awesome sound. So mellow yet imspirational.  Music to soothe your soul and tickle your fancy. Track number 9 is my favorite. A great example of the best of &#34;world music.&#34; Both the African roots and Ry Cooder's virtuousity come through. Strong themes but lots of diversity. love this album. i heard his music while visiting San Francisco and just fell in love. There is something so sexual about this album. I love it. Especially Ai Du and Diaraby. It's eerily amazing how musicians continents away can produce similar music. Many of the songs have long preludes before the vocals come in and I found myself almost wanting the cd to be instrumental, the rhythm is so awesome. Ry Cooder meshes well with Ali Toure and his ensemble being sure not to overpower the traditional tune, but nevertheless his sound is not lost in the mix. I bought the CD for Ai Du featured in movie Unfaithful but ended up liking many others with that similar groove. This cd is a risk for listeners not open to stretching their concept of the blues due to it's repetitious Malian vocals. In my opinion it's a risk worth taking. I loved this CD. I was unfamiliar with the artist, Ali Farka Toure, hearing only clips from one of the pieces on a NPR program. The guitar playing is masterful, the songs are melodious. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants to listen to soemthing a little different from the mainstream.Cindi I bought this CD at the same time as the one named Ali Farka Toure because I couldn't decide between the two. It is a good combination. The other album is acoustic and a small number of musicians and types of instruments. Here the guitars are electric as well as acoustic, and there is a type of flute and more drums and other Malian instruments.  The bluesy element is more apparent on some numbers due to Ry Cooder's influence, I suspect, as well as the dragging rhythm similar to that associated with John Lee Hooker, but others are distinctively African. One of the songs, Soukora, was popular even as far away as East Africa, where I heard it often, and is a personal favorite. The songs are very interesting both vocally and rhythmically and the instrumentation is excellent. I saw the movie  UNFAITHFUL with Diane Lane and Richard Gere and from the moment I heard a couple of notes of this music I HAD TO FIND OUT who this was!!!!!  Beautiful music! Love it! I haven't been this pleased with an album in its entirety in a long time. Talking Timbuktu in collaboration with Ry Cooper, definitely connects the music of Africa with the blues music in America. There is a strong connection to blues music and of the Malian music. This is a great CD to listen to. Anyone that is a music enthusiast should get this CD. Listen to it carefully and compare it to Delta blues music. There is that powerful connection that draws the listener to succumb to the guitar and fiddle playing. This is the best CD to come out in 1994. As a classical musician, my personal listening experiences often get limited to a different sphere than the world of this artist.  A friend introduced me to Toure with this album and I'm overwhelmed.  I do not find it merely entertaining. There is an other-worldly, magical quality which shakes me to my musical roots.  It's as if I have seen music as it used to exist many thousands of years ago, now being spoken in the present day in a language that I recognize instantly.This is music reaching beyond the drama of the individual and purely personal emotion, beyond even hope, ambition and certainly fear of any kind.  A friend of mine works on Wall Street and I've recently wondered what would happen if the Ninth Symphony and the B Minor Mass were played during work hours there.  I now earnestly hope that that industry puts down its telephones and looks away from its computers to listen to music from an artist like Toure.  And I wish our fractious America as a whole would listen in as well. I love this cd.  It is rich and sensual.  I first heard part of it on the film ""Unfaithful.""  I will definitely be buying more of this artist. Talking Timbuktu is a conversation between jazz and traditional West African music, likely the grandfather of jazz. Wonderful rhythms, great improvisation and evocative emotional expression. Ry Cooder is one of my favorite roots musicians. With this record, he found the roots of roots music: the ancestral music played in Mali, which came to be called &#34;wild blues&#34; because it was so clearly the ancestor of that music. Blues is of course the root of rock and roll, and hides deep within country and folk as well.Clearly, this pairing of musicians had a magic all its own. This recording has become background music for every creative individual I have played it for: painters, photographers, writers, and of course musicians, who upon first hearing it usually have to go buy a copy for themselves. I chose to acquire one of the long-out-of-print CDs simply to have the source to copy from electronically. It goes onto every computer I own, perpetually.If you have a creative person in your life, they may very well appreciate the gift of this strange, otherworldly, yet somehow intimately familiar music. Find them a sample on YouTube, and see what they think. This is what you are looking for if you are interested in the funky blues music from the Sountrack Unfaithful. This will make you want to dance.  Standouts for me:""Lasidan"" - Gets in your head.  It's possibly my favorite song on the album.  Tour&eacute;'s voice resonates in the mind for days.""Banga"" - Ali Farka Tour&eacute; is incredible here on the njarka.  The combination of this beautiful instrument, the congo, and the calabash is breathtaking.""Diaraby"" - A fitting end.  Lovely.It's an all-around beautiful disc.Side note: If you like this album, you should really check out Ali Farka Tour&eacute;'s son,Vieux Farka Tour&eacute;. I have 6 or 7 CDs of music from Mali and find myself listening to this one most often. While I love them all --- the combination of musicians: Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder is unbeatable. Track #1 ""Bonde"" sung in Peul begins with a fantastic guitar introduction by Ali Farka Toure. Each note is drawn out just right to hook the emotions. The congas played by Oumar Toure provides an infectious rhythm. One male voice begins while a chorus responds in rhythmic unity, telling the story of why some women are unsuitable for marriage. Track #2 ""Soukara"" is sung in the Bambara language ... it has the sound and feeling of music from the Caribbean with a suitable ambient melody. The male vocalist pours his heart out to his lover at night, so say the liner notes. Another favorite track is #5 ""Amandral"" sung in the Temasheck language. The rhythms and sounds of this desert tribe is familiar. They are unforgetable on the CDs ""Festival in the Desert"" and ""Radio Tisdas Sessions"" both of which are highly recommended. As each guitar note is plucked, the feelings of the listener are hooked. The feelings rise ... ever higher in resonance with the melody and mood expressed on the slide, acoustic and bass guitars, drums, calabash, and congas.Without exaggerating, I feel this CD contains some of the finest guitar playing on the planet. Other favorites are: #6, ""Lasidan"" (#6) which has a peppy, cheerful and upbeat tempo and #7, ""Keito"", which has musical elements of India and Pakistan or is it the Meditarranean? Ry Cooder plays the tamboura, Ali Farka Toure plucks and strums the electric guitar. There is a syncopated rhythm played on the congas and calabash. The music of Mali is highly distinct and very appealing. It is the best music from Northern Africa, and to this listener, the best from the whole continent of Africa. Erika Borsos (erikab93) Glad I bought this CD. It was my first exposure to Ali Farka Toure, but my experience with Ry  gave me the confidence to explore new ground. Good move. I have spent enough time in good faith effort of listening to Ry Cooder to come to the conclusion that I cannot understand his appeal.I do applaud his taste.  The Buena Vista Social Club is an excellent project that has brought wonderful music to a great many people, and who would argue with the greatness of Ali Farka Toure?  However, when Cooder picks up his ax and starts to play along, what he produces is so uninteresting musically, in fact has so little musical content, that he adds a blunted edge to the whole.  Cooder is essentially a colorist, which may be effective in film scores that carry a sentimental attachment for listeners, but when the idea is just music and listening, he's like a black hole suck out all the interest.This CD is a case in point.  Toure was a great musician, every note he played inherently interesting, musical and soulful.  Yet put him in the room with Cooder, and the result is every track is static, navel-gazing, monotonous.  A terrible waste of talent and money, although if you're looking for slightly exotic aural wallpaper, this will do nicely.  Not a good choice for fans of Toure or those exploring his work. I am in love with music from Mali.  It is music that touches the soul.  The region have deep traditions...Then when you understand the lyrics....then you say God has really blessed them with wisdom.  The region has over 700 000 manuscripts and old universities where people from all over came to study in Timbuktu, Djenne...you can find more information on the web at [...] Bought it for a single song - Ai Du - which is fantastic.  Rest are mediocre, but it it a good CD for collectors Probably the most satisfying CD of Ali Farka Toure.  Ry Cooder has assembled an excellent cast of musicians to back him, including the immortal Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown on violin.  The songs are hauntingly beautiful, echoing the Blues, but indebted more to the pervasive Muslim inflence in West Africa.  Toure is one of the grand masters of Malian music, which has an incredibly rich heritage.  He is a purist at heart and this music reflects that approach, although it has been jazzed up to reach a broader audience.  &quot;Soukora&quot; and &quot;Ai Du&quot; will leave you breathless.One only wishes that Toure had the chance to meet John Lee Hooker, since the two seem like soulmates.  When he heard Hooker, Toure apparently was so stunned that he said Hooker belongs in Africa.  It just goes to show you that the Blues is firmly embedded in the African tradition. I wanted the song Ai Du that was in the movie Unfaithful. I bought the Unfaithful soundtrack. The song was not on the soundtrack. After much research online I found the song Ai Du, which is on Talking Timbuktu. I listened to the entire CD and fell in love with it. It is the origin of Blues at its absolute best. The guitar riffs are astounding. The rythms are infectious. With an excellent group of guest appearances from the likes of Ry Cooder, John Patitucci and Gatemouth Brown, this collection of songs showcase Ali Farka Toure's talent and depth. Although I do not speak or understand any of the languages (and Toure can sing in 11 different tongues), the music itself establishes the emotional foundation that allows Toure's voice to evoke the listeners empathy. The album contains the hypnotic repeating figures of African folk music as well as seminal Delta blues. Well worth the price. This was played in a movie starring Richard Gere (Unfaithful) and I brought the cd specificly for this song and it wasn't on it. Thanks to UTube I was able to hear it and thanks to Amazon I was able to purchase and add to my cd repeitore. Love you AMAZON!!! This is a great album for any fan of strings and rhythms. I need better audio equipment to better get the gist of them. The Toure family was a great find for me and Ry Cooder has been a fave for years. Ali Farka Toure was one of the greatest guitarists to come out of Africa, which is quite an achievement, given all of the talent there. His Mali blues sound was as soulful as any of the American blues masters.I would disagree with other reviewers who insist that Cooder has somehow watered down the music - there's great interplay between these two, and having seen Toure on a few occasions in the 90s, I'd have to say that the album did capture his sound at that point in time.Sadly, Ali Farka Toure passed away a few months ago (March 2006).  His presence will be missed. I bought this after seeing the film (Unfaithful) in which it figured....an excellent album of african/blues music...very happy with my choice This is really good music. A combination of blues, African, something I cannot put a description to. Each person has to experience this to see what it means to him (her). I initially purchased this CD for the song 'Ai Du"" from the movie ""Unfaithful""...As luck would have it, if you like that song, the rest of the CD is even better.  Catchy blues tunes such as that on track 5, that remind you of Chicago R&B, mixed with a New Orleans southern blues style of sound and vocals.  This CD is an enjoyable, relaxing mix of sound and takes the listener into the souls of the musicians.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants to have a little change of pace in sound from the norm of every day radio with it's top 40 pounding out the same sound over and over. Along with &#34;Savanne&#34; this is outstandingly good.  I am grateful to have the opportunity to hear this music, and I do understand how it is connected to American blues. I recently purchased Talking Timbuktu and I love it. It was my first purchase by this artist. I'm sad that Mr. Toure passed away recently in his country. I bought this CD because of Ry Cooder. I've loved his music since first hearing on the soundtrack for ""Paris Texas."" I'm also very much into indigenous and ethnic music and am happy to have discovered Ali Farka Toure in this CD. Sometimes slow, sensual, hypnotic, and bluesy like the songs Amandria (my favorite) and Ai Du, and sometimes more rhythmic with a strong beat that you want to get up and dance to, the music on this CD grabs you every which way. Ali Farka Toure's rich voice also adds another dimension to the quality of this CD, on top of the music itself. And every song is top notch. It's rare for me to like every song on a CD, but I love every song. It doesn't disappoint on any level. I first heard the track Ai Du while watching the movie Unfaithful. When I heard this song, I immediately went on a wild search looking for this music. It was like my soul yearned to hear it again. Needless to say, this song is my favorite part of the movie. The entire CD has a senusal, raw jazz/blues feel to it. Highly recommended. A stunning collaboration hihglighting Ali Farka Toure's uncanny ability to evoke deep southern blues and Ry Cooder's equallly uncanny ability to blend traditional music with his own jazz and blues sensibilty (as well as that  of guests such as bassist John Patatucci and Clarence Gatemouth Brown)in a  respectful and successful way.  This album will appeal to many people  including fans of Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder as well as anyone who  appreciates blues.  This is contemplative music that can really set a mood;  gentle and deeply funky all at the same time. This CD is just fabulous and everyone who hears it wants a copy.  Very sophisticated yet original music,soothing and exciting sound. Ry Cooder's importance is mainly in bringing great &quot;local&quot; talents from all over the world to the attention of the wide public. When it comes to music, I am afraid that his contribution is much weaker.  Toure's greatness lies in his driving guitar rhythems and powerful vocals. On this CD both qualities are not fully expressed, probably as a result of the cooperation with Cooder, who is not as deep a performer. I would like to see Toure record with people of his own calibre, whether from Africa or from America. This CD is the only weak CD made by Toure - I recommend &quot;the River&quot;, &quot;The Source&quot; and &quot;Niafunke&quot; before this one. My second favorite african CD, after Bajourou's &quot;Big String Theory&quot; este cd es una verdadera joya musical. No es un cd de musica africana tradicional. La union de cooder con toure brinda momentos de gran altura musical, con una suave cadencia ritmica que se asemeja mucho al mejor blues americano. Para mi uno de los mejores cd de la llamada world music I have given this disc as a gift more times than any other. The music is relaxed, easy to listen to, and combines the brilliance of two incredible guitarists in a melodious blend that I've never heard matched anywhere else. I have quite a lot of West African music and this is different somehow, but is still distinctly more African than American, I think. If there's a disc to take a chance on, this is it - I think anyone that appreciates good blues, acoustic, or African music will like it. It was because of this disc that I've bought nearly every other Ali Farka Toure release, but this one is still my favorite, though it's more polished than others. This is an awesome cd.  High quality, economically priced, and was shipped as stated when purchased.  I wouldn't hesitate to place future orders based on this one. This CD is the result of a great collaboration between two very talented but different musicians. Ry Cooder and Ali Farka Toure. Toure plays in a rhythmic blues influenced style that is evocative of John Lee Hooker and  Lighnin Hopkins. The music here is contemporary yet distinctly African.  Cooder and Toure are supported by a great group of session musicians here  including jazz bassist John Patitucci and guitarist Clarence 'Gatemouth'  Brown.  This recording is ideal for anyone interested in African music from  a blues perspective. As a fan of the Tuareg group ""Tinariwen', I couldn't resist buying this CD when I saw that another famous native of their region hooked up with Ry Cooder. If you've ever listened to Ry's soundtrack works or his wonderful stuff on 'A Meeting by the River' or ""The Buena Vista Social Club' then you'll know why he is such a great match for a veteran like Mr. Toure. Ry's son , Joachim, is a good addition with his drum work too!Both of these men share a love of guitar music and it  shows in every track of this CD. Similar to the effect generated with listening to 'Tinariwen', Talking Timbuktu transports me to the barren- but beautiful- expanses of the Saharan regions. It doesn't matter if its Mali, Niger or Algeria- the effect is the same. If you are familiar with the region, you'll get my meaning. Its haunting and mesemerizing at the same time.This is an absolutely gorgeous CD. It also makes for fantastic 'road music' for when I take road trips. Trust me, its a good companion when the long trails of New Mexico and Arizona beckon and you want music for along the way. BTW- there's a good hour's worth of music here. This is no short trip! ;)Talking Timbuktu definitely TALKS to me! It is not a waste of money at all! I bought this because someone recommended it after I said the only thing I liked about &#34;Wolf of Wall Street&#34; was the chant Matthew McConaughy did before going out and ripping everyone off.  This music is in that genre - you can chant with it, you can match your heartbeat to it and feel &#34;connected&#34; somehow.I guess it's not for everyone - but it's how I respond to this music and maybe you will too. This is primarily a modern cd,a cd to be hear by all the world.This is a great reunion of many streams in the musical view.The voices,the rythms,all of the contents is really result of a great,serious work of that great musicians such Ry Cooder;Ali Farka;Clarence and others.All of the blues lovers knows the great influences of Afro-American rythms,lyrics,etc...in the blues,and this cd is a rare opportunity to be in contact with the bluesman of Mali,and this excelent musician called Ry Cooder,one of the best folk-songster from all the times.The guitar tunes in this cd is pure,the drums echoes with a kind of vibration,difficult to explain.Another refined cd,for those people that loves good music,modern music and all of it's varieties.I really recomend this cd!!!! ""Talking Timbuktu"" is one of those CDs where you have an aha moment.  Oh yes, you have heard this music before and yet, not quite.  Ry Cooder and Ali Farka Toure play beautifully together and truly bring the Mali's music straight to us.  This is an extremely listenable CD and well worth the price. I'm sitting here listening to this Cd while I type.  After hearing a snippet of it in the movie &quot;Unfaithful,&quot; I went on the hunt to find this music. This appeals on so many levels, you can really feel it.  Fabulous! This CD was bought after seeing the film 'Unfaithful' (the 'Unfaithful' soundtrack does not include all music in the film), which included a track by Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder. The rest of the CD is great and I find myself humming the tunes all the time. A fantastic joining of talent. This is Diana Lane and her french lover dancing...  with Ry Cooder...  tops it off.  No one does this like the original here. FANTASTIC !!!  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ALBUM, I LISTEN TO IT FOR HOURS. I got this CD because I liked the song from the movie, ""Unfaithful"". I like a couple of other tunes also..very unique CD..and love the guitar. This is a wonderful record of two masters exploring the breadth of musical language.  Ry Cooder is one of those few great musicians who, although he has chops that won't quit, submerges his ego and technique in the service of the song.  Hearing Ry and Ali Farka Toure together is a treat.Pay no attention to the couple of reviewers who speak poorly of Cooder's playing.  Uninteresting musically?  Weak contribution?  Not as deep a performer? Huh? Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, but in the interest of full disclosure, these folks just don't know what they're talking about. I first heard a cut from this album in the film &#34;Unfaithful&#34; with Diane Lane and Richard Gere.  The song itself and Ali Farka Toure combined with Ry Cooder is just &#34;close your eyes and sit back&#34; to listen.  So sultry and sensual The liner notes tell us that Toure speaks eleven languages and that on this album he sings in Songhai, Bambara, Peul and Tamasheck. And do you know what? It doesn't matter that I don't understand the words. Music is a universal language and the music on this disc is gorgeous! I first bought this album because Ry Cooder is one of the best guitarists on the planet. I've now added Ali Farka Toure to that list. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I was watching the movie Unfaithful and heard the song AI Du, After the movie ended I went on line to try and purchase the sound track however, this song was not on the sound track. I researched on line and found the disc. the music on this cd is absolutely great. I have a couple of Ry Cooder albums.  If you like his music, this is a good addition to your collection. Ry Cooder's interest in ethnic folk music from the developing world is well known; his most celebrated project to date was probably bringing `The Buena Vista Social Club' from quiet obscurity in Cuba to a wider global audience.This well-deserved 1995 Grammy winner is a collection of songs by Malian blues/folk musician Ali Farka Toure with his backing musicians Hamma Sankare and Oumar Toure together with Cooder, Clarence Brown, John Patitucci and Jim Keltner. The album was recorded over three days in California in late 1993 during Toure's US tour, and produced by Cooder.Instantly accessible and eminently listenable, `Talking Timbuktu' reveals a deeper side with repeat plays as the complex interplay of these excellent musicians beguiles its way into your soul. All the songs are sung in one or other of the various ethnic languages of Mali with English translations in the insert booklet, so you know what Toure is on about. Some of the numbers are in the groove of Mississippi Delta blues, which reveals where the style originates: West Africa.You can listen to this album all day long wherever you are and whatever you're doing; it's truly music for all seasons. It has an exotic & authentically African flavour, is delightfully upbeat and some of it is wonderfully danceable. Admittedly the result is more Toure than Cooder: the American musicians take a back seat and act as sidemen to Toure and his band, to sublime result. Cooder's attention to detail means that the overall production is near-faultless, with the sound in perfect balance.If you don't know any of the excellent music which has come out of Mali these past 20 years (Salif Keita, Amadou & Mariam, Super Rail Band, Bassekou Kouyate, Fatoumata Diawara) then `Talking Timbuktu' would be a good port of entry and a purchase you're unlikely to regret. I absolutely LOVE this music! I first heard it in the movie ""Unfaithful"" and FINALLY tracked it down and found out the song I wanted wasnt even on the movie soundtrack, it was on another CD. I ordered it and figured I would only listen to that one song----WRONG----I love the entire CD! Its great! I think its called ""African Jazz"", but whatever it is, its sultry, sexy, and I could dance to it all night long. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I enjoy African music and love this CD. One of the songs on this CD is very famous. It's called ""Ai Du"" from the movie ""Unfaithful"". Ry Cooder facilitates the presentation of this catchy and outstanding music from Mali. Ali Farka Tour&eacute; is known in Europe but not much in the US. Ry Cooder brings another great musician to light. Ali Farka Toure is a leading singer-guitarist from Niafunke, Mali and Ry Cooder  has made quite a discovery in this artist. His music is quite good, and very bluesy, though it's a laid back blues. It has been said all  along (I don't know by whom, but it has been said) that most of American Blues is just transformed African music, and I think this  album clearly illustrates that. The resemblance between this music and just about any album by John Lee Hooker is quite amazing at  times.The lyrics are somewhat repetitive in that African chanting style, but the music that weaves under and around the lyrics is phenomenal  at times. Ry Cooder does a good job of extending some more traditional blues stylings into the great music that is led by Toure, just  as he has with so many other international artists.My favorite track from this CD is &quot;Gomni&quot; this track is a very emotional song about hard work and the effects it has on the  individual. The melody is trance like at times but changes around enough that it feels almost vivacious in its sound. There are quite a  few other great songs on here like &quot;Bonde&quot;, &quot;Amandrai&quot; and &quot;Keito&quot; but they all have to be listened to truly appreciate their beauty.  The CD as a whole works very well and seems to present a unified face of music that winds around your heart and your ears, much  like the Niger river that flows through Toure's homeland.My one complaint about this CD is that maybe Ry left this CD too much up to Toure, Cooder's great work is almost overpowered by  the singer/guitarist wonderful sounds. I think that Cooder achieved a much better synthesis on the Buena Vista Social Club and on  BVSC presents Ibrahim Ferrer, where he works with some Cuban musicians. I've also heard that his work on A Meeting by the  River is really good, where he teams up with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt and looks at classical Indian music.If you like this CD I would recommend any of the ones mentioned above as well as Kulanjan where the Blues artists Taj Mahal teams  up with another Mali artist Toumani Diabate. I think Taj Mahal's work is actually superior to Cooder's mainly because he injects  himself more into the CD.Nonetheless, I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to hear where American Blues music really came from, or for anyone  who is ready for something a little different. It's a great CD overall. Everytime, they asked the geo quiz I just simply could never concentrate on the question being asked and just simply melt away in the most romantic back ground music. Very nice!! This meeting of Malian guitarist Ali Farka Toure and American Ry Cooder is a pleasant listen, but is far from a ""must-have"", unless you are already a big fan of Toure or Cooder. It's pretty meager, considering the rave critical reviews when the album first came out. The music is VERY laid-back, with a couple of slow blues tunes, a couple of instrumentals featuring Toure on a njarka violin, two tracks with Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown, and a lot of forgettable tunes. The highlights are ""Soukora"" and the closing ""Diaraby"". Toure sings in four African languages, if that interests you. While I like world music, in eight years I have never once NEEDED to hear this album RIGHT NOW, a basic trait of any really good album. It's nice while you're listening to it, but it evaporates instantly from memory when the CD ends.(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal) On the surface, this is a very simple album, simple in that it is accessible, unpretentious and easy to listen to. On repeated helpings, however, Talking Tmbuktu becomes an extraordinarily beautiful ensemble of  the rock-pop (Ry Cooder) and the trad and bluesy (Toure). Take Gomni, the  heart rendering tune about &quot;hard work&quot;. The rich rhythmic  tapistry and haunting melody that shifts back and forth among variations  with amazing fluidity touches any soul.On the other hand, Lasidan, a  song about happyness is groovy and multi-layered. Blues aficiandos attempt  to catalogue Toure as the &quot;West African John Lee Hooker&quot; due to  the similarity in the low-pitched vocals and mid-tempo, foot-stomping  rhythms found in so many of his songs (like Ai Du). But I found his music  richer; technically its combo of instruments ranging from the emblematic  accoustic guitar to the calabash drums to the najarka lute create an  inimitable style. Culturally Toure's songs draw from several sources. This  is universal music, capable of reaching any heart despite the obvious  language barrier.For a mere mortal like me who picked this album on word  of mouth, it also opened a whole new doors into music from Mali. As usual, this is another spectacular disc, only made better by the addition of Ry Cooder. I've been searching for the tune Diaraby since september. I finally found it here. I heard it on ""the World"" and I haven't gotten it out of my head since. I really recommend this. Great album.

Songs from Queen through Richard Thompson to a heart stopping version of  Nick Drake's River Man. The blend on paper again is startling but sounds so  right.  I suggest all american readers rush to the amazon.co.uk site! Earlier reviewer's comment about ""the art of singing at its best"" is spot on.  I had the pleasure of seeing her live, with Eliza and Martin Carthy,  a few years ago.  She brings such heart and life to her songs.  This CD shows that the art I saw in concert is fully captured on CD. This is the art of singing at its best. From the Dead to obscure 40's songs to Richard Thompson to a Methodist hymn - what a range! Each one a nugget of a different kind.

268,518,B00000063M,"Over the past period this writer has reviewed the music of Loudon Wainwright III, the late Utah Phillips, his very much alive old friend Rosalie Sorrels and now the McGarrigle Sisters, Kate and Anna, (including, when appropriate, their family and kin musical entourage). What joins this reviewer and this gathering of folk giants together is one person and one place, Lena and Caf&eacute; Lena's coffeehouse in Saratoga, New York. That place was (and today continues to be on a lesser scale) the Mecca in upstate New York for the gathering of much folk talent, folk wisdom and just plain whimsy, including the talents of most of those mentioned above.I know Saratoga and its environs well and if New York City's Greenwich Village and Cambridge's Harvard Square are better known in the 1960s folk revival geography that locale can serve as the folk crowd's summer watering hole (and refuge from life's storms all year round). From the descriptions of the caf&eacute; `s lifestyle and of the off-beat personality of Lena, as presented in a PBS documentary about her and the place many years ago, it also was a veritable experiment in ad hoc communal living). Thus, I know the names and work of the McGarrigles well. For those not so fortunate, and to bring the younger crowd up to date, Kate McGarrigle is Rufus Wainwright's mother (and Loudon Wainwright, of course, is his father). That will tell much about Rufus' pedigree.But back to Kate and Anna. Of course they came out of Canada, like compatriots Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, and placed their stamp on a late portion of the folk revival, particularly with their beautiful harmonies, their great instrumental versatility and their songwriting replete with many memory-induced songs from their old country (including some very nice traditional songs in French). Those memory songs, perhaps, are their trademark-covering and creating a certain kind of folk music that is very traditionally driven without being maudlin as many of the very early songs in the North American Songbook tended to be. And their lyrics and melodies backed by a wide range of instruments from the banjo to the fiddle blend very nicely together.I will give one example, the one that caught my ear long ago before I knew much of Lena and Caf&eacute; Lena.  The McGarrigle song ""Talk To Me Of Mendocino"" (out in Pacific California) is written in honor of Lena. Lena, as mentioned above, was very troubled in many ways, although something of a fairy godmother to the upstate New York folk scene. One single line of ""Mendocino"" captures Lena's turmoil very concisely- ""never had the blues from whence I came, in New York State I got `em"". That line in combination with the almost ethereal melody line that evokes the spray of the ocean gives just the right sense about the plight of that troubled lady. This is the kind of thoughtful presentation that dominates their working ethos.  Listen up.Most of the selections here were written by one or the other, or both sisters. A look at the liner notes (that also include the lyrics to each song, always a nice touch) indicates that, whether written by them or not, they are playing their full array of musical instruments on theses tracks (also nice). Sticks outs here are ""Heart Like A Wheel, a song that Linda Ronstadt (and perhaps others) successfully covered, the above-mentioned ""Talk To Me Of Mendocino"", ""Tell My Sister"" and the poignant ""Go Leave"". Brings back 80's memories. So sorry one of the sisters recently passed away. Their songs will keep them alivefor years to come. It's spooky to find so many of my feelings about this album echoed in these reviews. Between us, my partner and I bought about 6 copies (first vinyl albums which wore out and had to be replaced, audiophile pressings, CDs) before we met. If we could rescue one single record from our collection, this would be it. I was hooked from the first few seconds of &quot;Kiss and Say Goodbye&quot;, and am still just as hooked 28 years on. I learned about Kate and Anna about 30 years ago by reading about them in Rollingstone Magazine. We've never looked back. For me, they are the best. Their harmonies are beautiful and every song on the CD is better than the one that I just listened to.If you are new fan of K&A;, listen to the song samples. This is the sister's oldest album and it is one of their best. Without complex instrumental backing, the emphasis is on the lyrics and the simple melodies. The lyrics range from humourous to melancholy and the harmonies (as always) are magical. The cafe stlye music of this albums sets an idle background for the sister's unusual voices, displaying them to their best advantage. There was a time in the 70s when Little Feat's Lowell George could do no wrong.  Every album on which he and his magnificent slide guitar guested turned to gold: for instance, Robert Palmer's 'Pressure Drop', Jackson Browne's 'Pretender', and this delightful debut.  Here he appears on just two tracks, along with such session aces as fusion drummer Steve Gadd and bassist Tony Levin (pre-King Crimson!).But that fleeting appearance was sufficient to bring this record to the attention of the critics in the UK, particularly on the NME and Sounds newspapers.  Very quickly this became an impossible-to-categorise cult album.  It still appears in compilations of the Top 500 albums of all time.  There are waltzes, there are love songs, there are dirges, there's a strong folk flavour running throughout.  No singles were released, as far as I can remember.Now here's the rub: though I've been aware of the album for a quarter of a century, I had never heard any of it until I bought the CD late last year.  I am not normally a fan of folk, but I simply adore this album.  It took some listenings for me to cast aside my jazz/prog leanings, but it is a gorgeous record that deserves much wider acceptance.  You can play it almost anywhere and on almost any occasion.I'm told the follow-up, 'Dancer with Bruised Knees', was a disappointment, simply because this LP set such a high standard. This disc is an essential for anybody with an ear. The material and production values have held up beautifully over time; and the performances are first rate:  the layers of harmony still beguile after all these years. These are unique artists. It is really tough to pigeon-hole their style, but why bother? This effort merits inclusion in any list of great [...] music - it is great stuff. If you love Folk Music and beautiful female voices this is for you. It has become one of my favorites. Kate and Anna McGarrigle's CD of twelve songs, first produced in 1975, is in my view one of the most beautiful and moving collections ever made. The songs are mostly about relationships with parents and with boyfriends, but there are also lovely ones about swimming, religion, travel, and the French-Canadian community. Perhaps the greatest is called 'The Jigsaw Puzzle of Life'. All the songs are superbly accompanied by guitars, banjos, piano, and many other instruments, and the harmonies are complex and often surprising. Every time I listen to the twelve songs, they bring tears to my eyes. I first heard of the McGarrigle sisters way back in the seventies when Linda Ronstadt covered Heart Like a Wheel, and suddenly discovered them again when I bought Emmylou Harris' incredible Wrecking Ball because I wanted to hear her version of Lucinda Williams' Sweet Old World (great cover but the original can't be beat).  I discovered then that one of the best tracks on the Emmylou album ""Going Back To Harlan"" was written by the McGarrigles.  I got all curious and decided to come to Amazon to find out what else they have done.That was the best thing that happened to me the past 6 months.  I first ordered this album out of curiousity and just fell in love with every single track.  It is a total miracle and disgrace that this album is not on the TOP 10 ALBUM of ALL TIMES.  I can remember very few albums and artists that have touched me as much, perhaps Joni Mitchell's Blue and Lucinda Williams' Car Wheels.  I have a feeling that this one has legs and will remain my favorite for a long long time. I knew of the McGarrigle sisters back in the 1970s partly because of Linda Ronstadt's recording of Heart Like A Wheel and partly because of music media buzz which showered them with hosannahs. But I never really listened to them until a couple of years ago when I heard them sing backing vocals on Nick Cave's magnificent No More Shall We Part recording. So I went out and picked up a couple of their old CDs so I'd have a sampling and in the process found out that I'd been missing a whole lot of great music.First of all, the sisters' harmonies are positively angelic. Then there is the simplicity of the music, with its laid-back almost rural feel accentuated by fiddles, mandolins, and accordions. The combination of the two makes for an almost exotic listening treat.My favorites here are Kiss and Say Goodbye, My Town, Foolish You, Complainte Pour Ste-Catherine, Swimming Song, and Travellin' On For Jesus. The sisters are ably backed by an all-star crew including veteran drummer Steve Gadd, the late, great Lowell George on guitars, journeyman bass player, now prog-master, Tony Levin and others.As it turned out, Kate and Anna McGarrigle's debut was very influential in country and country rock circles when it was current. After 30 years and many albums, they remain the finest active female Canadian vocalists. If you have not yet heard these ladies sing, its time to break down and order this. I'm glad I did. This LP/CD is pure listening pleasure. An absolute joy. Each song is very distinctive (instrumentation changing constantly) and some of them, as seen in previous reviews, are truly touching. Kiss and Say Goodbye, a joyful funky smile-on-the-face opener. Blues in D, glorious with its piano syncopation and clarinet. Mendocini is a song like no other, the best harmony I ever heard. Go Leave, truly touching in its simplicity. Honestly, I can think of only one better way to spend 45 minutes. This was the first McGarrigle album that I had the good fortune to acquire.  It had made Rolling Stone's 1976 10 Best List, and I'm a folkie at heart.  Not knowing quite what to expect I popped it in my tape player [we used those a lot in the old days] and found myself surprised by a unique take on singer/songwriter 'folk' music which was completely different from the more polished work becoming common in the U.S. at that time.Not that the McGarrigle sisters are anything less than consummate musicians, but they eschew some of the sound processing that often makes everyone sound the same.  Instead they stay with their natural, slightly edgy voices that are almost a nostalgic reminder of the 30's and 40's.  Their musical styling is northern American (U.S. and Canadian) in that you keep hearing an accordion that isn't their.Even after all these years, this album sounds fresh and interesting.  It's hard to point to any particular cut on this recording as true favorites, but I probably like 'Talk to Me of Mendocino' and 'Complainte Pour Ste. Catherine' the best.  While their stylings are completely different, both take traditional approaches to interesting subjects.  If you haven't heard the McGarrigles yet, this is a great place to start. This is truly an upbeat, fun, beautifully mastered piece. I think the best of their albums over all. It's one I never tire of hearing and play it constantly. The quality of this album is best heard at top volume. Just great fun! I wish they had kept with this type of venue; their other albums don't come up to this excitement. This is a  brilliant album that will retain its timeless sophistication  forever.  Every song has its own wonderful characteristics, and the song  writing is phenomenal.  It's no wonder that artist upon artist use Kate and  Annie's music.  I can't say enough about this album!!! They were odd and quirky then, and the same holds for today. Wistful and knowing, sweet and sharp, this recording has as much charm and integrity today as when it was first recorded. Excellent morning music, especially, for those bittersweet mornings after. I don't know exactly what it is about this CD. Maybe I am just sentimental, as it is the soundtrack of the first five years of my marriage.  But the writing and rhythms are so unique and unpredictable, their voices are soindescribably singular this is just the most perfect album of all time. And I am no folky. Most of what I listen to is punk and hiphop. But disaster has struck; a year and a half ago my husband and I left this CD in a rental car never to be heard from again and now it is out of print!!! Our lives will never be the same. Gorgeous arrangements and the sweetest sibling voices I'd heard since Don & Phil Everly; this album burst into my world, seemingly from another era, in 1975. It came to my ears, like so many of my 70s classics, courtesy of the genial Chris Winter on Australian radio's best source of non-mainstream music,'Room To Move.' It was a generous sampling, though one song,'Mendocino' would have sufficed to lure me to the import shops the next day. Its slow surging, oceanic orchestral arrangement still puts me on edge. It also introduced to me the zaniness of Loudon Wainwright 111's writing, with 'Swimming Song', now part of our family singalongs.'Jigsaw Puzzle of Life,' & 'Go, Leave', seem to have been drawn from an ancient well. The sisters have recorded consistently over the decades & I welcomed the 'McGarrigle Hour' when it was released, with the full complement of McGarrigle couplings & progeny. They have made albums as good,'Dancer,' & 'Bruised Knees'come to mind, but none better than this stunning debut album. Its pop-leaning sensibility would lead me towards a happy decade's romance with Rounder Records, to source the roots from whence this marvel issued. There isn't much to add to the comments here, other than to say it's really no surprise to find such unanimity.  This is an outstanding recording, an all-time winner, never to be forgotten.I've followed Kate and Anna since this recording first came out, and have seen them live many times.  They continue to be outstanding musicians, and the extended family continues to contribute to our musical experience in wonderfully varied ways.  I'm particularly fond of Kate's daughterMartha Wainwright, and have a soft spot for son Rufus (e.g.Release the Stars) as well. talk about a part of the soundtrack of your life-this is it! Talk To Me Of Mendocino...that song alone is worth the price of admission. These women are two of the best songwriters around. Their later work has unfailingly kept pace with this one. Idiosyncratic to a lovely degree-personal and intimate like the creases in an old shoe, they are truly themselves, and that is pretty rare in any age. incredible music: touching, heartbreaking, funny , fun and melodic, with breathtaking harmonies. as fresh today as when i first heard it {was it 30 years ago?}the songs stay with me thru all these many years, and i,ve played them to death.Truly groundbreaking stuff with ""heart like a wheel"", ""talk to me of mendocino"" and ""go, leave"" on the same album. Kate's passing last year was devastating to those of us who love her and her music and she will never be replaced! this album is as good as it gets in this genre. pounce on it. Beautiful songs sung with intricate harmonies. Had not heard them for many years and was delighted to come across them again. Like others, I had heard ABOUT recordings by these two, and chanced upon this one.  As it unfolded in my ears, I realized, ""Oh, this is THAT album, the Desert Island Disc I've read about.""What a delight and a blessing to discover such a collection of music!  No kidding, just buy this album!  It's difficult to compare it to anything, it is just lovely!  I have the most eclectic taste in music of anyone I know, from King Crimson to Frank Zappa to Joni Mitchell to James Brown to Jewel to Coltrane to Wings to Sex Pistols, and this album just GETS RIGHT IN YOU.If you know the withering heartbreak of Dylan's ""Blood on the Tracks"" and the disarming simplicity of Harry Nilsson's ""The Point"" then you will love this album. ""Heart Like a Wheel"" is now officially my Favorite Sad Song.Give these wonderful ladies some of your money, right away. Suffice it to say they've made a convert of me. I chose this rating because of the vocal harmonies on songs like the track,Talk to Me of Mendocino.  The instrumentation definately showcases their Quebec heritage.  Some tracks are filled with a certain melancholy i.e. Go Leave while others show a marvelous humor such as Kiss and Say Goodbye and The Swumming Song.  Although the Mc Garrigles are anglophones they do include one song in French.  This is simply great folk music.","Folk Rock,Contemporary Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,Singer-Songwriters,Rock,Folk",past period writer reviewed loudon wainwright iii late utah phillips much alive old friend rosalie sorrels mcgarrigle sisters kate anna including appropriate family kin musical entourage joins reviewer gathering folk giants together one person one place lena caf eacute lenas coffeehouse saratoga new york place today continues lesser scale mecca upstate new york gathering much folk talent folk wisdom plain whimsy including talents mentioned know saratoga environs well new york citys greenwich village cambridges harvard square better known folk revival geography locale serve folk crowds summer watering hole refuge lifes storms year round descriptions caf eacute lifestyle beat personality lena presented past period writer reviewed loudon loudon wainwright iii wainwright late utah phillips alive old old friend friend rosalie sorrels sorrels mcgarrigle sisters sisters anna including appropriate family kin musical entourage joins reviewer gathering folk giants person place caf coffeehouse new new york york york place place today continues lesser scale upstate upstate new york new new york york gathering folk talent folk folk wisdom wisdom plain whimsy including talents mentioned know saratoga environs new new york new york citys york york citys citys greenwich village village square better known folk folk revival revival geography locale serve folk crowds summer watering watering hole hole refuge lifes storms year round descriptions lifestyle beat personality presented
269,523,B00000066S,"Jon Faddis is the man!  This is one of the most well-rounded trumpet albums I've ever heard.  Not only that, it's probably the best album of the 1980's (okay maybe not much competition there).  Jon Faddis is absolutely insane as both a trumpet player and musician.  He pays tribute to Louis Armstrong beautifully, even quoting the introduction Armstrong recorded on &quot;West End Blues&quot;.  His imitation is spot on, but he manages to keep his own instrumental voice.  He pays homage to Roy Eldridge on &quot;Little Jazz&quot;, which is a classic in itself and Faddis plays one of my top five favorite solos on this tune.  &quot;A Night In Tunisia&quot; is yet another fantastic recording of the tune, although I feel Faddis overdoes the high register playing a bit on this tune, he still plays a nice solo.  Brilliant ensemble playing as well.  He delivers on his own tunes too, as shown in &quot;Instigator&quot;, where he plays a crazy muted solo flying all over the horn.  Yet another tribute to Dizzy is &quot;Things To Come&quot; where he plays a great solo on an extremely fast pace.  This song definitely is given the Dizzy feel.  &quot;A Child Is Born&quot; is a nice, mellow Thad Jones composition.  This is great musicianship and Faddis solos over the whole song.  Some of the best flugelhorn playing since Miles Ahead.  Then he shows more amazing flugel playing on a fine rendition of Neal Hefti's classic &quot;Li'l Darlin'&quot;, and a cool muted version of Benny Golson's &quot;Whisper Not&quot;.  And how about the sidemen on this date?  Former Clifford Brown-Max Roach member Harold Land on tenor saxophone, young lion Kenny Baron on piano, the impeccable Ray Brown on bass, and the wonderful Mel Lewis on drums (co-leader and drummer in the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis big band).  Overall there is great playing from everyone.  Check out Ray Brown's bass solo on &quot;West End Blues&quot;.  A classic.  Must-have. This is worth it simply to hear West End Blues.  I have several of Louis' recordings of it but the 1927 sound quality is not good.  Faddis plays this and you can finally hear, with modern equipment, just what an astonishing  breakthrough the original was.  Faddis is true to all of his mentors, even  doing great credit to Dizzy's signature piece, Night in Tunisia. Jon Faddis is an amazing trumpet player.  There's no way around that.  Not only is his command of high notes amazing, but his tone is extremely smooth and he can play in all kinds of different musical environments.  The constant changes in setting are a big part in what makes Legacy such a great album.  Faddis not only pays homage to some of his trumpet playing ancestors but he also shows he has his own voice.  Not a moment of this album is boring, it stays interesting whether Faddis is playing a rip-roaring Gillespie bebop tune or a relaxing Thad Jones ballad.  In fact, I would probably rate it among my all-time favorites because since I received this album, I have not stopped playing it.  Another aspect of this album that makes it great is the arsenal of players Jon Faddis chooses to perform with: Harold Land (who played with Clifford Brown on many records) on tenor saxophone, Kenny Barron (a big up-and-comer in modern jazz) on piano, Ray Brown (a legend) on bass and Mel Lewis (a great drummer who keeps an amazing pulse throughout the record; don't take him for granted).  This record deserves high expectations and will not disappoint.The opening has Faddis blowing a crazy blues cadenza into the Joe Oliver-Clarence Williams tune &quot;West End Blues&quot;.  Louis Armstrong made the original recording of this tune famous, and Faddis's masterful soloing in the upper register mixed with a great sense of rhythm and the flawless &quot;growling&quot; trick make something Mr. Armstrong would probably have enjoyed.  Ray Brown takes a nice bass solo in the middle of the song, it appears kind of abruptly but it's great.  &quot;Little Jazz&quot;, a Roy Eldridge tune, has Faddis doing another great solo - one of my favorite solos on record.  Here he also growls and does a pretty good job of imitating Roy's style while still maintaining his own sound and voice.  Harold Land and Kenny Barron join the fun with nice swinging solos, Kenny has some Herbie Hancock-like moments.  His remake of Dizzy Gillespie's famous classic &quot;A Night In Tunisia&quot; will definitely capture the listener's attention, when he blasts a loud cadenza at the beginning as if he's telling you to listen what he has to say.  This is a great recording of the tune, Harold Land comes with a nice saxophone solo and Faddis's insane trills will knock you out.  They play the tune in a weird staccato style too, which makes it even more enjoyable.  &quot;Instigator&quot; is just what the tune says, something that will make things start up.  This is an original composition by Faddis, and he plays a crazy muted solo after Land's strong opening solo.  The rhythm section switches up throughout which gives a superb effect.  The tempo is speedy so it takes a good rhythm section to keep that up.  When Faddis and Land trade back and forth with Mel Lewis, everything clicks perfectly.  &quot;Things To Come&quot; is another Gillespie remake, and yet another example of the excitement that Faddis's soloing can create.  He goes for more of a Latin-tinged sound here and it works very well.  His playing sounds like it is effortless over this whirlwind tempo.  Kenny Barron also takes an amazingly quick solo, flying across the keys.  The only criticism of this track is the fact that it's relatively short and Harold Land doesn't take a solo, and it's not quite clear why he's missing from this song.  &quot;A Child Is Born&quot; shows Faddis playing a more sensitive tune.  He moves on from the hard bop sound and into a very sweet Thad Jones ballad.  This is perhaps the most impressive track on the album, despite all of the hear-opening virtuosic lines Faddis plays on the other songs.  The reason being because he plays with such beauty in tone, and he plays for almost seven minutes straight over this tune and remains focused.  That takes a lot of maturity.  &quot;Li'l Darlin'&quot; is a Neal Hefti tune that is often played in big bands, but they use the combo setting here.  Faddis takes a more laid-back approach to this tune, and uses a more Miles Davis-like sound for his solo.  Ray Brown's bass-work is perfect for this song, and it's another successful showcase for Faddis.  The Benny Golson-Leonard Feather tune &quot;Whisper Not&quot; is a nice way to end the album because it combines the facets of the fast-paced bop tunes and the laid-back ballads.  This moderate tempo piece features a jazzy muted solo from Faddis and a cool solo from Harold Land.  The bridge part with the screaming trumpet is amazing, and it's really swinging by the time Kenny Barron takes over.  A good ending song.Dizzy Gillespie wasn't kidding when he said this album was terrifying.  A lot of really great playing from everyone is on this album.  If you're interested in great jazz trumpet playing, or if you like Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, Roy Eldridge, Thad Jones and other great jazz trumpet players with great technique, you won't regret buying this album. I am old enough to remember Cat Anderson and his high notes....Jon Faddis has an ability to takes these high notes and wrap them in velvet while he keeps on going higher and higher.  WOW!  If you like the sound of a hot trumpet and you want to hear the highs without wincing and wondering whether the note will fall off the cliff, this is the CD for you.  This Faddis is one for the ages.  Thanks for the journey, I'll go back to this CD over and over again just to take the trip with him!","Jazz,Pop,Bebop",jon faddis man one well rounded trumpet ive ever heard probably best okay maybe much competition jon faddis absolutely insane trumpet player musician pays tribute louis armstrong beautifully even quoting introduction armstrong recorded quot west end blues quot imitation spot manages keep instrumental voice pays homage roy eldridge quot little jazz quot classic faddis plays one top five favorite solos tune quot night tunisia quot yet another fantastic recording tune although feel faddis overdoes high register playing bit tune still plays nice solo brilliant ensemble playing well delivers tunes shown quot instigator quot plays crazy muted solo flying horn yet another tribute dizzy quot things come quot h jon faddis man rounded trumpet heard probably best okay maybe competition jon faddis absolutely insane trumpet trumpet player player musician pays tribute louis louis armstrong beautifully quoting introduction armstrong recorded west end blues end blues imitation spot manages keep instrumental voice pays homage roy eldridge eldridge quot little jazz jazz quot classic plays favorite solos tune night tunisia quot fantastic recording tune feel overdoes high register playing bit tune plays nice solo brilliant ensemble playing delivers tunes shown quot instigator quot plays crazy muted solo flying horn tribute dizzy quot things come quot
270,525,B0000006C0,"Howard Roberts was well-known as an educator (he was a founder of GIT), studio musician (he clocked so many session hours as an LA studio musician that he was referred to as ""The Fifth Monkey""), and as columnist for Guitar Player Magazine (Roberts and colleague Jerry Hahn practically invented the &quot;guitar columnist&quot; genre).  One might therefore expect this to be an album of interest primarily to aficionados of jazz guitar.  In fact, The Real Howard Roberts is as accessible as any jazz album ever recorded.  Even so, Roberts' consummate musicianship is everywhere in evidence.  Recorded in a single August day in Hollywood in 1977, Roberts leads a tight quartet (with the late great Ray Brown on bass) through pop tunes (a stunning version of Michael Franks' ""Lady Wants to Know""), standards (""Darn that Dream"", ""Gone with the Wind"") and jazz classics (""All Blues"", ""Dolphin Dance"").  There is real virtuosity on display in each cut.  If you're curious about Roberts, this is the place to begin.  And be prepared to enjoy every last minute. This album is indeed the straight jazz record all of Howard's fans and students wanted him to make.  It's also quite possibly the finest jazz-guitar album of the '70s when compared to his fellow jazz guitarists.  Benson had gone commercial, Wes was dead, Tal Farlow was in retirement and Herb Ellis & Barney Kessel were sticking to live work.  This album is a welcome throwback to '50s jazz guitar and because Roberts was such a well-rounded guitar man, he was able to truly display all of his abilities in a then modern light. Effortlessly, I may add.With great material and a killer band to back him up, &#34;The Real Howard Roberts&#34; is the H.R. album to get. I believe this is Howard's finest studio jazz recording. It is a shame that it is out of print. 5 stars Roberts made many recording but many where pop records, full of corny pop songs.  This is a true jazz record, with a great band, solos, and jazz feel.  If you are a jazz guitar fan/collector, you need to add this to your  collection.  No BS stuff here, this is the real mccoy! Throughout his long and successful career Howard Roberts played a lot of substandard music, but this session allowed him to stretch out and just play jazz.  It's a killer collection, and everyone here is at the top of his game.  The CD includes a bonus track, &#34;All Blues,&#34; which wasn't on the original LP release. Over the years I've heard about Howard Roberts, but his albums didn't get a mention along with those of Montgomery, Farlow, Smith, Burrell, Green, etc.  He was obviously a good player, because his name was always being mentioned, but was he a jazz player?  This is a perennial problem, because a good 'jazz' player can make - or contribute to - albums which aren't 'jazz albums'at all.  Howard was obviously a great player with a really good sound like other super session men such as Tommy Tedesco or Larry Carlton.  Many session players enhance records, but don't make a memorable statement of their own in the Jazz Guitar world.I'd read that The Real Howard Roberts was his jazz statement.  I listened to samples on Amazon.com and decided to pay out silly money for the CD.  It was obvious from the samples that this would be a rewarding album.  Great guitar sound, similar, say, to Larry Coryell or Kenny Burrell, and more modern in approach and use of guitaristic effects.  This is a obviously a player who has brought his day-to-day session skills to the making of a jazz album.Does it work?  Is it an integral album?  I believe it is.  I love the sound of the guitar, the playing is imaginative, and the rhythm section is obviously first class.  Howard Roberts has, on this album, made a statement as a jazz player and it was definitely worth the expense.  Not ground-breaking, but really enjoyable.","Easy Listening,Jazz,Pop,Cool Jazz",howard roberts well known educator founder git studio musician clocked many session hours la studio musician referred fifth monkey columnist guitar player magazine roberts colleague jerry hahn practically invented quot guitar columnist quot genre one might therefore expect interest primarily aficionados jazz guitar fact real howard roberts accessible jazz ever recorded even roberts consummate musicianship everywhere evidence recorded single august day hollywood roberts leads tight quartet late great ray brown bass pop tunes stunning version michael franks lady wants know standards darn dream gone wind jazz classics blues dolphin dance real virtuosity display cut youre curious roberts place begin prepared enjoy every last minute howard roberts known educator founder git studio studio musician musician clocked session hours studio studio musician musician referred fifth monkey columnist guitar guitar player guitar player magazine player magazine colleague jerry jerry hahn practically invented guitar columnist quot genre one expect interest primarily aficionados jazz jazz guitar guitar fact real howard roberts accessible jazz recorded consummate musicianship evidence recorded single august day hollywood leads tight quartet late great ray brown bass pop pop tunes tunes stunning version michael franks lady wants know standards darn dream wind jazz jazz classics classics blues dolphin dolphin dance dance real virtuosity display cut youre curious place begin prepared enjoy last minute minute
271,534,B0000006EK,"""Exectutive Suite"" is a reminder of what a fine group the LA 4 was.  Reedman Bud Shank, guitarist Laurindo Almeida, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Jeff Hamilton, outstanding musicians all, played together so seamlessly they are like the inner workings of a fine watch.  ""Executive Suite"" is also a reminder of what a great musician Bud Shank is and I do mean great!  Listen to him on the discs first and second cuts, Hamilton's ""Blues Wellington"" and Almeida's ""Amazonia.""  The former starts soft and lovely with Almeida's acoustic guitar; then Shank enters, his growling sax bursting into a passionate solo.  His flute work on ""Amazonia"" is both beautiful and forceful.  This CD is well worth owning as are all of the LA 4 releases. I am an audiophile as well as having had a life long love affair with Jazz.The play-back system I've put together has the ability to resolve a recordingwith extraordinary detail..This can work against me if the recording has not been engineered well in the first place.So the performance has to be a good one with good originality and musicianshipand it has to give me my audiophile thrill ride at the same time.I find that the Concord label is really great..Many of the LA4 recordings areexcellent and fulfill both elements admirably.I'm not saying that they are the last word in ""HIPNESS"" but very good strait ahead jazz with conceptual and memorable arrangements..I can't speak to the period before Jeff Hamilton because at this time I have not yet listened to the older recordings with Shelly Manne on drums..I recommend this series highly to folks that get a kick out of very well recorded material.","Jazz,Pop,Cool Jazz",exectutive suite reminder fine group la reedman bud shank guitarist laurindo almeida bassist ray brown drummer jeff hamilton outstanding musicians played together seamlessly like inner workings fine watch executive suite also reminder great musician bud shank mean great listen discs first second cuts hamiltons blues wellington almeidas amazonia former starts soft lovely almeidas acoustic guitar shank enters growling sax bursting passionate solo flute work amazonia beautiful forceful cd well worth owning la releases audiophile well life long love affair jazz play back system ive put together ability resolve recordingwith extraordinary detail work recording engineered well first place performance good suite reminder fine group reedman bud bud shank shank guitarist laurindo almeida bassist ray ray brown brown drummer jeff jeff hamilton outstanding musicians played seamlessly inner workings fine watch executive executive suite suite reminder great musician bud bud shank shank mean great listen discs second cuts blues amazonia starts soft lovely acoustic acoustic guitar guitar shank enters growling sax bursting passionate solo flute work beautiful forceful cd worth releases life long love love affair affair jazz play play back system put together ability resolve extraordinary detail work recording engineered place performance good

273,547,B0000006HU,"I have owned this record by Jim for several years and I find it very beautiful. Even if it has some synthesizers added here and there, which may be considered an awkward decision by a Jazz master, in this case I wouldn't agree. This recording remind me of another successful attempt in this sport (mixing traditional sounds with modern touches on a standards repertoire), which is Michel Petrucciani ""Live"". Beautiful! This one is different, it's softer, more intimate than the Petrucciani album. It's very beautiful in the sense that in my opinion let Jim personality on the guitar shine very brightly and in an extremely clear way. I feel him free to improvise because he has a full ensemble behind him (with Gil Goldstein playing piano and the few keys), something that he had not so often in the past (he played a lot of records as the main harmonic instrument, a role very difficult and limiting in a sense for a guitarist or as a part of a duo...). Well, this album is very easy to love. It is very melodic, .. don't be fooled by what I have just said. There are keyboard touches here and there, but this is absolutely Jazz, nothing less (it's nothing near the elevator music, if someone had such a doubt). It is the music Jim is very well know for, a delicate, intimate, storytelling kind of Jazz that a lot of people in this case may like becuase it is very accessible (even if deep musically as Jim always is). The program is various enough, there are some standards some Jazz originals, some songs written by Jim and some written by Jane Hall, that I believe is his wife. The band is wonderful. Goldstein piano, Steve La Spina double bass, Terry Clark drums. Two more considerations, one is about the audio quality which is very high (I have the normal cd version, NOT the SACD). The second consideration, that I repeat closing my review is that this is a very easy to love album that everyone can enjoy even people not very familiar with Jazz because Jimm playing is very easy to follow and the ensemble plays in a very conservative way (but still really great). Nice Uncle Jim!PS (By the way I find the cover extremely beautiful, ... Jim is there on his terrace, relaxed with his precious D'Aquisto guitar in his hand in a lovely summer Jazz evening, ... with the Towers still there... a very peaceful and happy image to me). A crystal clear CD,replacing a scratchy old LP. The clarity of this remaster(?) is astounding and so necessary for this guitar format.A lucky find from a great vendor JK Hall's small handful of Concord albums in the 1980s were sort of studio extensions of the sound and approach found on the great trio record ""Jim Hall Live!"" album from 1975. This, the final Concord session, adds keyboards to the trio sound, but otherwise the record is another mix of standards and originals played in his inimitable style. The 90s saw Hall mix things up with a new concept or unusual grouping of musicians on almost every release; it wasn't until 2004's Magic Meeting that he cut another record with a standard rhythm section where he didn't share the spotlight with a horn player or more elaborate orchestration. Hall usually succeeds on at least a few cuts no matter what his concept or context, but the Concord records are easy recommendations for those who want more of his earlier sound and style that influenced many, many players from the famous to the weekend warriors.Trivia time: Anyone notice that the cover of this 1989 release is similar to the cover of John Scofield's 1989 ""Flat Out"", with the difference being that Scofield's cover is shot at night and Sco's rooftop backdrop is grittier and more ""urban"" feeling (a bit of graffiti on the low concrete ledge is all you see behind Sco, whereas Hall sits in an elegant rooftop garden). I've always wondered if Sco was paying a little tribute, though it could easily be a coincidence or even Hall tipping his hat to John. ""All Across the City"" released on Concord Records in 1989 is a very fine recording. Jim Hall who is known collectively as the ""Godfather of Modern Jazz Guitar"" really plays great jazz guitar. His subtle sense of swing, harmony, and melody have made him a legend. You can hear his influence in other jazz guitar masters like Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell, and John Abercrombie. You can probably even hear it in my own playing! Who knows!I'm not going to talk too much about the music because the music can speak for itself, but let me add that this is a beautiful album. Every tune is just a world of its own. On a special note, Gil Goldstein gives a remarkable performance. His presence on this album gives it a very special feeling.Pick this album up if you're into jazz guitar and more importantly are a fan of Jim Hall.","Adult Contemporary,Jazz,Pop,Modern Postbebop,Bebop,Cool Jazz",owned record jim several years find beautiful even synthesizers added may considered awkward decision jazz master case wouldnt agree recording remind another successful attempt sport mixing traditional sounds modern touches standards repertoire michel petrucciani live beautiful one different softer intimate petrucciani beautiful sense opinion let jim personality guitar shine brightly extremely clear way feel free improvise full ensemble behind gil goldstein playing piano keys something often past played lot records main harmonic instrument role difficult limiting sense guitarist part duo well easy love melodic dont fooled record jim years find beautiful synthesizers added considered awkward decision jazz master case agree recording successful attempt sport mixing traditional sounds modern touches standards repertoire michel petrucciani live beautiful different intimate beautiful sense opinion let jim personality guitar shine brightly extremely clear way feel feel free free full ensemble gil goldstein playing piano piano keys keys past played lot records main harmonic instrument role difficult limiting sense guitarist duo easy love melodic dont fooled
274,549,B0000006JQ,"All of the pieces on this CD are available as note-for-note piano transcriptions, which I'm working through.  Listening to McPartland play when you're familiar with the transcripts gives a fresh appreciation for her incredible technique and innovative arrangements.  My favorite is her take on Ornette Coleman's ""Turn Around,"" in which she magically turns a solo piano into an entire jazz trio. I love Marian McPartland ! This is my favorite McPartland CD. Interesting chord progressions and sensitive interpretations abound. I have listened to this CD over and over. It is still in my CD changer. While the piano playing cannot be faulted, the applause is very distracting because it seems louder then you would actually hear in the room.  It doesn't contribute to a sense of immediacy that some live concert recordings have.  It's just plain annoying. This recording is a tour de force of solo piano playing. I often play Bill Evans, and Oscar Peterson, and Dave Brubeck, and Keith Jarrett, and Chick Corea, and so on down the list of great jazz pianists. Marian McPartland is not only right in there with these ebony tapping cats, she's up at the ivory top. There is a reason why Dave Brubeck called her one of the top three pianists of the 20th century, maybe like me he has never heard such swinging sonic beauty. This is a beautiful CD.  Only a pianist with Marian McPartland's experience of jazz piano styles and delicate ear could produce an album this divine.  Marian is able to draw on such a wide variety of harmonic styles that she can make everyday tunes like My Funny Valentine and Willow Weep for Me sound like you're hearing them for the first time.  Also, the recording quality of this live performance is excellent.  A great CD that I have listened to over and over again. Marian McPartland has to be one of the greatest jazz pianists who ever lived...male or female. She is wonderful and this album/CD is one of her best. Many think it is her best. Amazon is right there again for what I want to order and sending it to me. I hate to ruin the 5 star average for this wonderful CD, but I had a hard time getting past the *loud* clapping after each song and before the first (a total of 17 times!). Apparently the mikes were way too close to the audience, giving the CD listener a real jolt between those beautiful pieces, some of them played quite softly. What's not to like about Marian McPartland!  Her music is beautifully soft and melodic.  When she plays the piano you can feel the softness of her touch on the keyboard.  She doesn't pound the keys nor does she play obnoxious songs.  She prefers ballads, as do I.  She's a wonderful entertainer and interviewer on her weekly Friday, NPR spotlight on KCBX radio 90.1 in San Luis Obispo, CA Being a huge fan of Marian McPartland, I admit that I am biased, but this CD is one of her finest achievements. Everything about it, from the wide-ranging choice of materials, to the sterling performances, the beauty of the piano used and the warm, resonant natural ambiance of the Maybeck Recital Hall add up to a recording I would recommend to anyone without hesitation. I have just been on a long road trip, and this CD was playing over and over in the car. Never got tired of it! Buy it! Marian McPartland continued to grow  pianistically throughout her long carrier. This solo album with excellent sound at Maybeck Hall is a testament to her wonderful touch and her imaginative use of chord progressions. I enjoyed her records as a kid in the 1950's (her trio with drummer Joe Morello was a standout) and I am rediscovering her more recent works with great pleasure. --TG","Swing Jazz,Jazz,Pop",pieces cd available note note piano transcriptions im working listening mcpartland play youre familiar transcripts gives fresh appreciation incredible technique innovative arrangements favorite take ornette colemans turn around magically turns solo piano entire jazz trio love marian mcpartland favorite mcpartland cd interesting chord progressions sensitive interpretations abound listened cd still cd changer piano playing cannot faulted applause distracting seems louder would actually hear room doesnt contribute sense immediacy live concert recordings plain annoying recording tour de force solo piano playing often play bill evans oscar peterson dave brubeck keith jarrett chick corea lis pieces cd available note note piano piano transcriptions transcriptions working listening mcpartland play youre familiar transcripts fresh appreciation incredible technique innovative arrangements favorite ornette ornette colemans colemans turn turn around magically turns solo piano entire jazz jazz trio trio love marian mcpartland mcpartland favorite mcpartland cd interesting chord chord progressions progressions sensitive interpretations abound listened cd cd cd changer changer piano playing faulted applause distracting seems actually hear room contribute sense immediacy live live concert concert recordings plain annoying recording tour tour de force force solo piano playing play bill bill evans oscar oscar peterson peterson dave brubeck brubeck keith keith jarrett jarrett chick chick corea lis

276,554,B0000006M4,"My first introduction to Carol Sloane's music with her deep, earthy voice, was at the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel in NYC.  She also was a close friend of Hans Ryden, the Food and Beverage Director and the ""voice"" that always introduced the talent performing at the Algonquin's Cabaret.  The selection of music on this CD is wonderful, easy listening and would highly recommend it.  Besides her talent as a wonderful jazz singer, she is just as wonderful in person! There was this Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer from Hudson Bay Canada that used to e-mail me about female jazz vocalists. This was one of his top picks if I remember right. I only played this CD a few times because a few years ago this was not my style, but after getting deeper into jazz standards I am giving this CD another spin. Great recording, good musicians, maybe for the older crowd, but then again I am in my 50's. I must of grew up & can now relax to a warm tonal female jazz singer. I believe that's it, I am used to younger higher female jazz singers & need to explore the other tonalities. Recently I turned on the T.V. & saw the end of a PBS program where a pop musical female artist was talking about how male voices are ""With"" the music, while female voices ""Float"" above the music. I never thought of this but it makes an interesting point when listening to Carol Sloane. Maybe she is ""With"" the music & its giving me another perspective. This CD is mostly a jazz trio of piano, bass, & drums with of course Carol Sloane on vocals but on 4 tracks it becomes a quintet back up with tenor sax. Check out Amazon.com ""Store"" on Carol Sloane, it's a very interesting read about her raise & fall in the 1960's, to come back as a singer in the late 1970's. Her voice exudes all of the wonderful qualities that one would attribute to an attractive mature woman..... low-pitched, husky, with an incredible refined sex appeal. If you doubt this, listen to her killer version of the old Tommy Dorsey theme ""I'm Getting Sentimental Over You"". Another favorite of mine is ""An Older Man...etc"". which, with her delivery, tends to make you feel better about the passing years (face it guys....none of us stays young forever).Actually, there isn't a bad track on the whole disk. Superb accompanyment by Stefan Scaggaiari on piano, the rest of the rhythm section being John Lockwood on bass and Colin Bailey on drums. Some nice embellishment is provided by the appearance of Frank Wess on 4 tracks, playing either tenor sax or flute.You have to try this one........actually, any of her Concord Jazz albums would be good choices.

277,560,B0000006NH,"It's a shame that a jazz vocalist as talented as Carol Sloane isn't better known. She's been singing since the early 1960s, and has an incredibly warm, husky alto. This woman really has a way with a ballad. Sloane romps  effortlessly through George and Ira Gershwin's &quot;Soon,&quot; and she  captures every bit of the wondrous imagery of the Johnny Mercer-Lionel  Hampton classic, &quot;Midnight Sun.&quot; She is simply devastating in her  delivery of &quot;Something Cool,&quot; a song associated with June  Christy. This is a fine recording, and I strongly recommend her other CDs  on the Concord label. Purchased this album for the title song, ""When I look into your eyes"".  Good rendition.  Some other songs, especially when she tried to to ""bop"" her way weren't as workable.  Overall, OK. i like jazz and i like music that is soothing, calming and this lady has it all if you are into it. Ms Sloane's voice and style  has a smoothness and finesse that comes of honing her craft through years of professionalism. On this cd she shows exquisite taste in her selection of music and brings a voice which is a mellow, self assured, smoky contralto that creates a cozy mood both on the ballads and the occasional faster numbers. She is backed by a first class group headed by Bill Charlap on piano and guitarist Howard Alden.Highlights include the excellent opener ""Give Me The Simple Life"" .....the great follow-up, Irving Berlin's ""Isn't This A Lovely Day"" which also displays some excellent accompanying bass work by Steve Gilmore.........two tunes ""owned"" by the late June Christy, ""Midnight Sun"" and ""Something Cool"" on which Ms Sloane makes a unique imprint deserving a spotlight on her own merits......Howard Alden's guitar backing and solos throughout....Bill Charlap's piano dispelling any doubt why he is a singer's choice.....the jazz treatment of ""Old Devil Moon"" in the style and tradition of Ella Fitzgerald...two outstanding ballads, the title tune and ""I Was Telling Him About You""....and the closer, a fitting uptempo ""Will You Still Be Mine"", in which Carol scats, evocative to me of Anita O'Day.This is the third cd of Carol Sloane's that I've reviewed, the others being ""Sweet And Slow"" and ""Songs Sinatra Sang"", and I find it easy to recommend all three for pure listening enjoyment!","Traditional Vocal Pop,Jazz,Vocal Jazz,Pop,Broadway & Vocalists,Vocal Pop,Bebop",shame jazz vocalist talented carol sloane isnt better known shes singing since early incredibly warm husky alto woman really way ballad sloane romps effortlessly george ira gershwins quot soon quot captures every bit wondrous imagery johnny mercer lionel hampton classic quot midnight sun quot simply devastating delivery quot something cool quot associated june christy fine recording strongly recommend cds concord label purchased title look eyes good rendition especially tried bop way werent workable overall ok like jazz like soothing calming lady ms sloanes voice style smoothness finesse comes honing craft years professionalism cd shows exquisite shame jazz jazz vocalist vocalist carol carol sloane isnt better known singing early incredibly warm husky alto woman really way ballad romps effortlessly ira gershwins gershwins soon quot captures bit wondrous imagery johnny johnny mercer mercer lionel lionel hampton classic quot midnight midnight sun sun quot simply devastating delivery quot cool quot associated june june christy christy fine recording strongly recommend cds label purchased title look eyes good rendition especially tried bop way workable overall jazz soothing calming lady ms voice style smoothness finesse comes honing craft years professionalism cd shows exquisite

The citrus colored cover and retro styling was what initially attracted me to this album, but the music would be a pleasant surprise.The first track is the famous Willy Wonka anthem &quot;The Candy Man.&quot;  Monty Alexander plays an impressive piano piece and Ray Brown, one of the greatest jazz bassists of all time, delivers as well.  Stephane Grappelli's rendition of Stevie Wonder's &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; is noteworthy as well.

281,578,B0000007DY,"gift for a friend...and very well received. `On Yoolis Night' performed by the quartet, Anonymous 4 is another collection of works dedicated to the worship of the Virgin Mary from medieval England. Unlike `An English Ladymass' and  `a Lammas Ladymass', these are more like `incidental' music for the Christmas season or, as the subtitle states, `medieval carols & motets'. Thus, these do not comprise a complete mass and there is very little polyphony. There is much more singing in unison and `chanting'.Six (6) of the 23 tracks are in Old or Middle English and may not be much more understandable to our modern ear than the 17 tracks in Latin. While seven (7) of the works are described as `carols', including one entitled `Ave Maria', not one will be known to either your neighborhood Christmas carolers or to the Shubert fans among us. In fact, it would be very interesting to compare this `Ave Maria' with that of Shubert and to determine the history of this particular title through the ages.This is a great change and relief for our Christmas listening after being drowned in `Silent Night' and `Away in the Manger'.A generous 68 minutes of a different kind of Christmas music. I have 14 of their CD's . This one is the best . Four exquisite voices , painstaking research , facinating liner notes , all of their music has this in common . What sets this apart is the clairity of the recording . Each of these ladies have amazing voices that come alive with a good set of speakers . All of the reverberations and harmonics are there , and in phase . Turn it up and listen to the crispness of each voice on every note . This is one of my favorite CD's of all time . I am relatively odd about Christmas music. I don't break out the Bing Crosby or Nat King Cole like everyone else. Instead I find that I like medieval stuff for Christmas. And this is about as perfect a Medieval Christmas album as you can ask for. The Anonymous 4 is a group of lovely female voices who, on this disc, sing the English medieval carols that made them famous initially. Put it on the CD with a roaring log fire and some Eggnog! Wonderful! Quite accidentally I discovered the Anonymous 4, thanks to the feature on Amazon.com that permits one to listen to an excerpt of the cd. I immediately became a big fan of this group.  Now I am disappointed that they split up, but I intend to collect all of their works.  An amazing talent. How do I get my money back?  CD won't play.  Nothing is wrong with my player - it plays all my other CDs The purity and perfection of tone in this collection makes the haunting selections a treat for anyone with a liking for mediaeval music. The Anonymous 4 reproduce chant exactly as it was intended to be done - not in an operatic style (and I am an opera buff!), but with the style of a mediaeval monastery.The beauty of this recording is such that I often use it during meditation and prayer - and what, after all, is Christmas about? For all those like me who, by December 23rd, are ready to have a full-blown screaming fit if they have to endure yet one more hackneyed round of ""O Holy Night,"" O, Little Town of Bethlehem,"" ""The Holly and the Ivy,"" ""Hark the Herald Angels,"" or ""Little Drummer Boy,"" this beautiful record is your soothing antidote. These haunting melodies--sung as if by angels and recorded beautifully--will transport you inside the stone walls of an abbey in medieval Europe, where Christmas music is solemnly devotional--not tacky, commercial, overdone muzak. ""On Yoolis Night"" made me want to pray and meditate in peace, revering the birth of the Messiah. Which is a whole lot nicer than wanting to throw that full-blown screaming fit. Highly recommended. 'On Yoolis Night' is a collection of motets, carols, hymns, antiphons  and a few other pieces in honour of the nativity - this is a medieval Christmas album.  During the Middle Ages, when Europe was swept with adoration of the Blessed Virgin Mary, many of the songs around Christmas would be as much around her character as with Jesus.  These works deal with the various legends, biblical and extra-canonical, as well as the traditional stories of Christmastide, primarily taken from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries.  However, the earliest piece dates from the fifth century (A solis ortus cardine) to the polyphony of the fifteenth century, which means that this disc in fact contains a thousand years of history.  Also included are a few anticipatory pieces from Advent, such as the Vox clara chant (the voice of him crying in the wilderness...).These are beautiful pieces, stunning in performance and quite remarkable - compared to modern Christmas carols, these are pieces with depth and richness, certainly devoid of much of the mercantile and later accretions that have overlaid holiday seasons in the Western world.This is definitely a holiday album with a difference.-- Liner Notes --This text accompaniment to this disc is very full, so much so that the booklet is not contained within the jewel case, but rather within a slipcover in which both the CD/jewel case and the booklet reside. The liner notes include a description of the work, a brief piece about the quartet, and the lyrics of the songs both in original language and in translation - all repeated in English, German, and French sections.-- Anonymous 4 --Contrary to the implication of their name, the Anonymous 4 are not anonymous. This is a vocal quartet made up of Ruth Cunningham, Marsha Genensky, Susan Hellauer, and Johanna Rose at the time of this recording (Ruth Cunningham will later go on to a solo career early, and another member will join - Jacqueline Horner). They came together as a formal group in 1986, and have been ensemble-in-residence at St. Michael's Church in New York City, giving concert series in New York as well as throughout North America. They have been featured a number of times on national media in North America as well as Germany. They then went on to yet more success, eventually performing more that 1000 concerts worldwide.Their specialty is working with chant, monophonic and polyphonic music, and working with medieval texts. According to one source, 'The group takes its name from an anonymous music theorist of the late 13th century, Anonymous IV, who is the principal source on the two famous composers of the Notre Dame school, L&eacute;onin and P&eacute;rotin.'The group ended a touring career of nearly two decades in 2004. This is a beautiful collection of music dedicated to the virgen mary.  For you're into this type of music, this is a must for your collection. I enjoy Anonymous 4 and if you like Medieval this is about as good as it gets.  I recommend this to all of us that both play and collect such. This is a wonderful album that I never get tired of listening to, even after several years of owning it.The arrangements and voices are absolutely beautiful, and I listen to it throughout the year as a calming background music. As Christmas nears it is a wonderful album to have on with the tree lights on and the room lights low. On Yoolis Night. Medieval Carols and Motets. Performed by Anonymous 4 (Ruth Cunningham, Martha Genensky, Susan Hellauer, Johanna Rose). Recorded in November, 1992, at the Campion Center, Boston, Massachussetts. Harmonia Mundi HMU 907099. Total time: 68'03"".Record companies who dare to publish CDs with medieval music are often glad if they can manage to sell a few hundred copies; this CD, the second by Anonymous 4, stormed to the top of the Billboard charts when it first appeared in 1993. And not because it compromised or attempted any kind of ""crossover"", but simply because both the music and the performance (four delightfully pure, unaccompanied, vibrato-less female voices: three sopranos and one alto) are so beautiful that even the uninitiated can catch something of the spirit of joy and peace that this disk captures so eminently well. Yes, there are seven pieces of Gregorian-type chant here, and chant was ""in"" during the early 90's, but my feeling is that it was probably the polyphonic motets and carols that made this recording an early music hit. The sound is difficult to describe; the only comparison that comes to mind is the swirling, many-voiced and often extremely beautiful, but also highly volatile, effect of ""singing in the spirit"" or ""sung glossalalia"" in some well-ordered charismatic and pentecostal churches where one can, on occasion, feel translated into heavenly regions. Much the same can be said of this disk, which, as one might imagine, contains exclusively Christian material from what are generally known as the ""Dark Ages"" from the 5th to the 15th centuries A. D. Well, judging purely by the music presented here, those ages were, perhaps, not so dark as we moderns sometimes imagine. And the Christmas texts sung here so deliciously by Anonymous 4 are, surprisingly, much less Mary-orientated and much more directed towards Jesus than those on, for example, ""An English Ladymass"" (the group's first CD), thus being a lot less offensive to my evangelical sensibilities and providing well over an hour of rapt listening, and that not only at Christmas time. Absolute five-star plus rating! I take this CD out only every once in a while because it's like a very rare, fine liquor -- you don't want to spoil it with too many tastings.The collection is both musically and spiritually rich. I played it while I was in labor with my son; it takes you outside yourself completely.If you like a cappella, chant, medieval sounds -- this is among the best CDs you can buy, bar none. I don't write many reviews, but I'm amazed that this CD's garnered only two so far, so here I am. I realize that there are muscians (including friends) who are not fond of  the Anonymous 4 because of their &quot;head sound&quot; and lack of  vibrato.  I have also attended lectures that said that is what makes them  &quot;authentic&quot;.  Fortunately, I am not a musician and can simply say  I don't care, I enjoy their sound.Even more than their voices, I  appreciate their digging into old manuscripts and resurrecting excellent  but forgotten pieces.  The plainchant on this cd is taken from a 13th  century antiphoner from Worcester.  The remainder of the music is also  English but polyphonic.The acrostic hymn A solis ortus cardine is  included with only its Christmas portion;  the carols all have refrains  (part of the distinction made here between carols and songs) and are from  the 14th-15th century.  There are five motets in traditional style.  In  short, despite the restrictions of time and place, the cd is varied.This  is a top notch album of traditional Christmas music - the chant and  polyphony encouraged by the liturgical documents for use in the Latin Rite  Catholic Church.  This album shows why it is worth keeping as an active  tradition. Sweet, lovely, soothing beauty!  This music fills your home with lightness and poetry, and evokes a spirit of peace.I would urge everyone, not just medievalists and classical music fans, to listen to this album.  It has a power and a softness which can rival any holiday music around.  OK--for my holiday party, it's got to be ""Hipster's Holiday,"" but for the morning, for quiet times, for solstice tranquility, there is nothing quite like this album.Take a chance on it--you'll be very glad you did. The Anonymous 4 did a splendid job!  This CD was recorded In November 1992 at the Campion Center In Boston, MA.  Brad Michel, the engineer, did a great job recording these songs in three days.  Read the 78 page booklet when you get a chance.  These beautiful songs are from English sources of the 13th through 15th centuries (per booklet).I love it! Several years ago, I bought &quot;The New Oxford Book of Christmas Carols&quot;, and I immediately set out to find some of the rarer songs.  While in the music store, I ran across On Yoolis Night.  Thank goodness, I  bought it, and went home to listen to some of the most incredible Christmas  music I have ever heard.  The true power behind this album is that is  focuses on the spiritual meaning of Christmas, and the harmonies of the  four singers are incredible.  If you have never been exposed to midieval  music, it can be a bit startling at first, but the sweet purity of the  voices are completely timeless.  After being innundated every Christmas  with canned Xmas Muzak, treat yourself to the auditory feast of On Yoolis  Night. This is actually the second time I have purchased this CD.  I loaned it to a friend and never got it back, yet it is an integral part of my Christmas celebration.  I wanted to have it in my music library.  These four voices are so beautiful, and evoke images of stone cathedrals and candles.  The music gives me a chance to experience the past, in new and glorious ways.  I highly recommend it as an antidote to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.","Noels,Vocal Pop,Classical,Pop,Holiday & Wedding,Motets,Opera & Classical Vocal,Lullabies & Berceuse,Vocal Non-Opera,Christmas",gift friend well received yoolis night performed quartet anonymous another collection works dedicated worship virgin mary medieval england unlike english ladymass lammas ladymass like incidental christmas season subtitle states medieval carols motets thus comprise complete mass little polyphony much singing unison chanting six old middle english may much understandable modern ear latin seven works described carols including one entitled ave maria one known either neighborhood christmas carolers shubert fans among us fact would interesting compare ave maria shubert determine history particular title ages great change relief christmas lis gift friend received night performed quartet anonymous collection works dedicated worship virgin virgin mary mary medieval medieval england england english lammas incidental christmas christmas season season states medieval carols motets comprise complete mass polyphony singing unison chanting old middle middle english english understandable modern ear latin works described carols including entitled ave known neighborhood christmas carolers fans fact interesting compare ave shubert determine history title ages great change relief christmas lis
282,580,B0000007PC,"i thought this was a combination of punk and puke meets hair and metal and the finish product is punk rock at its finest!  the drums on this record was fast and talented and all the songs made you sing along with it after  you heard this album a few tymes Fabulous debut album by the group from Santa Barbara.  Hard, driven scores with a attenention grabbing riffs.  Some comedic ballads, &quot;Mr. Coffee,&quot; and &quot;Lagwagon.&quot;  Overall, a must have for any punk rock CD collection. This CD, in my opinion, is the gnarliest CD of punk, the brumming is perfection and the talent in this band is unbelievable! You should buy this CD if you like punk, because this is as good as it gets! To me, i always hear this album and think that Lagwagon must have started out as a hair metal band (look at the pictures inside!), somehow fell into the punk scene, and took it from there.  If you're only familiar with  Lagwagon's new stuff, this will surprise you, in a good way.  But if you've  never heard Lagwagon before, I suggest you get Hoss first. Yeah, This Lagwagon CD is almost too good.  There are heavy riffs and wonderful melodies.  ""Angry Days"" is one of the best on the CD.  If mainstream radio ever heard this, it would blow up.  But we wouldn't want that.  ""Mr Coffee"" is alright, kind of goofey.  ""Beer Goggles"" is an anthematic drinking song with the best drumming in the world.  Go Out and Get this CD!!!!!! I absolutely love this cd!  I used to think it was weird because it was harder back when the only thing I listened to was nothing but pop-punk stuff.  But now that my musical tastes have developed a bit more I now realize how great this cd actually is.  The drumming on this cd is absolutely amazing!(i'm a drummer myself)  I don't even have to mention how good the rest of the band is.  My personal favorite tracks are stop whining, and beer goggles. I didn't really like this cd, Let's just say it wasn't my cup o' tea. I heard this was there best album, so I bought it, not hearing any of the songs on here. But I actually bought it used for about 4 bucks, so I guess it was worth it. There were a few catchy songs on here like 'Angry days' and 'Mr. Coffee'. But I don't like this CD that much, I can see why other people could, because they are very talented, the drumming is awesome. I actually like later Lagwagon better... I really like this album. Its not the same style as the newer ones, but it is still pure Wagon. There are fewer polyphonic guitar melodies, but the album compensates with solid rythems and SICK drumming (of course). I would  say that this album is more &quot;punk&quot; than the others. I reccomend  it. i think this came out the same time as &quot;the longest line&quot;(nofx) just as fat records was kicking off.a few listens and you are completely hooked.listen out for fat mike singing on mr coffee. so what if some people think this cd sounds similar to nofx.  If you like the cd you should be happy and people have been copying the wheel for centuries I dont see how this is any diferent.  Anyway this cd has an unrefined sound to most of the songs that not only make it a good change of pace but also make it more apparent this was there first cd.  I personally like 8 of the songs my favorite being angry days.  I got a lot of buddies who should listen to this especially the part about never working for a cent.  Hey though if that sounds like you dont start anytime soon though workings no fun take my advice.  Beer goggles is definately worth mentioning too.  It is highly original and humorus.  Noble end, child inside, parents guide to living, foiled again and tragic vision are real good.  Bury the hatchet is good cause most everyone had a friend or knows of someone who had a friend who split up in a similar fashion. I thought that I had all of Lagwagon's discs, but I had never heard of this one.  So, I got it, and it is great.  It also has a great cover of ""Bad Moon Rising."" Duh is a great punk cd thats more in the hardcore era than the newer melodic punk of Lagwagon, i think the main stand out on this cd are the intense lyrics from start to finish they are great even the crazy ones such as beer goggles and Mr coffee (one of my favourites). Seriously if you are a punk whos into Lagwagon this is one of the stand out punk cds that should be in your record collection. Check out inspector gadjet aswell thats just awesome, Duh seems to concentrate more on the hardcore element of punk than there newer more melodic material even if you arent a fan of hardcore punk you will like this as it's more melodic hardcore punk and has the original Lagwagon sound all over it. Duh is full of inspirational and insightful lyrics that are brilliant alone without the music but when you combine the music it's not far off perfect, i'm sure alot of people wont be as keen on Duh but it does represent the birth of a great punk band and the die hard Lagwagon fan should definatley own this and as for anybody new to Lagwagon i would recommened Hoss or Leftovers to Duh. The band tried to stick with the punk on Duh with them joining fat and nearly all the metal that they used to play is not on this record so it's pretty much just a high octane punk album that maintains it's quality throughout. The stand out tracks are Angru days, Mr Coffee, of mind and matter and inspector gadjet. For a first album aswell this is quality especially with them been the joint first band on fat along with NoFx. The only real draw back on the cd is the cover of John Foggertys bad moon rising but you can easily skip one track. Amazon's got is wrong.  Duh came out in 1992 not 1994...Trashed came out in 1994.  See-ya. Punk slash metal. Don't worry, more punk than anything.  Lagwagon has remained a staple of my listening diet for a good while now and it all started with this powerful cd.  It has everything, humorous sound bites, an  awsome cover of Bad Moon Rising, thick guitar, killer drums, and the  overall perfection of a thight sounding punk band.  The band has deffinitly  grown sense this cd and they just keep getting better, but this is a must  have for punk fans in general.  &quot;All aboard the lagwagon&quot; I bought this cd because one of my friends liked them and I figured that there was a reason why.  So I picked it up, thinking that Lagwaggon would rule and stuff.  Nope.  This album is just bad music.  Sure Angry Days is  listenable, and the remake of Bad Moon Rising is novel, but other then  that, save your money.  I hear that newer Lagwaggon stuff is good.  But  I've been scorn for life from this cd. This is my first exposure to Lagwagon, and I have to say that I am hooked. Anyone who's into punk should check this out. This is by far the best Lagwagon album in my opinion. The sound and the rawness of the songs makes it feel real. That's a very good cd, like other Lag Wagon cd's . I bought it when I known Lag Wagon since 1 year, and I thought that it's a cool punk cd, there are a lot of good song, like: Angry days, Mr. Coffee, and the  funny:Inspector Gadget, if you like Lag Wagon, buy it.","Alternative Rock,Punk Revival,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore & Punk,Punk-Pop",thought combination punk puke meets hair metal finish product punk rock finest drums record fast talented made sing along heard tymes fabulous debut group santa barbara hard driven scores attenention grabbing riffs comedic ballads quot mr coffee quot quot lagwagon quot overall must punk rock cd collection cd opinion gnarliest cd punk brumming perfection talent band unbelievable buy cd like punk good gets always hear think lagwagon must started hair metal band look pictures inside somehow fell punk scene took youre familiar lagwagons new stuff surprise good way youve never heard lagwagon suggest get hos thought combination punk puke meets hair hair metal metal finish product punk punk rock rock drums record fast sing sing along heard fabulous debut group santa barbara barbara hard driven scores grabbing riffs comedic ballads mr mr coffee coffee quot quot lagwagon quot overall punk punk rock rock cd collection cd opinion cd punk perfection talent band unbelievable buy cd punk good hear think lagwagon started hair hair metal hair metal band metal metal band band look pictures fell punk punk scene scene youre familiar lagwagons new stuff surprise good way heard suggest hos
283,581,B0000007PF,"Classic NoFX. Simple album, only a couple of songs, but every one of them is worth listening to over and over again. This is one of my favorite albums and has many songs that they perform live. If you're a NoFX fan this is one that you have to have for your collection. If you're looking for a good full length NoFX album I recommend either Ribbed or Punk In Drublic. I discovered NoFX at the tender age of 17 when I was in full blown teenage-angst phases coupled with the need-to-be-different deficit that most teenagers suffer from...;) Hence, NoFX with their fast, hard punk sound were perfect for my needs!The longest line was released in 1992 on the Fat Wreck Chords label, and was (and still is) one my favourite of all their releases to date. Although only an EP, it really is NoFX at their absolute best!The five tracks are superbly performed by the current NoFX line-up of Erik Sandin (drums), Eric Melvin (guitar), Fat Mike (bass, vox) and El Hefe (guitar). I saw them live last year in Manchester, at which Mike pointed out that their latest album wasn't as good as Punk In Drublic. Well I would be sure it isn't as good as this EP!Overall this EP is a must for any NoFX fan, and a compliment to any collection of this genre. El Hefe's first appearance on a NOFX cd!!!!!!  Thank God!!!!!  Great  disc.  Fat Mike's voice still had a little maturing to do but still sounds  great.  Death Of John Smith is still one of NOFX's best songs ever.  BUY  THIS ALBUM!!!!! First of all, before I go any further, if you don't have this CD, get it. It's not too expensive and it's one of the best EPs out there. Death of John Smith and Kill All the White Man are some of NOFX's best songs. It seems like for some reason NOFX tends to give it more in their EPs than LPs (though their last few, inc. Pump Up the Valuum, Heavy Petting Zoo, Punk in Drublic, etc. were any better they would have created a paradox in the universe that would destroy the world or something). Anyway, I'm done rambling. Get this cd now! Wow, what can I say? All 5 songs are great, not 1 that is sub par. The Longest Line is a fantastic song, only second to The Decline, just wish it were a bit longer (as I do all of their songs). Can't go wrong with this CD, its great all around. if kill all the white men had not been on this ep then i would have give it 5 stars.there are 4 of the best tracks ever by any band,then the last one is such a let down.this is when nofx were in their prime..great stuff. This is my favorite nofx album:1.The Death of John Smith-10/102.The Longest Line-10/103.Stranded-10/104.Remnants-10/105.Kill all the White Man-10/10 The Longest Line introduced NOFX's newest member El Hefe. Hefe added great talent to the band with great chops on lead guitar, lead vocals, backing harmonies, and trumpet solos.This EP contains two songs that could easily fit in any NOFX fan's top ten list: The Death of John Smith and The Longest Line. This EP is a must for any true NOFX fan or anyone in search for a good punk recording. The cover art alone is worth the price.Furthermore, this EP is the turning point in NOFX's career it is where they developed their characteristic sound that can be found on later full length releases.Cheers. Enjoy This is one of my favorite album by NOFX. I first heard the longest line when I was drooling over the keys of my computer. I fell in love at first sound. So I thought that It might be nice to go out and buy it. So I did. I listened to the whole Cd, and I was amazed. I couldn't stop listening. I own most of their albums but to this day this one is my favorite. If you are interested in good music, Buy this album. Thanks for listening to me blab. LaterVOLCOM for life! Their best work and its an EP!!  Can't go wrong with any song on this album. Short and sweet, `The Longest Line' was recorded as an excuse for NOFX to show off their new guitar player El Hefe. Having played in a few other bands, and also appearing in the movie ""The Bad News Bears"" as a child, El Hefe came to NOFX with a big rep. NOFX meanwhile had been trying in vain to drop any Metal inferences and influences from their sound, and a trumpet playing guitarist seemed the obvious way to finish off the misleading Metal references.The difference in sound between this and previous album `Ribbed' is not immediately apparent. On first impression, ""The Death Of John Smith"" could easily have been lifted from that album, but then a melodic passage, which wouldn't have fit earlier material pops up, providing a contrast to NOFX's straight forward So-Cal Punk sound.Fat Mike's vocals were far less melodic than on later albums. His slightly nasal, slightly off key voice can grate at times. His lyrics though were beginning to take on an insightfulness not previously shown, exploring the hopelessness of a nine-to-five existence with an edge of cynicism and sarcasm.El Hefe finally steps up on closing track ""Kill All The White Man"", suddenly adding a trumpet and a Reggae sound never heard before from the band. The seemingly happy, almost funky little melody led by Fat Mike's bass, ironically underscores a slave's lament as to his hopeless plight. Hefe sings too, with a more mellow voice than Fat Mike, and punctuates his verses with trumpet bursts. The band kick out the jams for a traditional Punk finale to the EP.Recorded as an experiment, with a couple of throwaway tracks, `The Longest Line' pointed where NOFX were heading, as the band's song writing improved and diversified. It was a blueprint for a winning formula. This is one of the best EPs ever made by NOFX and the crazy thing is that it is also one of their first ones. You will not regret getting this album. My favorite song in it is definitely the first song called The Death of John Smith. This song is just simply amazing but the rest of the EP is also really good. Truthfully, if you look at NOFX's work previous to The longest line, you will notice that it is pretty much trashy punk rock. This album is their first to use vocal harmonies (except for on S&amp;M Airlines, but they were helped out by Mr. Brett)  and has revolutionized their music writing ever since (thank you El Hefe!).  This EP has generated their path towards more melodic/goofy/political punk rock.  I advise any punk rocker to purchase this EP, after all, it really isn't that expensive. The longest line has to be the best nofx song ever and kill all the white man is good too. so yeah this is a great record. thats pretty much it...dont be fooled by the price here...its actually A LOT cheaper anywhere else...expecially if you buy it from nofx themselves like i did...it was 5 bucks...i got it like 3 years ago at the warped tour..and i listened to it all the way home which was a two hour drive...its just that good...","Alternative Rock,Punk Revival,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore & Punk,Punk-Pop",classic nofx simple couple every one worth listening one favorite many perform live youre nofx fan one collection youre looking good full length nofx recommend either ribbed punk drublic discovered nofx tender age full blown teenage angst phases coupled need different deficit teenagers suffer hence nofx fast hard punk sound perfect needs longest line released fat wreck chords label still one favourite releases date although ep really nofx absolute best five superbly performed current nofx line erik sandin drums eric melvin guitar fat mike bass vox el hefe guitar saw live last year manchester mike pointed th classic simple couple worth listening favorite perform live youre fan collection youre looking good full full length length recommend ribbed punk discovered tender age full blown teenage teenage angst angst phases coupled need different deficit teenagers suffer fast hard punk sound perfect needs line released fat fat wreck fat wreck chords wreck chords label favourite releases date ep really absolute best superbly performed current line erik erik sandin drums eric melvin guitar fat bass vox guitar saw live last year year mike pointed
284,582,B0000007PI,"Propagandhi  : How to Clean everything, i received shortly after my purchase. The price was very good! The CD plays excellent without any skips or any flaws! It was perfect!Thanks, AnarchoKid99 Propagandhi's album How to Clean Everything has everything you could ever want in a punk cd.  Fast catchy songs, lots of swearing, politically driven lyrics, and long song titles.  Gotta get this cd, it is one of my  favourites and you won't be dissapointed.  Easily one of the best Fat bands  out there, and likely one of the greatest punk bands on the planet. How can I ever begin to discuss an album I've listened to for more than half my life?  I love Propagandhi.  They were one of the best punk bands in the 90s yet since they're from Canada never got too huge.  They are amazing! Propagandhi has to be one of the most hard hitting, political punk rockers to date. This album has everything, great guitar, different sound and exellent lyrics. One thing they have going for them is the anger and will to send their message at you as fast and as hard as they can to make it stick. In my opinion, this album reinstates everything punk is about. Great CD! I wanted a blast from my past and this was it. I am a fan of punk rock music and I was happy to find this little gem on Amazon. This is one of my favorite albums but it's not on a political level because I think these guys are morons. I was baffled at reviews and people said they had &quot;intelligent&quot; lyrics. They must be the same people that think PunkVoter.com isn't a mind control device. It's seems to me any time a band makes a political statement they are consider to be smart. This is a fun album with great anthems to sing along to. But please this is not intelligent; Bad Religion is, not this.Anyway this a great album for anyone into modern punk and ska music; it's great fun. I have never written a review for anything in my entire life, but i think &quot;how to clean everything&quot; by Propagandhi is worthy of my praise. This cd is Propagandhi's best work by far. every song is awesome. i dont think i have ever heard a better cd in my life (although &quot;punk in drublic&quot; by nofx is close). If you like hard agressive punk you will love this cd. dont take my word for it, buy it! Best songs: antimanifesto, head? chest? or foot?, middle finger response, and the very best &quot;showdown&quot; Yes it is!!......this one is definitely in my list of most intense punk album! Along with ""Punk In Drublic"" by NOFX and  ""Demmamussabebonk"" by SNUFF, this little 12 track LP should bring you nothing but PURE PLEASURE!!!!!The riffs are very aggressive and melodic at the same time, very catchy, probably their bests in carreer!  I like Chris's voice on that album too!! It was back in 1993 so there is a big difference with their newest stuff but it still the same crazy energy!!From the outstanding  ska/punk-ish  opening track ""Anti-Manifesto"" to the very last song "" i want you to want me"", this album is totally rocking!! . Of course anyone familiar with Propagandhi  knows that they are talking about sensible topics that may be shocking for some people to say the least, the lyrics are an important part of the record but i think the music should come first. The album also has a very ""Humoristic ""tone to it, songs like "" ska sucks"" which is a ska song  and  "" this might be satire"" are a good example.For punk fans that never heard the album or never heard of the band, i would strongly suggest you go and get this as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed. This album is far from being dark and should  make you love it from the first spin. Also check for LESS TALK MORE ROCK which was the follow-up, its another very good album. SUPPORTING CASTE is there latest album and i would describe the sound as being similar to 1000 Atomic bombs detonating together!! Its a more serious sound but it still delivers!!!!......... Propagandhi  Rocks!!!!....ENJOY!!!! If someone says NOFX sucks its safe to say they suck. Ska Sucks is one of their best songs and there are lot of other great songs on here to boot. I bet this moron listens to Fallout Boy. I'll say this first: I love Propagandhi.  I think they're a great band.This album, though, is a rather generic early effort.  They barely knew how to play their instruments then, and it shows.  I challenge listeners to try to tell apart some of the songs on this album from NOFX (the band that got them signed).  John Samson's vocal tracks are weakened by his decidedly un-punk voice; he fits in much better with The Weakerthans.  The cover of Cheap Trick's ""I Want You To Want Me"" earns them kudos for sincerity, which is a Propagandhi hallmark: they don't beat around the bush.The political content is sometimes vague but always provocative.  They seem to get down to specific issues much more on their later two albums.Overall, I have to say, unless you're a diehard punk or activist music fan, this probably isn't what you're looking for. Best price I have seen for this album in forever. If you are on the fence about this: don't be. It might be the best punk album ever. This cd sucks. They are total ripoffs of NOFX (and NOFX sucks) and appear to put no effort into most of their songs. They all sound the same, the drummer sucks, and the vocals are stereotypically bad. The back cover of their ""funny"" faces is lame and makes me ashamed to own this. At least I didn't pay for it. I do like Anti-Manifesto though. i first heard this band in 1995.  i had been listening to NOFX and rancid and face to face and some other pop punk bands.  this cd blew me away.  forget that the lyrics back somewhat silly politics.  they are extremely  clever and the music is incredibly well written.  harmonies that would make  bach proud.  buy it. My cousin was listening to this band one day and i thought they were angry and bad but then i picked up this cd and i really liked it.  Even though it's not the best place to get your political veiws from, this band still helped me form some opinions.  The music is great to, its fast and catchy, i also really enjoy the singing and lyrics to.  Theres some fast punk, ska, pop/punk, its just a great album all together.  If you enjoy political stuff and fast punk/pop/punk then you well definantly enjoy this cd. This isn't my favorite CD by Propagandhi, but it's still pretty good.  Perfect for pissed-off wannabe punks, and smart but sometimes goofy lyrics for the rest of us.  My favorite track on this is a cover song.  Sure to offend your favorite fascist.  Or your grandma. Let me start by saying i hate all those reviews that i read off the main page for this album, you are all off. And I don't know how that one reviewer said theres pop/ska/ blah blah (not an exact quote), especialy with their song Ska Sucks. That is very offensive to a Propagandhi fan.Now my oppinion, This album is fantastic. It came at just the right time in my life, when i was questioning not only my government but my religion. The views are strong and extreme but there's nothing wrong with that. Great songs yelling out their oppinion on the government, that perhaps we shouldn't simply be following what we've been told, to question things, also there views on womens rights, and the way they are seen (by many men) as ""F*** Machines"" and of course the lyrics from Showdown along those same lines. They've been questioning these things so they can state them as strongly as they want. And to that one reviewer who said they arn't intelligent, they are very, i suppose the less intelligent may not see the intelligence but it's there. Get past them yelling F*** this that you love and F*** that that you love and you'll see they are very smart.That's it, great album, great views, great lyrics, great speed guitar, great sound, Great Band. I love it.I don't think i followed the guidelines to specifically so I will be surprised to see this review posted.  ;) I just don't get it. These so called ""Punks"" sound like nothing more than NOFX wannabes. Except NOFX has more talent and a lot more orignal sounding. These guys have horrible lyrics. I just don't get how these guys go the reputation they've got as the best politcal punk band of the decade just because they can say ""F*** Religion"" 8 or 9 times in a song. They don't know about anything. They are insulting to all politically sound persons in the world. They shouldn't have quit their day jobs, whatever those jobs were. The song ""Ska Sux"" is especially stupid and insulting and just proves that the(y) know nothing about music.You want real punk? Try some of the following: Dead Kennedys, NOFX, Rancid, Operation Ivy, Blitz, U.S. Bombs, Dropkick Murphys, Sex Pistols, The Business, Bad Brains, Gorilla Biscuits, Minor Threat, TSOL, and the Germs (just to name a few). Although I like Less Talk and Todays Empires a little better, this is still a great cd by Propagandhi.Its a little more edgy than the rest of their cd's. When I first bought Propagandhi's &quot;Less Talk, More Rock&quot;, I thought I had discovered the cure to anything and everything wrong with this planet. These guys are seriously brilliant and have strong, well  thought out beliefs to back them up. The lyrics are genius, and the music  is outsanding. Song #4 is possibly the greatest anthem to rejecting the  establishment I've ever heard. Buy this and buy &quot;Less Talk, More  Rock&quot;. Read the lyrics and you will be a better person for doing so. An amazing album to say the least. Although Propagandhi likes to seperate itself from any distinct category, this is one of the best punk albums of all time. How many other bands can claim that they can carry a message, be funny and play an amazing song all at the same time? This is what puts Propagandhi a cut above the rest. Many other bands carry a political message, but Propagandhi manages to put it into an amazing song, unlike the over-aggressive tunes of other bands (Anti-flag). Overall definately a solid album, but, surprisingly, not Propagandhi's best! I really don't like punk. I'm more into heavy metal and hardcore. This band, however, stands out from the rest. This doesn't mean that this music is harder or different than the next punk band. It's still the standard 3 or 4 chord songs. At the same time, this is still pretty in your face. The singer is very blatant with what he is singing about and leaves no question to what a song was about unless you're completely clueless. And, the things he says in these songs NEED to be said. The thing I love about this band is the fact that it's clear that he has no regard for so-called ""moral absolutes"" and he tells it like he wants to tell it regardless of whether or not they have ""crossed the line"". These guys are not afraid to cross that line. ""Stick the [blanking]flag...."" and ""Haille Sailasse...."" are pure proof of this. In addition to the complaint of the music being too ""punky"" for my taste although it's supposed to be, they also could've done without the Letters To Cleo cover. I will admit that when I first heard this album over a decade ago I though they sounded exactly like NOFX. But I was new to the punk scene and hadn't listen to much.Now I have come to truly love and appreciate this album.In this age of Pop-punk, Emo, and the other garbage that is all the scene (I admit some is OK, Ex:Two Gallants). It is utterly refreshing to hear some punk with just the right blend of guts, purpose, and melody.Be warned, this band is left of left, but at least they are passionate and thoughtful, so just make your own judgements about their statements and enjoy the rock. This album rocks!  By far the best of their work.  Anyone who says that this album sucks is a dumbass! This is an awesome political punk album; the lyrics are biting and well written and the fast punk kicks @ss.  The talking vocal style also works very well on this album. Well this release came out in '94, & yes it's still good many years later. No doubt it made a big impression over in Sweden, because one year later, the punk band ""Randy"" switched from playing ska tunes, to releasing the BEST punk rock CD of all time! It was titled; There's No Way We're Gonna Fit In. They used Propagandi's formula,,,cranked it up a bit (really!), & executed it to punk perfection. Originally released on Dolores Recs, then rereleased on Burning Heart Recs (both are Swedish labels). Long outta print, used copies are going for big $$. Find it, listen to it,,,you'll be blown away, 'nuff said. That might be a bold statement, in light of releases by greats such as The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and NOFX, just to name a few; however, this is a bold album, and it deserves proper recognition.  I listened to it tonight for the first time in oh, about ten years, and remembered instantly why I loved it so much (as a rebellious teenager); it f___ing rules, end of story.  The music is perfect; incredibly ingenuitive considering the style (as good as or better than comparable metal music (which I associate it most closely with, rather than ""punk""...though it's technically ""hardcore punk,"" ""popcore,"" or ""punkcore,"" I suppose) of its time), relentlessly a__-kicking, and flawlessly performed by highly talented musicians (especially considering the genre).  All of this is a perfect background for the highly volatile lyrics that anti-preach everything from saluting the (Canadian) flag to Rastafarian culture to capitalism/consumerism to homophobia.  There was a time when I listened to this album virtually non-stop...basically between the ages of 13 and 18.  It just never got old...and listening to it again now, I could easily continue doing so endlessly again.  It's simply flawless, easily the best Fat Wreck Chords release ever, and probably one of the top three punk albums ever, if not number one (I'd say it most evenly competes with NOFX's ""Punk in Drublic"" and Lagwagon's ""Duh""...ok, maybe ""Nevermind the Bollocks..."" was more important, in retrospect, but come on...musically, its simplicity was overstated (and overrated)).  If you've never experienced any ""punkcore"" (call it whatever you want, really...I don't care), this is the perfect place to start...why save the best for last?  I myself am a die-hard metalhead, and generally don't like ""punk"" music because it's not musically challenging and is generally nothing more than pre-teen rage unleashed upon the world specifically for other raging pre-teenagers...but this album far exceeds the typical boundaries of the ""punk"" genre it resides in, and deserves to be...no, must be recognized as what it is: a simply fantastic album!P.s.  Ska Sucks! Propagandhi are a welcome relief from throwaway, `humorous', so-called `punk' bands, in both their hard style and their intelligent lyrics. They have a less polished, more jagged, and indeed more original sound than most of their Fat Wreck labelmates, which provides the canvas for some of the most edgy and angry vocals you'll hear on any punk album. Propagandhi's furious lyrics and dissenting opinions are probably as well known as their music itself; for me, the anger and bile adds greatly to the feel of the record. The band convey their thoughts in the most forthright, uncompromising manner, preferring wordy verses to instantly memorable slogans (see Rage Against the Machine). As melodramatic as it may sound, Propagandhi have the passion, intelligence and inspiration to make you change the way you look at the world - and that is a very, very rare quality for a band these days. I don't think that this is as good as `Less Talk, More Rock', which gets their political ideas and message across much clearer, but it is still worth owning. There are too many good songs on `How to Clean Everything' to mention here - but if you like punk rock at all you should listen to this. This cd is hard to get into, but its f**king awesome. I think if you want to get into it quickly listen to number 4, it has a sweet guitar riff that just makes you wanna jump around. This isn't your whiney pop-punk blink 182, this is pure punk! Propagandhi are a relief from the to many whiney pop-punk bands out there. Propaghandi have ""smash the state"" written all over them and they want to be taken seriously rather than branded as another generic NOFX-wannabe band. How to Clean Everything accomplishes more than escaping the carbon-copy labeling -- it also puts their message on a high pedestal so it can be heard loud and clear. And in the mitts of all the ""throwing the monkey wrench in the system"" rants, they still have a little fun at the expense of all the bubble gum pop-punk bands that flood the market and even their own label. Yes there are alot of good pop-punk bands, but if you're going to right love songs, be mature in your writing. Anyway Propagandhi isn't just one of the crude, humorous, so-called punk bands (not that it is a bad thing, but it gets old), in both their hard style and their intelligent lyrics. They have a less polished, more jagged, and indeed more original sound than most of their Fat Wreck labelmates, which provides the canvas for some of the most edgy and angry vocals you'll hear on any punk album. This album, though, is a rather generic early effort. They barely knew how to play their instruments then, and it shows, and I also challenge listeners to try to tell apart some of the songs on this album from NOFX. They are pretty similar and in some ways they are highly original. Propaghandi aren't afraid to show the world that a government coup can be fun and educational at the same time. Buy this CD, it just plain ROCKS! First of all, I'd like to say I'm pretty sick of bratty ass punk kids spewing rhetoric to make themselves think they're smarter than everyone else simply because they read. Learn some humility. Secondly, I'm writing this review after years of being a fan, and listening to all their subsequent albums. Just recently, after a fresh play of 'Potemkin City Limits', I got nostalgic for the ol' 'How To Clean Everything', some of my first exposure to political music. Now, when I listen back on Propagandhi, it's much more appearant that THEN, they were younger versions of the band NOW, not the other way around (obvious, no crap, but hear me out). Even though the band has gone through some drastic changes (the drummer now being the only original member), the stance and goal of the music remains strangely identical, almost as if 'Propagandhi' is a state of mind, not just a band. Then, they sound like the same I'm-in-your-face-because-you're-a-stupid-capitalist-American-and-it's-mainly-because-of-some-book-my-friend-lent-me-and-I-have-no-real-ideas-of-my-own brat punk kids who want to complain about how things are screwed up, yet offer no real solutions. Except, Propagandhi grew up. And it shows in their new music. That's why I love this CD so much. Whereas so many bands sound like boring, tired, old versions of their younger selves, it seems like Propagandhi knew from the very beginning what and where they wanted to be, they just knew they weren't there yet. Ever since has been a learning experience for them, and it shows in their development. If you look back on this album, you can hear Chris Hannah wanting to find a solution, just not knowing it, and not knowing how to articulate it.  Instead of the typical teenage reply ""F**k you, I know everything"", this album screams ""No, I don't know, but we'll find out and come back smarter. So, F**k you."" A great primer for the kid who honestly wants to make the world better, not just bitching about it how it sucks, and then squirting his shorts because he thinks he's subvertly insulting you by reminding you how much you paid for everything.

285,584,B0000007PO,"i really just can say one thing bout this cd. its greatthis is really, really greatlagwagon is sure on of the greatest schoolpunk band ever, and they prove it well on his cd u can play it when youre down, or when its party all night long, or whenever. none of the songs sux, but rock. well this is lagwagons best, but the other is great to cannot really understand why hoss was their breakthrough cause this is, well, i dont know. lagwagon has their own style at first i thought it was like nofx but i changed my mind i just cant stop listen to it I feel I am not really qualified to rate this CD, I am too biased against punk in general, so I will give it an average rating.Listening to the preview for the cover of ""Brown Eyed Girl,"" has depressed me completely.  Punk takes all the rhythm out of music and replaces it with just hard chord strumming.  The song was a beautiful song as it was, ""punkifying"" it completely destroyed it, it sounds like it would if someone knew the melody to the vocal part of the song, but the rest of the band hadn't touched instruments before, or are playing the wrong song in the background.  Look at it this way, I don't get any stirring when I listen to this, it sounds like a bunch of egotistical young conformists jacking off.  You don't tap your feet or want to get up and dance, there is no feeling or beat behind it.  It sounds like they think to themselves while playing this: ""Ha, we sound so good, just like everybody else thinks is cool now, and we're hot, we're so bad ass, yeah, oh my god, we're sooooo cool, whoa!  Yeah, dude, this version is sooo much better than the original!""  When Van sung it, he put his soul into it, and you can tell.  He wasn't worried about his hair gel, he was worried about making good music, and he was enjoying playing and singing.Or perhaps I am missing something. This is one of their best cd's! The focus alot more on their guitars which is rad, the cd style is punk as you can get and you will not regret buying this cd! Buy it, and if you skate you'll love this cd, or you should. Although I am not yet a diehard LagWagon fan, I found this album to be nothing short of incredible. Everything in it is great; the guitars are fast and heavy yet melodic. The drums set a very good pace for the album, and lyrically this is one of the best punk albums ever made. They are funny at times, but at the same time a great level of maturity and insight is displayed through the words.I also do not think that LagWagon sounds terribly similar to NOFX. I own just about every NOFX album made, and none of the songs on this CD sound a bit like anything from NOFX. LagWagon has a very unique sound, and this album is a perfect example of what exactly it is. You won't stop listening to it once you get it; it never gets old. Just buy it. If you dont really like the pop sound of Lets Talk About Feelings, This is worthe getting. Some of Lagwagon's best stuff, One of there greatest albums. My favorites on this cd are Lazy,Stokin' The Neighbors,Know it All, and Whipping Boy This is the best Lagwagon album, it's kinda old school but that's where all the hardcore stuff comes from. Lagwagon still need to put more tracks to a CD but this is the most packed and worthy buy you can make. Best tracks &quot;Lazy&quot; and &quot;Rust&quot;. One of my top 10 punk albums next to pennywise - full circle. This is one of Lagwagon's strongest albums, and the perfect representation of melodic punk.  Fans of Pennywise, Good Riddance, No Use For A Name, and pretty much any other Epitaph or Fat Wreck Chords band, should give this CD  a shot. Lagwagon, in my opinion, is not only THE greatest punk band of all time, but on of the greates bands of all time. Trashed or Duh! would have to be the best albums. This is overall a great release...out of 10:Island Of Shame: 8Lazy : 7.5Know It All: 7Stokin' The Neighbors: 8.5Give It Back: 8.5Rust: 7.5Goin' South: 4Dis'Chords: 8Coffee and Cigarettes: 9.5Brown Eyed Girl: 8.5 (probably the best BEG cover ever.)Whipping Boy: 8No One: 9.5Bye For Now: 9Back One Out: 4If you are just getting into Lagwagon, this and hoss are a must buy...wich will lead you into buying Duh! .. then all of the other albums. BUY IT NOW! Lag Wagon is one of those 3rd wave bands that appeared bearing the influences of NOFX + Bad Religion + random Metal bands. Others included stand out groups in this vein included Strung Out, Propagandhi, Ten Foot Pole, and the like.In my opinion, Lag Wagon was at the very top of this heap (sharing the crown with Propaganhdi) and this is their best album, deserving recognition for taking the typical NOFX sound and innovating it to the point that they superseded their predecessors. In my opinion, you can hear Lag Wagon's influence on NOFX's sound after the release of their debut album, but who really knows.The only other band to truly innovative the 'NOFX sound' in my opinion was Propagandhi on their debut ""How to clean everything"", which, as far as punk classics go, is on the same level as this release (if not better in some ways).In short, this album rules, get it, experience the evolution of a sound that had its moment, but for now no longer has any bands producing music of this caliber. This was a great cd not only because most of the music was good but also because much of the music was wrote to be somewhat humorus.  The front cover of the cd is interesting as well.  The best song on this cd dosent stand out as much as it does on a couple of the other cds but my personal favorite is ""coffee and cigarettes"".  The other songs worth noting are ""island of shame"", ""stokin'the neighbors"", ""give it back"", ""whipping boy"", ""bye for now"", and more controvertially ""lazy"".  People who cut lagwagon more slack may also like know it all, rust, and brown eyed girl if they really like some of the other versions of the later song.  over all most of the songs are good to acceptable making this a good buy for people who enjoy ""alternative punk"" Lagwagons gotta be one of the most underrated bands of the 90's. First off, Lagwagons not pop punk in their early days.  It's a blend of the softer side of early 80's hardcore punk (Circle Jerks, Descendents, metal (Anthrax, Iron Maiden) and a bit of pop punk (Jawbreaker, Nofx.)  It's got it's own thing going.  The main attraction here is Joey Cape. He's definitely one of the most underappreciated songwriters out there, and a unique vocalist in the vein of Joey Ramone.  Duh has better lyrics than most bands ever do.  Same thing with Trashed.  His lyrics are really insightful.  He has a lot of good things to say and he writes about the kinds of issues that songwriting should be about.  He's definitely not wasting his voice.  I'd say it's a must have for anyone who's a fan of intelligent songwriting, early 80's hardcore, thrash and speed metal, and the more melodic side of punk. although Lagwagon shares alot of similarities with other pop punk bands (weirdly synthed backup harmonies, crappy cover songs, big shorts, etc.), they dish out some clever and catchy upbeat songs that have some charm. they take their melodic cue from seminal bands like The Descendents and come across sounding more like contemporaries like Bracket rather than NOFX. they certainly seem more inclined to the pop spectrum of songwriting rather than the punk. but the covers of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" and the hidden track (which seems to be some kind of misguided tribute to LL Cool J) are just unforgiveable. Alright Double Plaidinum was amazing and all, but I think this is Lagwagon's best. Although this might be the album where the impersonate NOFX the most, it's also the best. Songs like &quot;Rust&quot;,  &quot;Dis'chords&quot;, and &quot;No One&quot; really show the lyrical  genius that would be shown next in Double Plaidinum. Buy this CD! This CD here is one of the best CD's I have ever heard, come from a punk rawk band.  It is by far the best talent ridden CD there is. I remember this song was on Ncaa football 06 on ps2 and I listend to it and purchased there cd with the song trash but its not only that one song anymore its all 14 of there songs on there album TRASHED if you like lagwagon or 1990's punk music this is for you this album is probably the greatest .....of lagwagon.....joey cape sings kinda cool and a bunch of funny stuff you know?....I liked a lot lazy....and fat mike's apperance in this album.....that's right this is another great fat wreck's good thing....so buy it now pendejo! I am a fan of Lagwagon but this is the only release by the band that i cant get into no matter how hard i try the only tracks i really like are know it all, coffee and cigarettes, bye for now, mamma said knock you out and stokin the neighbours. Alot of Lagwagon fans rank this as there best release but i would put leftovers, duh and blaze up there. I tried to get into this album but even after owning it for about 4 years i still dont like it. Though this is many peoples favourite Lagwagon record it's never grown on me in the four years i have owned it. The only tracks i really like are know it all, stokin the neighbours, coffee and cigarettes and bye for now the rest just seems to get boring and old really fast, most punk fans would probably love this cd having said that a few wont like it and would go for the more melodic Lagwagon material. Trashed has some really bad songs on it such as goin south and lazy where as the previous release Duh just ran through smoothly and had mainly great tracks throughout. I can see why Trashed appeals to alot of lagwagon fans though i just could'nt get into it. This CD and Hoss are the best lagwagon CD's out there. The guitar riffs are great, the lyrics are what punk lyrics should be about, no song says it better than coffee and cigarettes. Although i like neither of them, this is great CD. Trashed is a great punk album, if ur a like real punk get these guys. they make good tunes to get u fired up.I rate the songs out of 5:Island of shame-3Lazy-3know it all-4.5stokin'the neighbors-4give it back-4rust-4goin' south-3dis'cords-3.5coffee and cigarettes-4.5brown eyed girl-4 ( a good cover)whipping boy-4no one-4bye for now-3.5this is a lagwagon must have! if u don't have it you betta have DP! I'm 29 years old. I 1st heard this album while i was a freshman in '94. I had the cassette tape and i played this album at least 3 or 4 times all the way through in a day. This is probably my favorite album from them, then Hoss. This cd is definately a landmark in punk history. They sound a little bit like Nofx with the double guitars, but they also have their own, unique sound that we've all come to love. Just to let you know how good it is. At the time i was only listening to the real punk like the stuff in the late 70's and early and mid 80's like the Subhumans, Misfits,DK,Black Flag,crass, rudimentary peni,d.i and etc.. Trashed was the only exception besides nofx white trash two heebs and a bean and punk in drublic and ribbed. If you haven't heard this album buy it. It isn't an investment, it's a necessity. Lagwagon rocks. You'll understand what i mean when you pop in this cd.  Man. This cd is amazing.

286,585,B0000007PU,"i used to own this album, but i sold it.  For a strung out album and a fat band.  It's actually not that good.  It's lacks a lot of power that they have  gained in the 3 realeases after this one.  If you are a first time strung out buyer....buy twisted by design!!!!  it is wonderful. With the glut of awful skatecore bands plaguing the earth, it would be easy to pass off Strung Out as just another baggy-pants teenage fad.  Well, this was their first effort for Fat Records, and their best.  Back when  they still had a slightly metal tinge to their sound that made them stand  out.  Nowadays, they're just another melodicore band in an overcrowded  field of them, which is too bad.  But many formerly decent bands have  followed this path (Lagwagon) so it really isn't surprising.  So if  skatecore is your thing, any Strung Out album will do, but if you want to  hear pre-&quot;just another Fat band&quot; Strung Out then pick this one  up. This CD rules.  It is one of my favorite punk cds of all time.  I saw them at the warped tour and they are just as good on the CD.  Get this CD.  It rules. This CD wasn't great, i'll be honest.  All i seem to hear from punk fans these days is how bands like NOFX, Lagwagon, Strung Out etc... started out good, but have just got worse and worse.  In my opinion, these people could  not be more wrong.  How can anyone not like the new Lagwagon and NOFX cd's  is beyond me.  If people would just stop and listen to the melodies in such  CD's then they would realise that change is not a bad thing.  This CD was  far too metal and not enough melody.

288,587,B0000007Q3,"No Use for A Name is the best band out right now...any cd they come out with is great including this one..&gt;FATAL FLU and SOULMATE are 2 of the best songs ever written...NUFAN FOR LIFE Leche Con Carne (meaning milk with meat) is a good CD, but sometimes it  gets a little slow. The first few tracks are alright, like Justified and  Couch Boy and Redemption Song, but then i just skip a few of the tracks and  listen to Exit. if i am bored one day, i will listen to the whole CD, but i  just dont think its the greatest. I might be wrong, just this is my  thoughts. I go for the really fast, energetic type of punk, you might be  that hardcore Emo fan that disagrees with me. fine. i dont care. this was my introduction to no use for a name and was my highschool soundtrack.  while my peers were jammin to all the small things, i was dealing out justified black eyes :) this cd also taught me how to play guitar and tony sly's voice / melodies are the bombdangleedoo. leche con aburrimiento is gay and shouldnt tell people to grow up and also 70s punk was punk at its worst NUFAN at thier best.... They have come along way since &quot;Incognito,&quot; and sound a ton better. This is a great album... It is a faster album and very melodic.... Great stuff.... I saw these guys  live with Mad Caddies and Consumed on the Fat Tour 00' and they are even  better live.... Also pick up &quot;More Betterness,&quot; another great  album.... what an awful band!!!!! stupid lyrics, same rhytms, all those bands sound the same, why don't you try with lyrics more real...grown up, kids!!! the real punk is into the 70's...the roots. This album is one of their best...this or More Betterness. Either way, it's still a great album. Justified, Couch Boy, 51 Days, and Redemption Song (Bob Marley cover) are good songs. The whold album is good lyrically. I first heard this band on a fat comp and thought they were pretty cool. And then I heard &quot;Straight From The Jacket&quot; and that convinced me to but it. But it wasn't that great of a CD. If your a Hard-core punk fan  though pick it up. If not buy something mellow with its share of punk like  Millencolin. I've been out of the punk rock game for some time now, so it's weird that when hearing this record it sounded so familiar...  I can't tell you about the zillions of bands that sprung up in the '90s and are still squeezing out a decent living, and I think it's great that 13 year old kids are finding their way into rock music, and finding a place to release all that crazy energy adolescence and puberty gives you.  It's just a bummer that so many of these albums and bands sound indistinguishable from one another, at least to my ears.  It's as though they've all agreed to subscribe to the Punk Rock Formula:  fast songs, high energy, lots of major chords changing every 2 or 4 bars, distorted chunky guitars, Us vs Them (or 'nobody understands me') lyrics, occasionally strong melodies, and so on.  It's hard to distinguish yourself in such a restricted environment, and ""Leche Con Carne"" doesn't.  It's got all the requisite elements in place, but to me sounds like BAD RELIGION with slightly poorer musicianship, songwriting shops and lead vocals.  I'd point you to BR's ""All Ages"" for a much better punk rock eduction! For those who don't know, NUFAN's pre-Fat Records stuff (on NRA) was very different from the likes of this record.  Where they were formerly very thrashy/harsh, here they are harmonic and more melodic.  This was the one  that sent them into the indie-punk big-time, and rightfully so.  Soaring,  hard yet melodic tunes that maintain a unique quality amongst a field of  generic bands.  Their post-Leche efforts have been alright, but this one  stands out as their finest moment.  If you haven't heard them, start here  first. This is an awesome melodic hardocor punk album. I dig the music, and the inteesting vocals. Good album by a good band , before this album  NUFAN had a some albums that were just hot or miss nothing consistently good and appealing but it semms that on this one they finally nailed down what kind of style they wanted to accomplish. This and Making friends are probably the best two albums of their career so far. So i go and buy this tape...What a joke while the lyrics are good.

289,589,B0000007QG,"THIS CD (...)!!!! I first bought Double PLadium then i took it back because the cd was skipping. The store didn't have an extra copy of Double PLadium so i bought Hoss instead. That was the biggest mistake i have ever made. Everysong sounds the same. I bought this cd 2 months ago and tried really hard to like this cd, but i couldn't.  If you must get a Lagwagon CD then go out and buy Double Pladium. Double PLadium is 10 times better. I think this is one of their best cd's! Actually I like them all but this one is great!  If you don't yet have it go and get it . Any of them.You won't be disappointed! Hoss is by far the greatest punk album ever.  I have played this cd for many people in my life and have never met anyone that disliked this music.  Not even my dad.  The Melodic Punk music that is Lagwagon emulates from Joey's amazing voice and creative yet poignant lyrics and continues through the fantastic guitars and bass of Chris, Leon and Jessie.  The music flows from beginning to end, from song to song, and there is not one song that you will ever want to turn off before it is completed.  If you like punk music and don't already know of Lagwagon or haven't yet heard this album, I promise you that purchasing this will change your life.  I give this cd 10 stars and highly recommend it for any music fan! This has been in my top 5 favorite albums since it came out!  A Phenomenal  album.. It's not just your typical pop/california punk, although it  definitely sits in that vein.  Very unique songwriting and guitar stylings  will especially appeal to musicians who are tired of hearing the same old  melodies.  You MUST buy this album NOW! This is a quality album and I reckon everyone should have a copy. Best songs are blatantly RAZOR BURN, VIOLINS and BLACK EYES. I only gave it four stars because DOUBLE PLAIDINUM is shed loads better. Get that  First! don't get me wrong, this is a great punk album.  I just like the newer cds much better.  The production of this one isn't quite as good as let's talk about feelings or Double Plaidinum.  Still, the songs are really great.Check out the tracks &quot;Bomb's Away&quot; and &quot;Sick&quot;.  Two Lagwagon Classics!!!! I'm not a huge Lagwagon fan but I do enjoy some of their stuff.  One song inspired me to buy this album: ""Violins"".  Overall it was a good purchase and I'm happy with the entire album. I'm a punk fan. I have been for many years. Contrary to what john chilstrom says this cd is punk and green day and offspring are not true punk. Now the cd, this is the only lagwagon cd i own but it is great. I first heard the song &quot;Bombs Away&quot; and it became my favorite song. I would recommend this cd to all lovers of punk cds Hoss is a truely great cd because I was able to listen through the entire cd and not hate any of the songs so much as to not want to listen to them.  giving the cd artwork the theme of bonanza was a good idea too because it made for some interesting and humorus artwork and makes the cd feel more american.  youve got to at least feel a little guilty about not liking american western culture as a form of entertainment if you live in this country.  You can tell all these songs were meant to be on this cd because they all have the same feel to them.  The best songs on the cd are violins and sick in my opinion.  razor burn, rifle, and bombs away are all real strong too.  out of all the songs violins and move the car seem to be the most distinct.  Even if you dont think hoss is the best lagwagon cd you might as well get it anyway cause itll make your cd collection look more interesting. Well everyone gave this great reviews honestly I don't see whats so special about it.  No punk, this is not punk at all.  I like the beats, but the songs don't have that certain punkishness to them.Maybe it's just cuz I've been spoiled by Greenday, and Offspring, stuff like that, which is true punk.  Man, I could of sworn I heard this on the easy listening station, haha. This album is AMAZING. Lagwagon is what punk *IS*. I own all of the lagwagon CD's. This is the best. This is the point Joey's lyrics started improving and getting more meaning full. I love the older albums, but how many songs can you listen to about drinking beer? Everyone needs to check out Joey's other band Bad Astronaunt. whats with everybody sayin this is the greatist album ever... its not that great. the drumming is kick ass but... not much better than other lag albums.. i think trashed is the best so far... (well thats the only other one i have and im in love with it.) this cd is too happy... over use of melodys and crap. i mean.. sure it works a lot of the time but this cd isnt really that punk apart from the drum beats. trashed is punk. oh and you guy that said you listen to offspring and greenday and you say ur punk... man... get out more. listen to nofx, bad religion, casualties, OLD afi, circle jerks, OLD nufan, and then figure out which is more punk. This was my second lagwagon album after Trashed. (which I thought was excellent)At first I thought this cd was good, but not great and way different than Trashed and Duh. (I had downloaded a few songs off Duh before)After months of listening to Hoss every now and then, it really did get boring. I really always listened to the same songs every time. (Name Dropping,Razor Burn,Black eyes, the ending of violins and sleep.)It really is more melodic/poppier than lagwagons first two releases. I still like melodic punk but the melodic punk on this wasn't even that great. The music on DP,Feelings and leftovers that i had heard before, were more impresive than the majority of songs on Hoss. In my opinion the stuff on Trashed, Duh and DP is the best. I've been a Lagwagon fan since I was in 6th grade.  'Bombs Away' was the first track I've ever heard from them and was hooked from that day forward.  I just lost my previous CD so I had to stock up. :) Lagwagon's &quot;Hoss&quot; was probably the easiest album to like. All  the songs are catchy and melodic. The sound of the music is a little bit of  pop, a little bit of hardcore, and a whole lot of punk. The best songs on  &quot;Hoss&quot; are &quot;Violins&quot; and &quot;Name Dropping&quot;, and  then of course there is &quot;Bro Independent&quot;, my new favorite song.  Whether you like pop-punk or hardcore, you should still by this album. Lagwagon can do no wrong!...well, so maybe the cover of &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; added as an extra track on Trashed wasn't so hot, but still... The band's third full-length is another great cd, and is a breath of fresh air thanks to all the critics who said they had that &quot;NOFX sound&quot; on their first two outtings.  Some time off has led to a different sound than their past two albums.  The real stand-outs here are &quot;Violins&quot;, &quot;Move the Car&quot;, &quot;Sleep&quot;, &quot;Sick&quot;, &quot;Razor Burn&quot;...I might as well name all the tracks, huh?  Definitely worth your hard earned money. Lagwagon is one of the best punk bands out there, too bad you can't hear the four best songs: Sick, Rifle, Weak, and Violins Althought this album doesn't have a song to top the two most gr**ving  beautiful distopic tunes on fear and loathing in Isla Vista, CA that we heard on 92's &quot;DUH&quot; (&quot;Angry Days&quot;) and 94's  &quot;Trashed&quot; (&quot;Know It All&quot; -- take that KCSB!), it is no  doubt the Wagon's strongest overall offering to date.Even that mythical  beast -- the so-called &quot;punk purist&quot; -- has gotta get out and  shake his butt to this one! This is my favorite Lagwagon album next to Trashed, it has a good punk fell to it.. nice guitar chours through out the album, one of my favorite songs from Lagwagon happens to be in this album called Hoss its ""Razor Burn"" which is a great tone for a punk rock fan great melidies in it and caught my attention when I listend to this album. It has 14 songs in it and they never seem to let me down and you will hopefully enjoy it as much as I did listening to it... I do recommend this to any true Lagwagon fan but besides this the 1994 Trashed album is one of Lagwagon's all time best punk rock albums they have and will ever make... but following the next year in 1995 when Hoss came out and was named my second best album by these guys, so I do recommend this album greatly!!! I loved this CD back when I could stand punk.  If you're into that stuff, it's fairly good -- no stupid lyrics and a few interesting melodies.  Not my thing now, but decent. I never really liked trashed so when this came out i was hoping Lagwagon wouldnt take the direction of trashed, they just went in a complete u turn and released one of the great punk albums around today all the songs are good on this album, lagwagon are still releaseing quality music today which is why they are one of the greatest punk bands to be around today in my opinion. There is a lack of Lagwagon guitar sols on this but the music rocks so who cares really.. Even if you are a crotchety old punk rock curmudgeon, you still hafta like this album.  Lagwagon had been around awhile prior to this one and had some good releases, but this was when that &quot;Epi-Fat&quot; sound was really  breaking out and thus all the more compelling.  Very catchy tunes with  surprisingly witty, insightful lyrics in a power-pop-punk package make it  an irresistable recording.  It's a shame that they would go on to change  their sound and head toward a slicker, dumber Blink182 type sound.  Get  this one and remember pop-punk before the avalanche. From start to finish, I don't think you'll find a better Lagwagon album. This is probably one of the best punk albums to come out of the 90's...tons of melodies, super fast rhythms, wide range of songs.If you're reading this review you're probably just getting into Lagwagon, in that case...BUY THIS ALBUM. LET ME SAY I HAD A FRIEND WHO LOVED THIS BAND AND I WAS A LITTLE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT PUNK BUT I BOUGHT THIS CD AND TWO OTHERE BY THIS BAND AND THEY ARE LIKE THE BEST.  PERFECT INSTRUMENTS AND JOES VOICE IS ORIGINAL AND  DOPE.  I JUST HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THEM IN CONCERT ONE DAY CAUSE THEY  ROCK.  BUY THIS CD AND ALL THE OTHER LAGWAGON CDS I GAURUNDAMNTEE YOU WONT  BE SORRY JABRONIS Ok, now this is the complete truth... this CD (even though, it's my second most favorite CD, next to Unwritten Law's self titled), is not Lagwagon's best! I love this CD like crazy, but and it is an awesome CD, but if you've never heard Lagwagon before buy &quot;Let's Talk About Feelings&quot; first. That one will get you hooked, then come back and buy this one. &quot;Let's Talk About Feelings&quot; will get you hooked, &quot;Hoss&quot; will keep you hooked.Now, in everything made by Lagwagon, and you will notice this from the start, isn't like anything from any other band.  The vocals are unmatched anywhere... just listen to his voice... have you ever heard a voice like that?! If you ever dreamed of the best of the best coming together and making one band, his voice would definitely be in there, or at least right next to the guy from Strung Out!  The lyrics, just superb... easy to sing to, and never annoying... you could play the songs over and over and still want to keep playing them over and over.  The drums, are not as mature as later albums, but still great in their prime (They're awesome here and definitely get better through time).  The drums are never repetitive in this album or any of their others... that's what makes them so much more easier to get hooked on! The guitars... oh... just... well, you gotta hear em for yourself... only thing is, the best show of their mastery of guitars is in the song 'Sick'... i guess if you really want to hear it before you buy, try looking for a sample elsewhere, or just listen to the samples here and trust in the ratings of this CD... but believe me and everyone else in these reviews.If you like these samples, you'll love the rest of the songs... besides, you'll never know unless you buy it, and with Lagwagon you can't go wrong! Folks, if you love good rock music and punk rock... maybe play in a punk band yourself and are sick of the same boring three chords again and again ? Then go and get THIS great album... I think there's no better punk rock release exept one... Lagwagon has the Greatest sounding Punk music.Hoss is a Great Album.Rifle is a great song to Skate to.Many people put down Lagwagn but they are the Greatest Punk Band in the World. This is by far one of the best cd's i have ever heard along with big daddy multitude by mustard plug, it has all the energy of punk and you never get bored of it, it takes a few listens to get really into it though. I hope the punk mainstream soon stops and also hope people would'nt compare lagwagon to nofx for one it gives them a stupid amount of publicity due to nofx been so popular and for another they both sound different to each other, this album has some really good guitar on it aswell only Trashed is better for that.","Alternative Rock,Punk Revival,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore & Punk,Punk-Pop",cd first bought double pladium took back cd skipping store didnt extra copy double pladium bought hoss instead biggest mistake ever made everysong sounds bought cd months ago tried really hard like cd couldnt must get lagwagon cd go buy double pladium double pladium times better think one best cds actually like one great dont yet go get wont disappointed hoss far greatest punk ever played cd many people life never met anyone disliked even dad melodic punk lagwagon emulates joeys amazing voice creative yet poignant lyrics continues fantastic guitars bass chris leon jessie flows beginning end one cd bought double took back cd skipping store extra copy double bought instead biggest mistake mistake sounds bought cd months tried really hard cd cd buy double double times better think best cds actually great wont disappointed far greatest punk played cd people life met disliked dad melodic melodic punk punk lagwagon emulates joeys amazing voice creative poignant lyrics continues fantastic guitars bass flows beginning end

293,597,B0000007RH,"I first heard Screw 32 on a soundtrack to a snowboarding video, and it definetly stuck out as one of the best songs on it. The song was &quot;Painless&quot; and it rips. But &quot;Painless&quot; isn't the only  song that kicks, all of them do! I have yet to be get tired of this cd, it  RULES! Fat really is an amazing record label despite what alot of the music snobs frequantly say, fat has firstly given us every Lagwagon album available, the short but great appearance of the Duncan from snuff side project guns n' wankers, a new soon to be released descendents album, face to face's classic first full length, the mad caddies (of course), some masterpieces from the swingin' utters and of course screw 32's unique style of punk music that really is tough to beat (especially the track painless) however i would rather have seen screw 32's lifespan to have been a little bit longer but this happens good bands sometimes split and screw 32 are one of many out there so just re-live their great punk style with whatever Screw 32 you can find out there. This is one of those records/bands that were really underrated. They played a different style of melodic punk/hardcore that no band today still really plays. I belive they had members of UNIT PRIDE (?). Anyhow, don't let the FAT lable release fool you, this is a solid release from a band that should have had much more attention paid to them. The record has a feel to it, and the artwork on the record all goes along very well, sort of like alot of the DC bands did. if you're looking for sugary sweet pop punk, look elese where. if you're looking for faster HC, look elsewhere also. It is a solid record. period. As was their 1st full length. The first Screw 32 song i heard was &quot;Black Marker&quot; and the first like 30 seconds of the song i already knew i needed this cd. Andrew Champion is an awsome song writer and Doug Sangalang is great on guitar. If you dont have this cd your missing out, and if you like Screw 32 try to get your hands on Hopelifter, Highwire Days, and End Of The World. They are Andrew Chamion's other bands he is or have been in. Ok obviously i dont need to say much, this band rocks all the time, every one of their cd's is great and you should go buy them all.","Alternative Rock,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore,Hardcore & Punk",first heard screw soundtrack snowboarding video definetly stuck one best quot painless quot rips quot painless quot isnt kicks yet get tired cd rules fat really amazing record label despite alot snobs frequantly say fat firstly given us every lagwagon available short great appearance duncan snuff side project guns n wankers new soon released descendents face faces classic first full length mad caddies course masterpieces swingin utters course screw unique style punk really tough beat especially painless however would rather seen screw lifespan little bit longer happens good bands sometimes split screw one many live great punk style whatever screw fin heard screw soundtrack snowboarding video stuck best quot painless quot rips painless quot kicks tired cd rules fat really amazing record record label label alot snobs say fat firstly lagwagon available short great appearance snuff side side project project guns guns n wankers wankers new soon released descendents face faces classic full full length length mad mad caddies caddies course masterpieces swingin utters utters course screw unique style punk really tough beat especially painless seen screw lifespan little bit little bit longer bit longer happens good bands split screw live great punk punk style style screw fin
294,599,B0000007RT,"this cd is really amazing, all the songs are cool,, and catchy. I bought  this cd 2 month ago and i still hear it all day long. Songs like growing  down , invincible, secret, are songs that  you wiill never get tired of,  cause they have a really cool and original rythm,this is what makes nufan  songs so cool, their originality. DONT HESITATE IN BUYING THIS CD , CAUSE I  PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE IT. I really enjoyed this CD, though the last few songs are a bit forgettable.  The first four tracks are my favorite, with &quot;Invincible&quot; being one of my Top 100 songs of all time.  I also don't fully agree with another reviewers opinions of the &quot;Fields of Athenry&quot; cover.  I personally love it, and I would put it up with the Dropkick Murphys latest.  Yes, I will allow that a punk version of this song will never sound as good as an Irish tenor version.  Still, as wrong as it may be, it was this version of the song that opened up the world of paddy punk to me, including such great bands as the Pogues and the Mahones!  My only complaint about this CD are the tracks around the end of the album.  I have listened to this CD on a regular basis for several years now, but I don't think I could tell you anything about those three or four tracks.  They just aren't that memorable. this is the best no use for a name song PERIOD!  Don't even buy the other albums becasue this is the best one, and the others just lower the standard that No Use established on this record! Easily their best album to date.. They've gotten even better at guitar and  vocal harmonies, and their lyric writing has improved even further!  A must  buy for any punk fan! Having thought Lagwagon to be the best band in the cosmos i checked out covernotes of a L/W CD and found NUFAN mentioned.i then bought this CD and quite frankly it is the very best Punk cd that i own (and i own a few!).Right fom the opening track until the magnificent closing song&quot;Fields of Athenry&quot; it moves at pace but with purpose and with excellent musicianship. There are few bands who could live with this quality, and my advice is buy it NOW--if not sooner (and possibly Leche Con Carne also. This is a pretty average album from a great band. The CD starts off with two great songs in a row, ""Invincible"" being my all-time favorite No Use song ever made. The rest kind of go down-hill. I like ""Secret"", also, but the rest of the album feels like it was made just to put out an album. It all blends together and sounds like one big, three-chord song. The lyrics are kind of weak and the songs are either too short with too little, or too long and make you get tired of them and change them like old, dirty undies. Three stars for an okay album. Good to get if you're big on No Use, otherwise skip it. And if you're thinking of just getting into them, pick up ""Leche Con Carne"" or ""Don't Miss the Train"". This cd is so great. I've had it for probably 5 months or more and still love it. All I wanna say is buy this cd before you buy any of their others. If you already have this cd, buy &quot;Leche Con Carne&quot;. This cd is a  rarity in that all the songs are great and don't get old. I have 258 cds  and this one is in the top 5% as far as good albums go. After you have this  cd, buy all the Lagwagon cds starting with &quot;Trashed&quot; because they  compare well with NUFAN and are probably a little better aside from the  fact that this cd ROCKS! This is a pretty good CD. The first 6 songs are excellent, ""Invincible"" being my favorite No Use song ever written, produced, and published. After that it kind of gets old. ""On the Outside"" is another great track. There is a trend in every single No Use album...Can you guess? They say ""F*ck"" once in every CD, they cover one song on every CD, and they have a girl sing on every CD. Well, maybe they don't cover a song on EVERY CD, but almost. ""Leche Con Carne"" is their best CD by far, but this one still gets a high score. It's not a bad CD. I would have given this album more stars if it had NOT included the terrible rendition of Fields of Athenry. This song is not a Scottish folk song as some people seem to think but it is an Irish rebel song sung at Celtic football(soccer) matches and NUFAN have totally wrecked this amazing song as you need to have a fantastic atmosphere to get the true meaning of this song.However the rest of the album is quite good. ""Best Regards"" is amazing. This album is very good, but doesn't pull it all together as well as Leche Con Carne.  It sounds about the same but doesn't have as many outstanding songs. This is a good album it has the same feel as Leche con carne but the songs are just a little less memorbale but its still pretty good. I would get that album first. Invincible and the answer is still no are awesome to start off the album.","Alternative Rock,Punk Revival,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore & Punk",cd really amazing cool catchy bought cd month ago still hear day long like growing invincible secret wiill never get tired cause really cool original rythm makes nufan cool originality dont hesitate buying cd cause promise love really enjoyed cd though last bit forgettable first four favorite quot invincible quot one top time also dont fully agree another reviewers opinions quot fields athenry quot cover personally love would put dropkick murphys latest yes allow punk version never sound good irish tenor version still wrong may version opened world paddy punk including great bands pogues mahones comp cd really amazing cool catchy bought cd month hear day long growing invincible secret tired really cool original rythm cool originality hesitate buying cd promise love really enjoyed cd bit forgettable favorite quot invincible quot time fully agree reviewers opinions fields athenry quot cover personally love dropkick dropkick murphys murphys latest allow punk version sound good irish tenor version wrong version opened world paddy paddy punk punk including great bands pogues mahones comp
295,600,B0000007RW,"This is a must have punk album. Not pop-punk, and not windspitting punk (to use Swingin Utters' term), It's a great lot of well thought out punk songs that show a talent for song writing, as well as lyrics writing.  Lagwagon continues to please its fans with awesome music, (albeit this album is getting to be an older album now, released 1997).  If you like stuff from fat wreck chords then you're gonna like this album.  It won't please fans of the harder punk style, but it there is no denying its greatness. There are a lot more song on this download than the original album. The songs are in different order. It was not what I expected. Kind of disappointed. It's definitely different, but shows a musical development.  It's nice to  find a band that is willing to evolve instead of just keep making the same  albums over and over.  If you like Lagwagon (or even if you don't) and  you're open minded about your music, pick this one up. I bought this Lagwagon album when it came out.  I was already interested in Lagwagon before I bought it.  Let me way that it is not the best.  You would have to look at Hoss, Duh, or Trashed depending on your style.Hoss is more poppy-melodic catchy songs.Duh is heavier-melodicand Trashed is fast, metal-melodic punkThis cd is better than most [stuff] coming out nowso go buy a good punk cd WELL LAGWAGON ROX AND THIS CD ROX SO U SHOULD TOTALLY BUY IT! BY IT NOW OR DIE, its sew cooooooool. I own it, its almost dead, because i have played it too much. I play it in the morning, on my discman on scool, when i eat, EVERYVERE. Like an old friend, this CD never let's me down.  All solid tracks,  I can put this in and never once skip a tune.  Exellent lyrics backed up by powerful harmonic chords, this was the first Lagwagon I heard, and it still keeps me hooked.  Of all their other albums, this remains my favorite to listen to.  If you're tired of the monotonous bubblgum alternative ripoff bands, and want some good 'ol SB punk, look no farther. In comparison to other lagwagon cds this one is my least favorite.  ""today"" is definatly the best song on the cd followed by ""alien 8"", ""One thing to live"", and barely cutting it ""Twenty seven""  making frineds and unfurnished are worth listening to once but the rest just dont cut it.  If you really like lagwagon this should probably be the cd you get to complete your collection after getting the rest. A friend of mine told me about Lagwagon and so i went out and bought this cd. at first i didn't really like it cause it wasn't as hard as some other punk bands (Pennywise, nofx) i'd been listening to but it really grew on me and now it's one of my favorite cds. It's soft fast punk with great lyrics, i guess the style is sort of lie Nofx but softer. the other cds by them i own are duh and let's talk about leftovers but this one is probly the best. it's definately worth buying if you're a punk fan. Lagwagon really impressed me to say the least, I totally give these guys props for making excellent punk on &quot;Double Plaidinum&quot;. They are experienced, and obviously talented musicians. Which is why they sound so  tight together. The songwriting is quite good as well, and there are plenty  of re-listenable songs too. However, I do think it was a BIT overhyped by  the reviewers at this web-site, there are a few real yawners on this CD. I  also do not think it is &quot;The best punk album ever,&quot; like many  people say. Don't get me wrong though, Lagwagon is definately a great band.  Also, if you like these guys, you should definately check out similar punk  group &quot;Craig's Brother,&quot; I like them even more than Lagwagon. You  should buy this CD if you are a fan of well-put-together punk rock. One of my favorite albums for this awesome band. Do yourself a favor and buy it. You will not be disappointed. THIS IS GOOD BUT BY LESS THAN JAKE 'PEZ COLLECTION' FIRST. After having this album for over two years, I still listen to it  regularly.  It is by far Lagwagon's best album to date, both technically  and musically.  If you are deciding which album of theirs to get, I suggest  you get this one first. I like Lagwagon's &quot;Double Pladinum&quot; alot, but it seems that they are incorporating more and more alternative pop-punk into every album.  Even if that serves true, i'll still like it, the reason I gave the album 4 stars instead of 5 is because HOSS is simply a far better album than this, and I couldn't help but make that comparison.  &quot;Alien 8&quot;, &quot;Making Friends&quot;, and &quot;Unfurnished&quot; are the first three songs, and each are so different from each other; &quot;Alien 8&quot; goes from slow and mellow to fast and raw, &quot;Making Friends&quot; has a trippy mid tempo sound, and &quot;Unfurnished&quot;, which is the best song on the CD, is the most punk song on the album. Nontheless all the songs are great, especially &quot;Bad Scene&quot; and &quot;To All My Friends&quot;. Double Plaidinum is my favorite Lagwagon album, easily.  The darker feel for this release is definitely my kind of music.  Joey Cape is one of the best punk vocalists around and the band proves once-and-for-all with this album, they are no NOFX knock-off.  The highlights here are difficult to pick out because every song is great, but my personal favorites were &quot;Confession&quot;, &quot;Bad Scene&quot; and &quot;Failure&quot;.  Pop-punk at its finest, Lagwagon is one of the most talented punk bands on the scene today. This album is the most awsome sound-track.. When you listen to this music it gives you a feeling that words can't describe. This album is top quality because it reminds you how the real world and life is. You have to get this  C.D. you dont know what you are missing out on. If you are a big fan and  want to chat (seegarz@web.net) This release is not Lagwagons best but is still alright to listen to every now and then, when i hear double plaidinum i cant help feeling that the band just tried to put to much into one song every now and again which made it sound over the top in alot of ways though there are a few stand out tracks such as Today, twenty seven and making friends. This album was also released when the band was re-grouping in a way with a new drummer and a new guitarist and Joey said himself it was the hardest Lagwagon record they have released which shows at times, having said that blaze was a tough release and thats an amazing punk cd, double plaidinum shows the more experimental side of Lagwagon and the inclusion of this is good at times so i'd buy this one after a few other lagwagon albums such as blaze, duh, lets talk about leftovers and lets talk about feelings. Lagwagon, one of the greats. This was my first Lagwagon album, when I initially got into them, several years ago. I will admit that this one might take some getting used to, however, give it the time it deserves and you will see what an outstanding punk album this is. Joey Cape and the crew have been putting out great stuff for years and &quot;Double Plaidinum&quot; was far from a let down. With the current state of what is considered &quot;punk&quot; these days it would be an excellent idea for all of those 14 year old MTV-ers to put down their Simple Plan and use their allowance for something worthwhile. Lagwagon would be a great place for them to start. But then again, I doubt any of them will stumble upon this review in their search for the newest tripe released by The All American Rejects.84/100 If You've never heard of Lagwagon, you should have. They are simply one of the best punk bands around today. Thier guitar style is very much like NOFX yet they have thier own sound. The best song on the album is probably Choke as it combines speed chnges amazing guitar riffs and harmonies. Double Pladinum was the first Lagga album I bought and is probably the best (along with Lets Talk About Left Overs) Most of the album is soft punk with a lot of tune and harmonies, unlike trashed, which is mainly  metal and fast punk. If you a young punk fan looking for some hot melodies, then you must buy this album. I THINK IT IS BEST LAGWAGON'S CD, I BOUGHT IT AN YEAR AGO AND I STILL LISTEN TO IT.

296,605,B0000007TX,"You may think of Steve Roach as this relaxing and ambient artist whose sonic atmospheres float lovingly from one open space to another.  For a lot of Steve Roach music, that prior description fits his compositional style very well.  And for those who love the ambient Steve Roach this Album may not be for you.  For those of you, who want to know another side of Steve Roach, read on!  Steve Roach had to get his start somewhere, and Traveler was in the beginning.  Influenced by not only the bands of the time and the technology available, Traveler gives you a look at how Steve Roach and the Berlin School of Electronic Music melded as one.  This is not floating from one space to another.  No, No my friend!  This is passages of sequences, minor chords, and sonic flights that change and dart from one thought to another.  This is Steve Roach #2.  The second album!  If you like the Berlin School, then check out this album.  Enjoy!!! While Traveler is Steve Roach's second album, it shows tremendous promise and is a harbinger of things to come. He recorded it in the analog domain, but his innovative recording techniques give it a digital sound. Much of the inspiration for this set comes from concert recordings. And, while Roach has always put deep feelings and spirituality into his music, this comes from the start of his quest for knowledge and enlightenment. It always comes back to the unknown and the lust to uncover the answers. This landmark effort speaks to Roach's influences: Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream, and his own innovative tribal ambience.","Alternative Rock,Indie & Lo-Fi,American Alternative,New Age,Indie Rock",may think steve roach relaxing ambient artist whose sonic atmospheres float lovingly one open space another lot steve roach prior description fits compositional style well love ambient steve roach may want know another side steve roach read steve roach get start somewhere traveler beginning influenced bands time technology available traveler gives look steve roach berlin school electronic melded one floating one space another friend passages sequences minor chords sonic flights change dart one thought another steve roach second like berlin school check enjoy traveler steve roachs second shows tremendous promise harbinger things think steve roach roach relaxing ambient artist sonic atmospheres float lovingly open space lot steve roach roach prior description fits compositional style love ambient steve roach roach want know side steve roach roach read steve roach roach start traveler beginning influenced bands time technology available traveler look steve roach roach berlin berlin school school electronic melded floating space friend passages sequences minor minor chords chords sonic flights change dart thought steve roach roach second berlin berlin school school check enjoy traveler steve roachs roachs second shows tremendous promise harbinger things

Steve Roach is one of those prolific artists who can spin and weave almost endlessly, churning out new musical ideas, allowing us to look down upon nature/biogeographic zones -- namely the desert -- and atmosphere/space.&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;Where some of his albums admittedly re-hash older motifs or contain previously released material -- a habit I wish he would avoid -- ""Artifacts"" doesn't just quietly assume its place on the terrace of native ambience.  It creates it.&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;Within the timeframe of 77 minutes and 12 seconds, Roach will transport you from his Timeroom in Tucson directly into his backyard.  You can only begin to imagine the wilderness of the desert, the frogs near a pond, the dim glow of the zodiacal light burning black into blue on the horizon.  But Roach isn't keen on giving you a tour of his desertscapes but, rather, an appreciation of the sands, the sounds, the breezes, the temperature, the humidity, the height of the skies expanding above you and forever to each side, and finally: time-lapse expansion.&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;""Artifacts"" is in itself inspired by more than desert.  William Lesch's photography has a major role in Roach's compositions.  Like most art or music, a certain core or foundation can be ascertained with knowledge, and objective understanding can be attained with a little understanding on the listener's part.&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;&#8710;I recommend people unearth Mr. Lesch's photography to derive a deeper meaning to Roach's album, perhaps even complementing or improving the listening relationship.  If one can sit back and enjoy the haunted space invoked by these tracks, why not spend time enjoying the artifacts that inspired them.&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;&#8804;&#8805;[...] This was one of Steve Roach's best CD's.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end and was completely satisfied with it as it did live up to my high expectations of Steve Roach's amazing works.  If you are a fan or just enjoy ambient music this CD is definitely a good choice one will be happy with.  Steve's music is so soothing and relaxing in a way that gets your mind away from your everyday worries.  Overall an excellent CD and artist. This particular release by Steve Roach contains such a potent spiritual quality to it.  I own eight of his other works, but this is the cd I keep coming back to.  I can imagine that many people have releases by artists that mean much more than just music to them, but rather encompasses some facet of who they are, what they feel, and what they know.  That is really what Artifacts represents to me, and that tends to make it tough to actually describe this release or put into words that most people can relate to.  But I also feel that many people would understand if they were to listen to Artifacts in forthright, and especially in an enhanced setting for such music, like the desert southwest.  Definitely give this cd a shot. I think this is one of the best Steve Roach CDs. If you're a fan of Brian Eno's ON LAND, then you will most likely enjoy this. The sound of ARTIFACTS is mysterious, dark, ancient, murky, grumbling and ritualistic. Many deep  throbbing cantus firmuses, ascending and descending thrumms, and  underground winds which sound as if they're scabbing upon indigenous  instruments. I think it's deeper than WESTERN SPACES.","Alternative Rock,Europe,Progressive,Indie Rock,Electronica,Indie & Lo-Fi,Rock,Pop,New Age,Dance & Electronic,World Music,Ambient,Meditation,American Alternative,Electronic,Continental Europe",aural tourist roachs architecture often wonder journeys end steve roach one prolific artists spin weave almost endlessly churning new musical ideas allowing us look upon nature biogeographic zones namely desert atmosphere space admittedly hash older motifs contain previously released material habit wish would avoid artifacts doesnt quietly assume place terrace native ambience creates within timeframe minutes seconds roach transport timeroom tucson directly backyard begin imagine wilderness desert frogs near pond dim glow zodiacal light burning black blue horizon roach isnt keen giving tour desertscapes rather appreciation sands sounds breezes temperature humidity height skies expanding ab aural tourist roachs architecture wonder journeys end steve roach roach prolific artists spin weave endlessly churning new musical musical ideas ideas allowing look look upon nature biogeographic zones desert atmosphere space admittedly hash older motifs contain previously released material habit wish avoid artifacts quietly assume place terrace native ambience creates timeframe minutes seconds roach transport tucson directly backyard begin imagine wilderness desert frogs pond dim glow zodiacal zodiacal light light burning black blue horizon roach isnt keen tour appreciation sands sounds breezes temperature humidity height skies expanding
298,607,B0000007VC,"I didn't have high hopes when I purchased this.  I thought I was going to buy another ambient album that was just too boring and amorphous for me to latch on.  This album is neither of these.  It is rather a rich tapestry of  sounds that does pull you in.  While most of my music bores my friends to  tears this one always seems to garner the question, 'who is this?'.  It is  full, robust music that will leave you thinking.  The perfect place to  start with this man's music. &quot;Dreamtime Return&quot; and &quot;Streams and Currents&quot; are the only albums I own by Steve Roach. But I don't listen to his music a lot because I'm not really into ambient music. That's why I gave the album 4 stars but because the album is still worth listening to in the evening[like I said] I think it should earn 4 stars.Steve Roach's music is very soft, much different than the other artists I know like Patrick O' Hearn, Mars Lasar and Vangelis.&quot;Towards the Dream&quot; and &quot;The Continent&quot; are really the only songs on the album that have a beat to it and are more electronic but &quot;A Circular Ceremony&quot; continues some of the same sounds from The Continent. I think &quot;Songline&quot; had a bit of a beat to it but not one I could really tell. The rest of the album features the ambient music that Ray uses in most of his music.I think that in some ways this is a great album but in some ways it's not. I would recommend this album to everyone who likes ambient music but if you like electronic music I don't think this is the album for you. This album is an incredible journey through the Australian outback of your mind. I often put this on when I am working or am grumpy. It usually makes just about everything better. Steve Roach's ""Dreamtime Return"" is the first ambient soundscape album I purchased back in 1988.  Unfortunately, I was too young to appreciate its brilliance until my mind could fully realize the true diamond of pure ambience I had ""stumbled"" upon.  Initially, I was attracted to the cover, but failed to realize the timeless harmonies I had acquired, as evidence by its sustained price.  Roach was never able to duplicate the timeless, totally agreeable and mystic collection of tracks, all recorded in Australia with naturally made instruments, including the ubiquitous didgeridoo, pleasantly cast against a backdrop of cave echoes, water drops and indescribable, reverbial twangs that only Steve Roach could create.Included in this massive, 140-minute ageless collection are sounds of the Aborigines whom Roach befriended during his time in Australia recording ""Dreamtime Return,"" and their haunting, yet pleasant vocals burst forth on ""Red Twilight with the Old Ones,"" a track that could never be duplicated with such originality, such respect for the oldest civilization on earth.  I've found that the year doesn't matter.  I drop the attitude, close the door, put on the headphones with REPEAT ON, and drift off to a time and place from which I sometimes never want to leave.  Roach has struck gold with ""Dreamtime Return,"" and its perfectly balanced waveforms are nothing short of theraputic.  Stress, impatience, frustration, rage--all negative emotions--completely dissolve with even one uninterrupted session of ""Dreamtime Return,"" either Disc 1 or Disc 2 on its own or in tandem.  ""Dreamtime Return,"" in my book, can even cure insomnia with its matchless blend of pure musical frequencies, like dessert for the brain.  No other ambient album comes close, except perhaps ""Quiet Music,"" which caught the coattails of ""Dreamtime Return"", having very similar qualities, yet distinctly different patterns.But we must be clear on one thing: ""Dreamtime Return,"" or any other album that Steve has produced has nothing to do with ""New Age,"" and would probably be offended at such a label.  No.  Soundscape is the proper term, if the genre must be pegged, because it is exactly that.  Mr. Roach takes his sounds and shapes them in unison with the landscape.  No other artist of our time understands his own work better.  I'm sure that if I would have somehow missed Roach's recordings, either through neglect or indifference, the quality of my life and well-being would have suffered.  ""Dreamtime Return"" is the pure essence of what ambient soundscapes were meant to be, and it will never leave my collection.  It's as good today as it is tomorrow.  I feel sad for those listeners who fail to realize that. This is an amazing collection of pensive and calm pieces for synthesizer and various instruments (but it's not without a sense of unease or uncertainty, as per Eno's spot-on criticism of most ""New Age"" music). Roach's guiding musical principle seems to be the rhythms of the human body, in particular the act of breathing. Highlights are the ominous 30-minute landscape ""Looking for Safety"" and ""The Other Side,"" which contains a stupendous violin solo. Words cannot do this work of art any justice with this review. Spanning two-CDs, Steve Roaches 1988 magnum-opus ""Dreamtime Returns"" is arguably my favorite release of his to date even though I've since gotten other albums by him as well.I first heard this album when browsing through a local public library already having his ""Dreaming Now Then"" compilation. I felt it would be great to try this one out but I never expected it to be this wonderful. Though I can argue about some other songs from his previous and subsequent releases, there is a transcendance that is found on ""Dreamtime Returns"" that I don't think is as strong on his other albums. DR had me entranced the moment I first started playing it.""Songline"" is almost pure Aboriginal paradise with mostly traditional drums and a spine-tingling didjeridou, a strong contrast to the rest of the album. ""Circular Ceremony"" is so beautiful that it worked up a tear or two in my eyes. The song has a haunting, minor note melody combined with rain sticks to give a sense of stillness near an approaching thunderstorm. This is my favorite album of any artist of any genre. There are no words to describe the subtle moods and emotional depths of this work - you simply have to listen to it. If you're looking for a mysterious, hypnotic journey into the wild and primal world of the ancient Aborigines of Australia, then start your ""walkabout"" here. Before you begin to think that the title I've entered in is an exageration, try to remember the first time you listened to something which was so unusual that it truly tested the limits of your vocabulary. Much of the music from the Western classical tradition often produces such states of mind, as well as powerful performances of exotic forms of music. This recording by one of the most important musicians/composers of the past century also belongs in this lofty arena.By the mid-1980s, Steve Roach had successfully digested the bones of European electronic music; equal measures of Klaus Schulze, Vangelis, and to some extent Tangerine Dream. Towards the end of 1987, Roach was invited by Floridian photographer David Stahl to accompany him to Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, Australia to assist in the filming of Art of the Dreamtime, a documentary which was produced for PBS. The experience, which for Roach was a culmination of a childhood dream, was to alter both the course of his life as well as his music.Dreamtime Return was the great turning point of Roach's career, a line of demarcation separating the Berlin school-inspired electronic music he created since 1979 from a new primal, tribal-percussion based music rooted in his first experiences in the Australian Outback. The employment of electronic textures and structures can still be heard loud and clear, but it was now more organically-rooted and the emphasis on sampling becomes evident for the first time. Roach's influences at the time encapsulated everything from the piano-based soundscapes of Harold Budd to the Eastern/North African-influenced trumpet compositions of Jon Hassell, the latter being a former pupil of the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen.Throughout the 14 highly original compositions on this album, Roach brilliantly brings into focus what the ancient &quot;Dreamtime&quot; period in Australian Aboriginal prehistory may have been like, based both on Aboriginal legend as well as the latest geological data. From approximately 176,000 to roughly 20,000 years ago, the aborigines of Australia lived in a so-called &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; filled with Ice Age mammals and temperate rainforests and grasslands. There were a series of severe droughts occuring from roughly 30,000 to 20,000 years ago which resulted in widespread devestation throughout the continent and a resulting decline in the quality of Aboriginal life in general.The opening track &quot;Towards the Dream&quot; is a powerful sequencer-based piece that easily rivals the best efforts of Froese and Schulze. The following track &quot;The Continent&quot; is an ambitious and rock-solid expression of ardor--one can imagine flying high above the surface of the Earth observing the extraordinary landscapes of the Outback, but this may have been Roach's attempt to express what he felt when he got off the plane in Queensland and took his first glimpse of Australia.From these &quot;daytime&quot; pieces, Roach quickly moves into darker, deeper territory, from the aggressive(&quot;Songline&quot;) to the wistful (&quot;The Other Side&quot;) to the somber(&quot;Truth In Passing&quot;). The first disc concludes with one of the greatest compositions of his career: the near-melodic waltz &quot;Australian Dawn: The Quiet Earth Cries Inside&quot;, six minutes of utter genius. Never has there been a single piece of music outside of classical music which seems to epitomize the entire breadth of human emotion as in this one composition. The carefully-choosen synthesizer chords which arch and undulate here seem to express the decline of an ancient culture more perfectly than anything that Roach has created since, as well as a yearning for its return, hence recalling the album's title.The second disc opens with the 30-minute &quot;Looking For Safety&quot;, a sublime meditation on the peak of the Dreamtime. Here Roach interpolates DAT recordings of bizzare bird calls echoing off of canyon walls with a complex melody emphasizing hope over despair. &quot;Through a Strong Eye&quot; is the most experimental work from the album, with rich, convoluted synth textures cascading among one another in a dance of primal awe. &quot;The Ancient Day&quot;, a piece co-composed with Robert Rich, prominently features the dumbeck alongside Roach's ebb and flow of broadstroke synth colors, sequing to &quot;Red Twilight with the Old Ones&quot;, which incorporates authentic recordings of aboriginal songmen by Percy Trezise. Perhaps the most sparse composition, &quot;Red Twilight&quot; recreates the eerie glow of a nighttime ceremony designed to conjure up Dreamtime ancestors and spirits. &quot;The Return&quot; provides a reaffirming conclusion to this monumental recording, with a resounding final chord that tests the limits of your sound system.There are those who've described Steve Roach as the Bach of electronic music. This recording more than any other he's made would provide the best proof to this claim. Roach's style has changed a lot.  A lot of new ambient artists have come along since this release, such as Stars of the Lid, Deepspace [...]and Vidna Obmana, and yet this stands near the top of the field.  His style is more complex and layered now, but elements of this recording are still evident in some of his newer stuff, like mantram, and new life dreaming.Roach became a bit obsessed with the Australian Outback at one stage in his career, and you can hear that he nailed the feeling of the place quite well.  Having lived in Australia most of my life, I can hear what he was trying to do-the sense of starkness, and impenetrability in the deserts here is very tangible.  Very impressive Mr. Roach. I have A LOT of music by Steve Roach, not that this is something too difficult to acheive.  The man is VERY prolific.  To my mind, however, this double CD (re-released here) is one of the best sonic atmospheres ever written.  The music evokes the dreamtime of Australian Aborigine fame, and uses sounds and musical instrumentation of the Australian Outback as a basis for the entire concept.  When I first heard the music, I was living in Northern Canada, about as far from the Australian desert as one cen get.  It didn't matter.  The music is about an inward journey of thought and discovery that may have been inspired by one type of environment, but applies to the world as a whole.  I have played this music for friends from accountants and lawyers to teenagers and death rockers, and it is always a hit.  You do need to take the time to listen to the music and to get involved.  Since this is a double CD, don't expect to rush through in less than two hours.  If you take the time, you will be rewarded.  Originally released in 1988, this music  provided a foundation for many of Mr. Roach's environments which followed.  The other music, including &quot;Australia, Sound of the Earth&quot; and &quot;Origins&quot; explored similar spaces,  but this CD remains the masterpiece. I strongly agree with the other 5 star reviews on Dreamtime Return and hope we can push it to 5 full stars average: This is the Steve Roach album people should start with.  It grows with every iteration and has almost become a sacred treasure in my collection (among others, I own almost all Steve Roach CDs).As a word of caution though: The first 10 times or so I could not really find access to this record, since it is more a subtile painting of moods than something that catches your attention for active listening.  But this is one of the few records that become better each time (in this regard similar to Peter Gabriel's UP or Klaus Schulze's Timewind). 3 1/2High notch astro-ambiance blends lush synths with soothing tribal rhythms in a way many New Ager's (including Roach himself) have tried in vain to emulate since, though usually instead amounting to little more then the cliche this type of music has become to the market. It is not entirely solid compositionally; sometimes the mechanical shallowness rears its head after one too many loops, but when tracks come together like a centerpiece track ""The Other Side"", the album is  worth hearing. This is one of the great Steve Roach albums.  It is a must own, but make sure you buy the remastered version, which Steve remastered himself.  If you're a new progressive-ambient listener, this is a great place to start.  Five stars.  If I could, I'd give it more. This is sacred music, from an artist who has captured the sounds of the earth's respiration, of our mind's synaptic firings, of the soul's aspiring. I am grateful that for more than a decade I have had ""Dreamtime Return"" for moments when I've desired a clear mind, a grateful heart and a tranquil soul. The soundscapes Steve Roach creates on Dreamtime Return are out of this world. They'll grab you instantly and by the time this double-disc set comes to an end you'll be amazed and stunned by it. This is Roach in his finest hour and it's definitely the finest hour of ambient music. This is a must have for every ambient music fan.... I hate the rubric 'new age' and would not confine this extraordinary work  to it.  I first heard this CD in '90 and return to it frequently.  Next to  Eno's &quot;Music for Airports&quot; and &quot;Plateaux of Mirror&quot;, it  is probably my favorite space-music collectible. A lot of offerings in this  category are repetitive and sound either like machines mating, or worse,  some blissed out Marin County hippie doodling on a synth, but 'Dreamtime  Return' is art.Whether approached as an active listening experience, or  simply enjoyed for its utility as a chill disc, Roach satisfies on both  levels.  Moreover, certain sections instantly return one to any mystical  states of which one may have a priori knowledge.  This CD will put you  right there, friends. Simply one of the best space/newage/ambient works ever pressed, Steve Roach's expanded score lends itself to the ultimate relaxation or chill-party CD.  It's an arresting work - the man works miracles with electronics and sheets of sounds.  Along with the same decade's ""Chronos"" by Michael Stearns, and Don Slepian's psycoactive, hypnotic, let's-get-back-to-Nirvana masterpiece, ""Sea of Bliss,"" Roach's two CD epic will take you places few musics can.  THIS IS GREAT! In the relatively brief annals of so-called ambient electronic music, this engaging and hypnotic 1988 two-disc release might be one of the few that can rightly be deemed a ""classic"". Aboriginal rhythms, drones, dumbeks and didgeridoos combine to evoke a keen sense of place (the Australian outback) and a spirit of timelessness. This is generally considered Steve Roach's masterpiece.  While he certainly hasn't let his standards slide with his most recent albums (ex. `Midnight Moon' or `Atmospheric Conditions'), this is definitely the peak  of his aboriginal-influenced works.  I find the second disc to be  particularly beautiful and often sleep with it on a continuous loop.  The  lack of repetitive rhythms is extremely relaxing.  I would highly recommend  this album if you're looking for your first ambient recording.  Beautiful. Hear the chants, mezmorizing rythems, and dare to remember what we really are.  Go to places our elders  knew of but feared whatmight result.  Thank you Steve and may we all meet in the Dreamtime. Maybe I'm ignorant about electronic music, but I've heard a lot of symphonic rock and new age, and I can hardly denominate &quot;music&quot; to this CD. Poor recording quality adds to what is a mistake in my  collection. It is simply one of the most moving, engaging, and far reaching musical  works you will ever hear. This is as primal as it gets! Get it! I am just starting to collect Steve Roach.  I haven't been fond of everything so far - but this one is a hit with me. The second half of the cd is what i bought it for, very deeply calming. I can see why people call this album a masterpiece.  The music is not melodic, so it will require a taste for this sort of stuff.  It doesn't resemble the usual &quot;electronic&quot; genre (Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis) because of the overall lack of melody... nor does it resemble something like improvisational Shakuhachi flute or piano, which also could be called &quot;unmelodic&quot; but in a different sense (lacking a predefined musical structure).I voted it a &quot;4&quot; because I really haven't acquired much of a taste for this sort of music.  You may be tempted to vote me a &quot;not helpful&quot; because some 'personal preference' went into this review, and I didn't just rave about it like everyone else... but before you do, plz ask yourself, was it helpful at all in making a purchasing decision? Brillant ""travelogue"" music, Steve's ambient excursions into the landscape are beautiful and evocative. This journey is into the Australian outback complete with all sorts of sounds from nature and Aboriginal instruments just in the right measure. A prolific artist, but quality varies with release, this is a classic, all the songs flow together well, the overall package is tightly bound.Whenever I want to go on a ""walkabout"", this is the disc I pick up first.","Alternative Rock,Europe,Progressive,Indie Rock,Electronica,Indie & Lo-Fi,Rock,Pop,New Age,Dance & Electronic,World Music,Ambient,Meditation,American Alternative,Electronic,Continental Europe",didnt high hopes purchased thought going buy another ambient boring amorphous latch neither rather rich tapestry sounds pull bores friends tears one always seems garner question full robust leave thinking perfect place start mans quot dreamtime return quot quot streams currents quot steve roach dont listen lot im really ambient thats gave stars still worth listening evening like said think earn stars steve roachs soft much different artists know like patrick hearn mars lasar vangelis quot towards dream quot quot continent quot really high high hopes hopes purchased thought buy ambient boring amorphous latch rich tapestry sounds pull bores friends tears seems garner question full robust leave thinking perfect place start mans dreamtime dreamtime return return quot quot streams currents quot steve roach roach listen lot really ambient stars worth listening said think earn stars steve steve roachs roachs soft different artists know mars vangelis quot dream quot quot continent quot really
299,608,B0000007VE,"Amazing disc.  Minimalism that is expressionistic.  Ever shut your eyes and stare at the stars and red clouds that dance beneath your eye lids?  World's Edge would be the soundtrack to that display.  New Age that is etheral to the 10th degree.  It is a soundscape that looks to the heavens (starry night) for its inspiration, but is rooted in something that is cthonic and primordial.  Another Steven Roach fan who is a friend of mine prefers the &quot;Early Man&quot; album to this album.  Uh uh.  No way.  What &quot;Early Man&quot; does for a jurassic feel, &quot;World's Edge&quot; would be the audio experience that comes from sensory deprivation.  It can reach inside you and squeeze your heart a bit too tightly if you let it.  That sounds extreme, but there is something to this disc that can send the listener on an astral journey, if you let it..... early steve roach; deep, spacey, infinite!  this is what space music is all about; dreamy, drifting. you will make this your top shelf selection. Among Steve Roach's vast and brilliant catalog of ambient, or &quot;space music&quot; recordings, very few are less than superlative and a select few transcend the rest to establish the new high water mark by which all other ambient recordings are measured. 'World's Edge' is just such an album.His first true masterpiece was the double album 'Dreamtime Return'. With 'World's Edge', Steve Roach moved into a new realm that integrated ambient textures with tribal rhythm's to completely transport the listener to, (hopefully without sounding too metaphysical) a new plain of existence. The first disc is especially effective in creating this feeling of escape, while the second disc is one long piece that is more introspective as it delves into the inner soul of the listener.Once again, I must disagree with Mr. Moodindigo2 who seems to have completely missed the point of these albums. This music isn't about sensory deprivation: rather they are a complex and moving exercise in TOTAL IMMERSION. If you take the time to listen critically, you cannot help but be totally carried away by the intricate structures and subtle counterpoints of the music. I would suggest that Moodindigo2 give it another listen and try to stay awake this time.This album is the second masterpiece in the triumvirate, but I must also agree with Moodindigo's &quot;friend&quot; who ranks Steve Roach's Early Man (yet another double CD) as the zenith of his career to date, and the third true masterpiece in his catalog. Buy them all and experience 6 discs of the best ambient music available anywhere. Excellent ambient....very unique.  I use it on low volume to go to sleep every night.

301,610,B0000007VS,"Hosianna Mantra is truly a wondrous album.  The first three tracks (making up the original side one - remember when albums had side one and side two?) are incredible - the woman's voice is orgasmically beautiful and the fluid  flowing sublime electric guitar is mystically magical - I never knew an  electric guitar could sound that rapturous and carry a melody along so  well.  The remaining tracks (side two if you're following closely) are more  subdued, but again very lovely - some of the best ambient music ever before  there was a genre for it.  I'm also quite fond (not as much as Hosianna  Mantra, but who cares) of Tantric songs - an album from a few years later,  that's very peaceful and sedate, yet intense and edgy as well - you can't  go wrong with this CD. a lovely CD. A couple of slightly repetative songs but a beautiful  collection of calming sounds with a great depth of soundspace. Don't be put off by the title. It is not naff and it's a great listen for something a bit different. Hosianna Mantra has to be one of my favorite albums ever. It's a pity that it, along with the rest of Popol Vuh's catalog, is virtully unheard of in the United States. The songs on Hosianna Mantra are beautiful and among the most spiritual pieces I've ever heard. The 10-minute title track is a standout, combining angelic vocals with piano and watery guitar to great effect. And Departure is one of the more beautiful pieces of music ever, in my opinion. Along with this album comes the later Tantric Songs, a solid but not spectacular effort. The two Angel of the Air songs are very beautiful, however. If you hate New Age-ish music, then you probably wouldn't like this. Not to say that this is New Age, but it is more meditative than most (or all) &quot;rock&quot; music. It's worth checking out otherwise. Those of you expecting some pencil-necked macrobiotic New Ager doodling on a casio next to a cage full of exotic birds and a couple of running taps - be warned. This monumental work from the Teutonic genius of Florian Fricke is true ambient music  - as distinct from most of the ubiquitous aural valium that poses under the dreaded department store moniker of 'New Age/ Ambient / Relaxation. Not that this music isn't relaxing (it can be profoundly so ), but there is a vast textural range here that somehow addresses the more obscure and refined emotions within.Popol Vuh have been composing haunting soundtrack music for many years - through their fruitful artistic alliance with that iconoclastic German director Werner Herzog - in films such as Aguirre, Nosferatu and Heart of Glass. Tracks 'Kyrie' and 'Hosianna Mantra' are reminiscient of Some of Jerry Garcia's extraordinary electric guitar on the 'Zabriskie Point' soundtrack, while others evoke the timeless, universal longings of the great spiritual traditions - through an impeccable marriage of Eastern and Western instrumentation. I know it's been said ad nauseum in respect of many other albums, but this gorgeous soundscape is truly 'timeless'. I particularly liked this compilation because of the beautiful melodies and instruments used. There are many tracks with an exotic sound, due to the sitar which can be vaguely heard,and the ethereal vocals of Djong Yun.""Departure"" is a very beautiful and atmospheric melody which is characterised by the lyrical sound of Robert Eliscu's oboe. In all, this compilation of these two albums ""Tantric songs"" and ""Hosianna Mantra"" is very relaxing and soothing. Even long tracks like ""Brothers of darkness-sons of light"" and ""Hosianna Mantra"" do not lose their melodic quality despite their long duration. At 76:31, this is the single best value for Popol Vuh fans you will find  anywhere.  It reproduces, apparently in entirety, two Popol Vuh albums,  Tantric Songs (also Die Nacht der seele) and Hosianna Mantra.The tantric  songs are fairly short pieces that present a variety of meditative  environments.  I can't speak to any technical details that they may embody,  not being a practitioner of tantric yoga.  Called songs, the vocals are by  and large wordless tones or chants with the punctuation of electronic  keyboard music and effects.Having just listened to Die nacht der seele  and this CD back-to-back I am fairly sure that the same material is on both  CDs, and would therefore advise against purchasing the former separately  (unless like me you gotta have it all).There are several &quot;musical  references&quot; to music contained on other albums, most notably the  Nosferatu soundtrack albums (the title track of the Bruder des schattens is  quoted in its entirety).  If you like this stuff as much as I do the  quoting won't bother you.  If you don't you won't find so much of it that  you may not be as satisfied..To date, as far as I know, Hosianna Mantra  has not been separately released on CD, and so this is the only place you  can get that material.  Hosianna Mantra contains a higher content of female  vocals and actual sung words than other Popol Vuh albums -- more like their  Seligpreisung, Sei Stille, Hohenlied Salamos, and Einsjager albums than the  soundtrack albums and related material.It's good stuff.  It's rather  light, for Popol Vuh, in a sense that a room in a house in the mountains  with east-facing windows might be bright on a winter's morning.  The  Hosianna Mantra material may lack the deep grounding sound of the Tantric  Songs and other material but certainly represents an interesting aspect of  the group's music.Details:  Tracks are Mantra of the touching of the  heart; Mantra of the touching of the earth; Angel of the Air part 1; Angel  of the Air part 2; In the realm of shadow; Wanderer through the night;  Listen he who ventures; Brothers of darkness -- sons of light; Ah!; Kyrie;  Hosianna-Mantra; Departure; Blessing; Devotion 1; Not High in Heaven; and  Devotion II, for a total time of 76:31.","Alternative Rock,Progressive,Electronica,Krautrock,Pop,New Age,Dance & Electronic,Rock,Meditation,Electronic,Progressive Rock",hosianna mantra truly wondrous first three making original side one remember side one side two incredible womans voice orgasmically beautiful fluid flowing sublime electric guitar mystically magical never knew electric guitar could sound rapturous carry melody along well remaining side two youre following closely subdued lovely best ambient ever genre im also quite fond much hosianna mantra cares tantric years later thats peaceful sedate yet intense edgy well cant go wrong cd lovely cd couple slightly repetative beautiful collection calming sounds great depth soundspace dont put title naff great listen something bit different hosianna mantra one favorite hosianna hosianna mantra mantra truly wondrous original side side one remember side side one side side two incredible womans voice orgasmically beautiful fluid fluid flowing flowing sublime electric electric guitar guitar mystically magical knew electric electric guitar guitar sound rapturous carry melody remaining side youre following closely subdued lovely best ambient genre quite fond hosianna hosianna mantra mantra cares tantric years years later later peaceful sedate intense edgy go wrong wrong cd lovely cd couple slightly beautiful collection calming sounds great depth title naff great listen bit different hosianna hosianna mantra mantra favorite

Hudson has created numerous albums exploring his control of the many  vocolizations with the didg, but this album centers on his singular ability  to excite, entrance and explore the areas of ambience with one of the  oldest and fantastic instruments in the world. 'tis true that human society has long been exploring the drone sounds...Being entranced must ve had a very special part in the life of an early man: hunting, procreation, celebration to name a few activities that are ""entrancing"". So we are dealing with the human for whom the ""reason"" hasn't played such an important part as it is for us now...Listening to D. Hudson takes you back to that state of mind, and while there are other methods, like dance, chant etc. a didg method is a sure method - no brainwash here...just a pure tunnelling and convexing matrix. I too am a beginner didge player, and i mainly bought this cd as a tool to help me get ideas to improve my playing, so you kinda have to have expieriance with this cd to really enjoy it.

303,616,B00000085H,"The 1910 Fruitgum Company was one of two highly successful - if brief - ""bubblegum"" groups created for Buddah Records, launched in New York in 1967 by Art Kass and managed by Neil Bogart, from the fertile minds of Super K Productions founders Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz after they departed the Cameo/Parkway concern where they had enjoyed some minor success with a group from Mansfield, Ohio called The Ohio Express.In 1968 this team would have those two groups going head to head (The Ohio Express relocated to Buddah in 1968) in delivering the sort of music that drove the more supercilious critics at Rolling Stone Magazine up the wall. The problem for RSM was, enough of the buying public and juke box players loved them as they went on to rack up 14 hits singles between them in just two short years, along with a number of successful albums.Comprising The 1910 Fruitgum Co. at the outset were lead Mark Gutkowski, drummer Floyd Marcus, bass Steve Mortkowitz, guitarist Frank Jeckell, and guitarist Pat Karwan - all members of a New Jersey-based group that had functioned for a while in 1965 as Jeckell & The Hydes and then The Odyessy (no records). Kasenetz-Katz would, however, freely rotate others in and out over the next two years. In fact, members of this group and The Ohio Express even got together as The Kasenetx-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus, with Joey Levine of The Ohio Express handling the lead, to take Quick Joey Small (Run Joey Run) to # 25 in late 1968.This package from Collectables has all seven of The 1910 Fruitgum Co.'s Billboard Pop Hot 100 hits, along with five of their B-sides, with excellent sound reproduction and informative notes - although not on the scale you'd get from Ace of London - written by Mark Marymont. Their first,  Simon Says, based upon the ancient game Simple Simon Says, reached # 4 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in February/March 1968 on Buddah 24 b/w Reflections From The Looking Glass. However, their follow-up May I Take A Giant Step (Into Your Heart), stumbled in May, only managing a # 63 on Buddah 39 b/w (Poor Old) Mr. Jensen.But they bounced back in August with another tune based upon an old favourite children's game, 1,2,3 Red Light which, with backing by The Trade Winds, reached # 5 on Buddah 54 b/w Sticky, Sticky. The thing is, the only original in this offering was Gutkowski, and even he didn't appear in the November 1968 # 37 Goody Goody Gumdrops, which featured Billy Carl as the lead on Buddah 71 b/w Candy Kisses.In 1969 various members would register three hit singles: Indian Giver - # 6 in February on Buddah 91 b/w Pow Wow; Special Delivery - # 38 in May/June on Buddah 114 b/w No Good Annie; and The Train - # 57 in September on Buddah 130 b/w Eternal Light. Another single, When We Get Married could only manage a # 118 on the Hot 100 Bubble Under charts b/w Baby Bret (Baby Sweet?) on Buddah 246. Only Eternal Light and Pow Wow are omitted from this volume.Tracks 2 and 4 are from the April 1968 # 162 album ""Simon Says"" (Buddha BDS-5010), while track 12 is from the October 1968 # 163 album ""1, 2, 3, Red Light"" (Buddha BDS-5022).Some of the free-changing members deployed by Kasenetz-Katz at Buddah were: James Camando, Mike Edell, Curtis Gashlin, Rich Gomez, Mike Ilnicki, Dennis Kubala, Mike LaVolpe, Randy Monaco, Rusty Oppenheimer, Larry Ripley, Bruce Shay, Michael Stoppiello, Charles Tedesco, Phil Thorstenson, Chuck Travis, David Turinsky and Stephen Young. Do you have 1910 fruitgum company indian giver It's undeniable the Fruit Gum 1910, Ohio Express and Tommy Roe headed this genre best known as bubble gum music that literally invaded parties, summer happenings, emerging discotheques, and countless friendly meetings. Somehow, this genre followed the traces of Summer Groups as Beach Boys and The Mammas and the Papas. There were a considerable of bands that turned around with variants. We may remember Tommy James, The Rascals, The Foundations, Buchanan brothers or Canned heat among the most emblematic bands. Of course, it was easy listening music without major complications, and the fortunate blending with that stellar moment on stage respect the soul music ( The Four Tops, Diana ross and The Supremes, Temptations, Wilson Picket, Steve Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, Jr. Walker and The All stars; Otis reading) constituted a true creative explosion in the most accurate sense of the word.I was part of that generation and despite the fact this music may sound dated for the newcomer listeners, one senses a certain ingenuity so typical of that age. Nevertheless you should approach this ensemble so filled of joyful expression.One more thing to make you reflect: in those times, you must win the race through auditory channels and not as the actual times, where you buy music through the visual channels. This CD contains some of the best songs by the quintessential bubblegum group, The 1910 Fruitgum Company.  The group had three big hits: ""Simon Says"", ""1,2,3, Red Light"" and ""Indian Giver"".  As you can see from these song titles, most of the Fruitgums hits were based on children's games and sayings.  Sure, this music may be juvenile, but it's a lot of fun.  I would recommend this CD to fans of bubblegum music.  I wanted to mention a couple of things here.  The songs on the CD are in stereo, other than ""Sticky, Sticky"" and ""Reflections From the Looking Glass"", which are in mono.  Also, the liner notes here claim that Joey Levine was the lead singer of the 1910 Fruitgum Company.  This is simply not true.  Mark Gutkowski sang lead on most of the Fruitgums hits.  Joey Levine sang lead on most of the Ohio Express hits.  Although Levine did sing lead on one song here, ""Baby Bret"", which was a b-side.  ""Baby Bret"" also has one of the strangest endings of a pop song I ever heard.  The song fades out, and then there is a brief comedy routine about Superman. A few song-selection differences separates this collection from the similarly-packaged BMG ""Best Of"" (They both include the fabulous 'Indian Giver' picture, but this time it gets the cover). Whereas the BMG disc concentrates on the cute song titles (it seems to have been programmed for the titles alone), this one is more interested in the music. Where else can you get the b-side ""Sticky, Sticky"" except on an old 45? (this is a great song by the way, just a studio time-filler of course, but wonderfully monotonous and straight-faced silly). The history of the band is probably better chronicled in the other package, but they're both worth buying if bubblegum is your thing.

304,617,B0000008BJ,"I'm also looking for Mary in the Morning. It is surprising the song is not on the greatest hits as it's still played on the radio. Of the two albums available, this is the better buy. It includes the complete songs from two lps, most importantly, &quot;Who Will Answer&quot; and &quot;Try To Remember&quot; which are not on the album MY CUP RUNNETH  OVER. I really wanted to have this on CD - have had it for years on a 45!  It does not seem to be &#34;remastered&#34; but it fills the bill, so to speak, so am glad to have it. My wife, Sherry, that has a voice of an angel, chose this song as our special song for each other.  It is simple, but conveys the feelings that we have for each other.  We will have been married 47 years as of July 30 of 2013.  I still think that she is an angel that God sent to me for our journey to the ""Promised Land"". If you are an Ed Ames fan, this CD is pure joy.  It is in my car CD player and it is played regularly.  The richness of Ed's voice is not only a joy to listen to, but never fails to add joy to my day.  The same can be said for another Ames CD in my office CD player.  A must for all Ed Ames fans. this is exactly what I wanted and expected.  Ed Ames has teh voice and songs to soothe a soul.  Good winter listening here in Ohio. I disagree in the strongest possible terms with the reviewer who called the ""But Who's To Answer"" song almost laughable.  In my opinion, it's the highlight of this cd.  However, I was fortunate to see Ed Ames performing live in the mid 1990s where he performed this song a hundred times better than it sounds on this cd.  That's not as much a criticism of the way the song sounds on this cd as much as how his voice (it was almost operatic at the live performance) improved with time and apparent training as well as what seemed to be additional or changed lyrics which were perhaps updated for the times but the socially conscious spirit of the song stayed the same.  His performance and the lyrics of that song moved me so much that if I ever make it as a singer and can obtain the lyrics and music to that song, I will make it my theme song.  ""Watch What Happens"" is an underperformed song that is another highlight of this cd.  I hope Ed Ames will continue to perform and perhaps a recording of one of his later renditions (1990s to present) will come out on cd. Got this for one or two titles and found that I like almost every cut on the album.  Just an excellent voice.  Sings a lot of songs that were ""his"" but a lot of these are songs made famous by others.  He brings a great touch to them. This is a replacement for an old cassette and is more enjoyable over the years.I introduced Ed Ames to a technician at Georgetown Hospital and he was amased that Mingo  (from the Daniel Boone tv show|) could sing like that. Ed Ames is an unrivalled singer among the greatest male singers. And for many reasons: his absolute professionalism, his deep humanity that transcends his singing, his emotional, tasty, gracious, evocative style,  the conviction he puts in each song, viewed as a work in itself. His voice  is like the seasons, being like a light breeze or capable of thundering. He  has the classicism and elegance of Bing Crosby, but he can really belt! It  must be said that he made over 30 disks, and therefore the songs of the CD,  though representative, are far from exhausting all what he sang, changing  each song, even the more modern one, into a definite standard. Ed Ames was  a tremendous, impressive artist who must be rediscovered and considered as  one of this century's greatest singers. He must not be seen just as one of  those retro singers. He is a great  and rare entertainer, capable of  bringing joy or stirring the soul.  BUY THIS CD and let's hope that his  numerous other disks will be released as CDs too! He deserves the best! I love this cd.  I listen to it in my car and every song is great.  He not only sings the song he masters it.  His voice is fantastic.  This cd is a must have if you love ballads as I do.  I wish all of his lp's would be on cd. i am looking for &quot;mary in the Morning by ed ames.. where can i find itwhere can i find &quot;mary in the morning&quot; by ED Ames??/ I like Ed Ames' voice better than any other male vocalists that I'm familiar with.  Some of the instrumental parts of his songs on this album are dated, from before my time, but these two albums overall aged very well. I didn't know many of these songs, because . . . .they are from before my time. I wish more of his albums would be restored and released. I have everything there is so far.  It's a nice variety of music on this CD. Ed Ames has to be the most underrated singers of the last century. His voice is as close to flawless - clear, full and resonant.  The musical selections perfectly suit his style. I grew up watching him as Mingo on ""Daniel Boone"" and listening to his music on both 33rpm and 8 track. On CD he sounds better than ever. He must surely be considered a ""sleeper"" who could still support a strong niche today. Ed Ames originally made his name as one of the Ames brothers but continued as a solo singer after his brothers quit. He had several solo hits in the America during the sixties, where his albums also sold well. His hits were usually songs from musicals, but he made no impact in Britain. On this CD, you get two of his original albums plus two of his other hits.Who will answer, My cup runneth over, Try to remember and Time time were among Ed's American hits. All of them are included here. He had other hits that are not included here. Most of the other songs here are covers.Among the great covers of contemporary pop songs here are Blowing in the wind (Bob Dylan), Yesterday (Beatles), Monday Monday (Mamas and Papas), Massachusetts (Bee Gees), Cherish (Association), The other man's grass is always greener (Petula), Can't take my eyes off you (Andy Williams) and There's a kind of hush (Herman's hermits, later covered by the Carpenters).Show songs are also well represented, including In the arms of love (from What did you do in the war Daddy), Au revoir (from Sherry), Watch what happens (from The umbrellas of Cherbourg), Melinda (from On a clear day you can see forever), True love (from High society) and Edelweiss (from Sound of music).This is a wonderful collection. I wish more of his original albums were available on CD. A great CD that showcases the fantastic talents Of Ed Ames. Every selection is a hit. You will listen and enjoy this CD over and over again. I really like this CD.  As I listened to it it took me back in time when I had his album on 8 track.  Great CD, would recommned it. I love it. I never had the cd Who Will Answer but had the old record of My Cup Runneth Over.I like both the cds on this one cd.I would highly recommend this if you are a Ed Ames fan.Susan P. Keefe I have been a fan of Ed Ames since the 60's when his solo albums began appearing....and still consider him one of the finest vocalists of this century--largely undiscovered for the talent that he is.  Perhaps his talent as an actor helped him put such emotion in his songs, but I still get goose bumps listening to some of those old (now scratchy) albums.  I too would like to see much more of his work appear on CD. The only real problem with this two-fer album is that it has a split personality.  The first half of the album is Ed's 1967 ""Who Will Answer"" album, arranged by Perry Botkin, Jr.  Basically songs of the 60s, with a very slight protest theme.  Then, the second half of the album is a very typical soft vocal set.  Both are transferred to DVD reasonably well (no complaints, even when listening with headphones).  But if you really like one of the albums, you'll probably not like the other very much.  Totally different concepts and totally different musical arrangements.I for one am partial in favor of the ""Who Will Answer"" album, so I was very happy that it came out on CD after all these years.  The title song is a strong and forceful protest song, with a very clever arrangement that varied from Gregorian chant-like sections to a pounding modern beat.  And I give Ed Ames (and staid old RCA) credit for recording such a hip (for the time) protest single...which by the way, is followed by an equally strong ""Blowing In The Wind"".  In both, Ed's voice is tremendous.  ""Monday, Monday"" and ""Massachusetts"" are also very good and relatively reminiscent of the original recordings by the original artists to be familiar and feel good.  I was less impressed with ""Yesterday"", ""I Wanna Be Free"", and ""Cherish""...maybe just a feeling that at the time they were done to death...but there's nothing wrong with the recordings.  ""The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener"" was certainly upbeat, and it worked, but the same cannot be said for ""There's A Kind Of A Hush"".  What part of ""hush"" didn't Ames and Botkin understand when they did the drums to loud singing to death?  On the other hand, in ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"", there's a nice alternation between a lilting performance and a strong beat.  All in all this is a great album that showcases a strong, rich baritone.The second half of the album covers some other Ames recordings, some very nice -- ""My Cup Runneth Over"" (although Ed comes on a bit strong in a couple of places...but boy, could he hold a note!), ""Watch What Happens"" (certainly classier than Sinatra's version), ""Melinda"", ""Bon Soir Dame"" (very nice tune and vocal), ""There's A Time For Everything"" (really nice arrangement), and another of his hits -- ""Time, TIme"".  I was less impressed with the remaining cuts, and although he was well know for the recording, I found his phrasing on ""Try To Remember"" to be annoying.  ""Edelweiss"" was disappointing, as well, with the early and later parts of song excellent, but the middle too powerful.  ""Don't Blame Me"" and ""True Love"" very disappointing.  Overall, a moderately good album.But, of course, I suppose others with a different musical taste will admire the latter half of the album and dismiss the first half.  Ah well...something for everyone. This CD is a good representation of Ed Ame's music.  It is a shame that more of his recordings haven't been made available on CDs.  I agree with the other reviews shown here as to his talent.  It has not gotten the appreciation that he deserves.  Buy this CD! I enjoyed the selections on this double album CD. The quality was very good.","Classic Country,Oldies,Country,Traditional Vocal Pop,Traditional Pop,Pop,Broadway & Vocalists,Vocal Pop",im also looking mary morning surprising greatest hits still played radio two available better buy includes complete two lps importantly quot answer quot quot try remember quot cup runneth really wanted cd years seem remastered fills bill speak glad wife sherry voice angel chose special simple conveys feelings married years july still think angel god sent journey promised land ed ames fan cd pure joy car cd player played regularly richness eds voice joy listen never fails add joy day b looking surprising greatest greatest hits hits played radio available better buy includes complete lps importantly answer quot quot try remember quot cup really wanted cd years seem remastered fills bill speak glad wife sherry voice angel chose special simple conveys feelings married years july think angel god sent journey promised land ed ames ames fan cd pure joy car cd cd player player played regularly richness eds voice joy listen fails add joy day
305,618,B0000008DN,"They are known for 'In The Still Of The Night"" but listen to ""I'll Be Seeing You"" and ""To The Aisle"". You will play them over and over again. Some reviewers are ticked over the omission of Our Anniversary and I'll Get Along Somehow. Yes, they did those songs on one of their vinyl albums years ago, but this is labeled, after all, ""The Five Satins Sing Their Greatest Hits."" And like it or not, a ""hit"" was then regarded as a single release - initially on 78 rpm and then on 45 rpm - that did well enough in sales, air play, and juke box play to get an artist onto the various Billboard charts - whether Pop, Country or R&B.;THAT is what they all strove to achieve because THAT is what put them on the map, so to speak. And this group had 7 charted hits (three of them with the same song) and, along with their B-sides, they're all here. From the perspective of a collector of hit singles it just doesn't get any better, and this is one time Collectables did it right.Their first, In The Still Of The Nite, was written by group member and lead singer Fred Parris [the others were Al Denby, Jim Freeman, and Eddie Martin with pianist Jessie Murphy], and recorded in a New Haven church basement. For my money I can't think of a more beautiful ballad to emanate from the mid-1950s. With the upbeat The Jones Girl as the flipside, and first released on the Standard label before being picked up and re-released as Ember 1005, it made it to # 3 R&B; and # 24 Billboard Pop Top 100 in the fall of 1956. It's also been written in several places that it ""continues to hang somewhere in the air over New York City."" I can believe it.With Parris in the Army and stationed in Japan, Bill Baker sang lead on their next hit, another tender ballad called To The Aisle, which, b/w the jumped-up I Wish I Had My Baby, reached # 5 R&B; and # 25 Top 100 in August 1957. More than a year would then pass before their next hit, Shadows, billed to The 5 Satins. By now Parris was back and had replaced Baker and, with his lead, Shadows peaked at # 27 R&B; and # 87 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in November 1959 b/w an equally-slow tune, Toni My Love.Early in 1960 Ember re-released In The Still Of The Nite and it charted again, going to # 81 Hot 100 in January. Five months later they reached back to an old Bing Crosby hit and saw I'll Be Seeing You level off at # 79 Hot 100 in May b/w A Night Like This. Their last charter for 21 years then came in 1961 with yet another re-release of In The Still Of The Night which, with the added words ""/I'll Remember"" on the label, made it to # 99 Hot 100 in January.Parris then formed a new group, The New Yorkers and, for the Wall label, had a # 69 Hot 100 called Miss Fine in May 1961 b/w (At Night) Dream A Little Dream. In 1975 he emerged again, this time as Black Satin Featuring Fred Parris, to take Everybody Stand And Clap Your Hands (For The Entertainer) to # 49 R&B; for Buddah Records, b/w Hey There Pretty Lady.Then, in 1982, Fred Parris & The Five Satins had a medley called Memories Of Days Gone By reach # 71 Hot 100, The songs covered were: Sixteen Candles/Earth Angel/Only You (And You Alone)/A Thousand Miles Away/Tears On My Pillow/Since I Don't Have You/In The Still Of The Nite (I'll Remember). The dlip was Loving You (Would Be The Sweetest Thing). Twelve years after that, on August 10, 1994, To The Aisle feature vocalist Bill Baker died of lung cancer at age 58.I can't find any fault with this great CD which has to be one of the best bargains offered by Amazon. I remember these songs playing everywhere when I was quite young. I had an older brother, who with  his friends, would play them all the time. Of course I was too young to be &quot;in love&quot; but I can still remember  my brother and his friends dancing to them and looking as if they could  hold each other all night. Now I have this copy for myself and I can't get  enough of it! It is also nice to buy a CD that has all good songs on it,  not just a few. Hats off to the &quot;FIVE SATINS!&quot; why isn't &quot;weeping willow &quot;by the five satins included in this cd? The 5 Satins are probably best known for the classic ""In The Still Of The Night"" but they had a lot more to offer, as this CD demonstrates.Plenty of classic Doo Wop here including their hit ""To The Aisle"" and there is some great R&B; too.My only complaint is the minimal liner notes but that's just quibbling.All the tunes are the original versions and the recording quality is just fine. When I always heard the songs that the Five Satins sang it was always so smooth and nice I enjoy this cd espeically ""Our Anniversary"" it was just a delight to hear that song over and over.  This is a very good cd with their hits that is still played on the rare doo wop stations over the weekend.  I really enjoy listenig to this cd. I am extremely pleased with this CD. 24 songs by the Five Satins on one CD at such a bargain price. If you are a fan of music from the 1950's and early 1960's, this CD is for you. If you like &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot;, this CD is for you. The great vocal harmony by the Five Satins is well captured by the excellent sound quality of this CD. I was disappointed in this CD. Recognize very few songs, and I question if they are by the original 5 Satins. Sounded similar, but don't think it's the real deal. Would not buy this again, and would make sure any oldies I buy say that it contains original artist. great tunes from the birth of rock and roll.  I listen to it very often.  Brought back lots of memories. Just now read Mr. O'Leary of Canada's commentary re my original review contained here of this great album, (submitted many moons ago, which shows how much of my life force and attention is given over to this stuff) wherein I lament the exclusion (on the CD) of two singles from the original album. Just for the record, I am not an ""oldies"" wannabe.  I grew up with this music and I also own today the original vinyl 33 of this specific album, so I know whereof I speak. (said album featuring the exact cover photo as the CD)The reason for the comment in my initial review was that I hoped to get a CD version which duplicated the original album and included these two neat titles.  And George, if you aren't familiar with them, I suggest that you check out Master Tapes volume 2 here on Amazon, where you will find the items in question.  Yes, they did record them and yes, the songs were on this original album. By the way, the original only had 14 cuts; besides the 2 aforementioned songs, ""Again"" and ""Moonlight and I"" were also deleted, and 10 additional songs added.  These last 2 also probably didn't chart, so they don't count either, right?The suggestion going forward is not to judge another reviewer, unless ye also be judged.  I don't worry about what ""charted""; I don't make a career of statistical analysis or chronological music forensics; I just care about the music I truly know.  And George, I know this stuff.  Bottom line; it's a great album in either new or or old format. This comes sooo close to perfect.  Two great songs are missing, and they would have provided a terrific perspective on the era of the 50's as well as being very apropos for today as well.  I'm referring, of course, to  &quot;Our Anniversary&quot; and &quot;I'll Get Along Somehow&quot;.  The  sincerity and affection, as well as musical playfulness, in  &quot;Anniversary&quot; gave it a unique niche in Doo-Wop history.  And the  sincere frustration and disappointment portrayed in &quot;I'll Get  Along&quot; was truly ahead of its time.  (Unless, of course, you consider  the raunchy predecessor to Rock; R&amp;B)  But consider the opening lines  and compare them to the music of the day, and you'll see what I mean.  &quot;I wanted love.  You promised love.  But all you gave was  conversation.  And now you're gone, but I'll get along somehow.&quot;  Talk  about cold shower time. Excellent recording of their hits. When I first heard the CD I was a little disappointed in the somewhat lack of fidelity, maybe I expected too much.  But after listening again I appreciated the clear recording sounding like they originally did. great songs.","R&B,Doo Wop,Oldies,Pop",known still night listen ill seeing aisle play reviewers ticked omission anniversary ill get along somehow yes one vinyl years ago labeled five satins sing greatest hits like hit regarded single release initially rpm rpm well enough sales air play juke box play get artist onto various billboard charts whether pop country r b strove achieve put map speak group charted hits three along b sides theyre perspective collector hit singles doesnt get better one time collectables right first still nite written group member lead singer known listen ill seeing aisle play reviewers ticked omission anniversary ill get along vinyl years labeled satins sing greatest greatest hits hits hit regarded single release initially rpm sales air air play play juke juke box box play artist billboard billboard charts charts pop pop country country achieve map speak group charted hits b sides sides perspective collector hit hit singles singles get better better time collectables right written group member lead lead singer singer
306,619,B0000008E0,"Terry Stafford's problem - if having just two national Pop hit singles to his credit can be considered a ""problem"" - were all related to timing, as he embarked upon his solo career just at the height of the British Invasion which, before it had run its course, had shoved aside all but the most notable North American artists.Born Terry LaVerne Stafford in Hollis, Oklahoma on November 22, 1941 and raised in Amarillo, Texas, he began his musical career as a member of the Eugene Nelson combo before moving to California in 1960 where he hooked up with, first, the Lively Ones, and then The Surfmen. None of these associations produced any national hit singles.His big break came in 1964 when he cut a cover of an Elvis LP offering, Suspicion, for the fledgling Crusader label, and saw it go to # 3 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in April b/w Judy (not here) on Crusader 101. A couple of months later his second release, I'll Touch A Star peaked at # 4 Adult Contemporary (AC)/# 25 Hot 100 b/w Playing With Fire on Crusader 105, but by this time he, like other North American artists such as Len Barry, Jewel Akens, Mel Carter. etc., were up against the likes of The Rolling Stones, Beatles, Herman's Hermits, The Byrds, The Dave Clark Five, and a horde of others from Britannia's shores.When nothing else worked he turned his hand to writing Country music, and in 1969 Buck Owens had a hit with Terry's Big In Vegas, taking it to # 5 Country and # 100 Hot 100. Four years later he himself re-emerged as a pure Country singer for Atlantic with a double-sided hit. The A-side, which he also wrote, was Amarillo By Morning and it made it to # 31 Country in February 1974 on Atlantic 4006 (George Strait would have an even bigger hit with it in 1983, taking it to # 4). The B-side was Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose which actually charted first, going to # 35 Country in November 1973 (Dawn, with Tony Orlando, had the pop hit).In May 1974, Captured topped out at # 24 Country on Atlantic 4015 b/w It Sure Is Bad To Love Her, and later that summer Stop If You Love Me reached # 69 Country b/w We've Grown Close on Atlantic 4026. Two more minor entries followed in 1977 and 1989 when a re-working of It Sure Is Bad To Love Her struggled to a # 94 Country in Match 1977 on Casono 113, and in February 1989, Lonestar Lonesome did only marginally better at # 85 Country on Player 134.His Country charters remain impossible to find in one compilation, although a few are in the 1007 release from Koch Records titled Hey Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose. Here I deduct 1 star for the omission of Judy. Seems to me when issuing a volume for an artist with but two Pop hits to this credit, some effort should be made to at least include all four sides of the two hits, even if that means adding a ""bonus"" track when reissuing material previously released.Terry, who passed away on March 17, 1996, appeared in the 1992 documentary Wild Wheels, directed by Harrod Blank. Covering the whackiest vehicles ever to appear on North American roads and highways, it is one of the funniest such films you will ever see. If you can find a copy. I rated this cd with four stars because of the one song on it &#34;Suspicion&#34;. I really liked it when it came out in 1959. The rest of the songs on this cd I did not know before I brought it but now enjoy some of the other songs on this cd.ThanksDan JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, WHEN I FIRST HEARD SUSPICION, I THOUGHT I WAS LISTENING TO ""ELVIS PRESLEY"". AND FOR IT TO BECOME A HIT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE SLAPPING ""ELVIS"" IN THE FACE. NOT ONLY DID ""TERRY"" COVER ""ELVIS"" SONG: ""SUSPICION"", WITH IT HITTING NUMBER 3 ON THE CHARTS, BEATING OUT ""ELVIS'S"" VERSION, BUT HE ALSO BROKE ""THE BEATLES"" HITS STREAK TOO. AS I LISTEN TO ""TERRY'S"" SINGING, I OFTEN WONDER DID HE NATURALLY SOUND LIKE ""ELVIS"" OR DID HE JUST IMITATE HIS VOICE! ""ELVIS"" AND ""THE BEATLES"" WERE THE TWO BIGGEST ENTERTAINERS IN THIS COUNTRY IN 1964. TO BEAT EITHER ONE WAS REALLY SOME STUNT. THE REST OF THE SELECTIONS ON THIS ALBUM ARE VERY GOOD ""ELVIS-SOUND-A-LIKES"" TOO. EVEN THOUGH I ENJOY ""SUSPICION"", MY FAVORITE SONG IS: ""I'LL TOUCH A STAR"".I FIRST HEARD IT WHEN I WAS AT A LOCAL McDONALD'S IN MY HOMETOWN, BACK IN THE 1980'S. THE DECOR WAS ALL RETRO, FROM THE FLOORS TO THE FURNISHINGS, IN LATE 50'S INTO THE 60'S STYLE, AND ONE OF THEIR FURNITURE FIXTURES WAS A JUKEBOX THAT THE CUSTOMERS COULD PLAY FOR FREE. ONE DAY WHILE I WAS THERE SOMEONE PLAYED ""I'LL TOUCH A STAR"". MY EARS LIT UP. I HAD TO KNOW WHAT THAT SONG WAS. AFTER I FOUND OUT, I SELECTED IT AGAIN, BUT I HAD TO WAIT MY TURN. THE JUKEBOX WAS SET UP TO PLAY ALL OF THE PRIOR SELECTIONS ALL THE WAY THROUGH FIRST BEFORE ANYTHING REPEATED. I TRIED BUT I WAS NEVER SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THE LOCAL ""OLDIES DJ'S"" TO PLAY IT FOR ME. BUT I NEVER FORGOT ""I'LL TOUCH A STAR"". THEN LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS TRYING TO FIND SOME WONDERFUL ""CLEAN"" SONGS FOR A YOUNG RELATIVE OF MINE, I PLAYED IT FOR HER AND SHE LIKED IT. SHE WANTED TO HEAR IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. THAT MADE ME VERY HAPPY. 'Suspicion' was the song that broke the Beatles' long string of #1 hits in Chicago. With all of the eager fans and business machinery behind Elvis' career, why would a totally unknown Elvis soundalike have a hit with this tune when Elvis didn't, (neither then or the few years before when E's version was released)?...Because it's -that- good. I bought his album in the early 60's. His copy of &quot;Suspicion&quot; is very close to that of Elvis. He does a great job on &quot;I'll Touch a Star&quot;. You like Elvis imitators, then get this CD. I have been looking for his songs and glad you had them. He's like Elvis  wow! where is he now? Terry Stafford - Born 22-10-1941 In Hollis OK Died 17-03-96 In Amarillo TXThirty one minutes of enjoyment on this CD!! Everyone seems to compare him with The King, I prefer to just ENJOY Terry's voice and songs, which bring back happy memories of the 1960's, an era which brought us terrific and talented artists who performed love songs that parents and children could appreciate together. Bring back the 60's!! Bring back Terry, Elvis, Roy, Buddy and all the many other GREAT Artists who could help cure some of our modern day screamers!!How's that for a stir?Nick (From Brisbane) Stafford's version is the one everyone remembers as an Elvis song.  If you play the two versions (I have) and compare them, there's really no comparision.  Stafford's is simply better.""Suspicion"" was orginally a demo done by Stafford. Crusader Records remastered and released it.Just because a singer releases a song first, doesn't make it his. Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman wrote the song and they and their publishers own it. They were a prolific team and wrote many songs that Elvis, the Drifters and others recorded. (for example, ""All Shook Up,"" ""Don't Be Cruel,"" and ""Great Balls of Fire"").If you listen closely, it's easy to tell it's not Elvis; notes aren't as round.  However, since Elvis' voice is decidedly better, I believe Stafford's version is better due to production. That's why, two years after Elvis released it, Stafford's version topped the charts when Elvis' version never made it out of the gate. After all, that's what recording engineers are for... improving a recording.You can't fault the artist. Back then, the record companies basically owned them and told them what to record, much like the movie studio system in Hollywood back in the day. It's not his fault his voice was similar to Elvis' and the record company exploited it instead of letting him develop his own style. It was probably to his career detriment; you can't be a star imitating someone else.Stafford later did a country chart topper, ""Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose"" for a different record label.","Country,Oldies,Pop,Rock",terry staffords problem two national pop hit singles credit considered problem related timing embarked upon solo career height british invasion run course shoved aside notable north american artists born terry laverne stafford hollis oklahoma november raised amarillo texas began musical career member eugene nelson combo moving california hooked first lively ones surfmen none associations produced national hit singles big break came cut cover elvis lp offering suspicion fledgling crusader label saw go billboard pop hot april b w judy crusader couple months later second release ill touch star peaked adult contemporary ac hot b w playing fire crusader time like north american artists su terry staffords problem national pop hit hit singles singles credit considered problem related timing embarked solo career height british british invasion invasion run course shoved aside notable north american american artists born laverne oklahoma november raised texas began musical career member eugene nelson combo california hooked lively lively ones ones associations produced national hit hit singles singles big break break came cut cover lp offering suspicion crusader label saw billboard pop hot april crusader couple months later second release ill touch star peaked adult contemporary ac hot playing fire time north american american artists
307,620,B0000008EK,"If you are a child of the sixties, you will remember Baby Washington's rendition of &quot;The Bells&quot;.  This and &quot;Time&quot; were two of her best songs.  All of the songs on this cd will send you back to prom night in your mind. Get your aging baby boomer buddies together, break out a bottle of wine, and drift down memory lane with this cd. Those of us who were fortunate enough to grow up in urban America in the late-1950s and 1960s will no doubt remember Baby Washington's records as mainstays on the radio.  In NYC you could always count on WWRL to play her latest release.  This release is a reminder of how rich her voice was and the songs sound even better today on cd.  I still get chills listening to her wail on ""Only Those In Love.""If you're not famiiar with Baby Washington and need a good introduction then this is the cd for you.  She may not have made it as a crossover Pop artist but her place is solidified as one of the great R&B; female vocalists of all time. Product arrived in a timley manner, in good shape. While only looking for one song, this was a fairly good complation of her music. IAto whom it may concern,would like to thank you for having this site to listen to.....back in the day i remember going to the old howard in washington d c to see baby washington, etta james, ike and tina,and many more....i think these old blues will live on forever..any 10 year old kid knows who elvis was, and a lot of baby boomers children will know of these  old grate groups also...after the show we would all go next door to CECILIAS, AND ENJOY THE COMPANY WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUPS....a lot of the old ones are gone, but very few new groups of today can hold a candle to------pookie hudson, sonny till, lee andrews, five royals, five satins, five royals,jesters, and many more.....better cut this short and once again thank you so much........mikep.s.where where you and what were you doing in 1956when pookie hudson and the spaniels made thisCLOSE YOUR EYES----- Baby Washington (b. 1940 as Justine Washington in South Carolina)grew up in Harlem.  She had a series of modest rhythm and blues hits in the late 1950s and 1960s for some small recording companies. In the mid-1950s, she recorded as part of a girl group called the Hearts and then went on her own as a soloist.  Washington was a fixture in her day on the ""chitlin"" circuit and, at the age of 66, still performs frequently in clubs and in  oldies shows. She has appeared several times in the Washington D.C. area in recent years.Baby Washington never successfuly became a ""crossover"" artist and her recording career faded in the early 1970s. I was unfamiliar with her during the days of her prime in the 1960s and only discovered her some years ago through my interest in blues and old doo-wop.  Washington has a wailing, expressive, and soulful voice, and she never has received the recognition as a soul singer that she deserves.As with many singers, Washington was hampered by poor material.  But this CD consisting of 12 songs and most of her hits does indeed showcase her at her best.  Most of Washington's songs are slow or moderately paced. The occasional uptempo novelty number, such as ""Move on Drifter"" seems to me less successful. Washington is frequently backed by a group -- male or female -- and often accompanied by strings. Her voice is amplified by an echo on many tracks.  The songs are mostly about lost love and feelings of isolation and loneliness (""Nobody Cares"", ""Leave me Alone"").  Baby Washington also sings of the passage of time in her hit ""The Clock"" with its ""tick-tock"" phrase and in the far better song ""The Time"" which moves slowly and sadly over the simplest chords. Baby Washington wails: ""Though time has turned its back on me/ though time has no sympathy/ now the time has taken my love.""Washington's more popular songs include ""The Time"", ""The Clock"",""That's How Heartaches are Made"" and ""The Bells"".  They are all included on this CD.  But for me the best of Baby Washington lies in two songs that did not become as popular even as these: ""Handful of Memories"" and especially ""You Never Could be Mine"".  The latter song was among Baby Washington's earliest efforts.  It includes a rolling, sad opening theme, and it develops with a faster-paced secondary theme.  The highlight of the song is the break which features a jagged piano accompanied by a honking sax.  Baby Washington sings with abandon: ""Moving around with someone else/ is out of my line/ so if your going from one to another/ I'm going to put you down/ And then I'll change like the weather/ change from you -- you to another/ And you'll be the one left alone crying/ Hey, Crying!/ Because you never could be mine.""A great deal of rhythm and blues beyond the star names remains to be discovered by those who love this American music.  This CD includes the legacy of Baby Washington, a pioneering soul singer who deserves to be remembered.Robin Friedman It boggles me why this R&B singer never made the mainstream.  She was most famous in the chitlin circut. Growin up in the 60's i heard a lot of her records as a child.  ""The Bells"", ""Nobody Cares"", ""That's How Heartaches Are Made"", ""Leave Me Alone"" and more on this will make you appreciate true R&B.  ""The Tears"" is not on this one.

310,624,B0000008GK,"Six years before the South Bend, Indiana white rock band calling themselves The Riviereas hit the charts with California Sun early in 1964 - one of the rare U.S. bands to get that high in the midst of the opening phases of the British Invasion - there existed another black Doo-Wop quartet from Englewood, New Jersey who managed to get three songs into the lower regions of the Billboard Pop Hot 100 in 1959/60 - just when Doo-Wop was fading out. Lead Homer Dunn (who had earlier been with a ,local group called The Bob-O-Links), bass Charles Allen, tenor Ronald Cook and baritone Andrew Jones had first formed up in sometime in 1954/55 as The Four Arts, sometimes being billed as The Four Artists, at gigs around the state. In 1956 they changed their name to the El Rivieras and eventually landed with a manager with the great name of William Fix - then managing The Ames brothers - who got them a 1958 audition at Coed Records, located in the famous Brill Building in New York City and owned by George Paxton and Marvin Cane.After Paxton convinced them to drop the ""El"" from their name, they went into the studio to record the 1950 Ray Anthony hit, Count Every Star which, paired with True Love Is Hard To Find, managed to get as high as # 73 Hot 100 in September 1958 on Coed 503. For their follow-up they reached back to 1939 and the Glenn Miller smash Moonlight Serenade, and this time just missed the Top 40, settling for a # 47 in February/March 1959 on Coed 508 b/w Neither Rain Nor Snow. A month later they failed with Our Love/Midnight Flyer (Coed 513), some pressings of which had a re-issue of True Love Is Hard To Find as the flip, before taking Since I Made You Cry to # 93 Hot 100 in January 1960 on Coed 522 b/w The 11th Hour Melody. And that would be it thanks to the rapidly-changing music scene and the emergence of groups like the new Drifters with lead Ben E. King, many of them accompanied by big string and/or horn arrangements. So otherwise old-school Doo-Wo treatments of things like Glenn Miller's  Moonlight Cocktails b/w The Blessing Of Love on Coed 529, My Friend/Great Big Eyes on Coed 538, and Easy To Remember/Stay In My Heart on Coed 542 in 1960 and, in 1961, El Dorado/Refrigerator on Coed 551 went nowhere. In 1964, whie the new Rivieras were scoring with California Sun, Coed re-released Moonlight Cocktail/Midnight Flyer (Coed 592) to no avail. By 1965 not only the group but the label were history.They never did cut an album but in the 1970s, when Post Records took over the Coed catalogue, they released an LP titled ""The Rivieras Sing"" (Post-2000) containing Moonlight Cocktails, The Eleventh Hour Melody, Count Every Star, Easy To Remember, Midnight Flyer, Moonlight Serenade, Our Love, Stay In My Heart, The Blessing Of Love, True Love Is Hard To Find, Neither Rain Nor Snow, and Serenade In Blue. Unfortunately, anyone who was a fan of the group in their day and who gobbled up a copy were soon disillusioned to find it was released in rechanneled stereo, which made them sound like they were singing down a drain-pipe.It wasn't until Collectables got access to the original session tapes in the early 1990s that we finally got a decent-sounding compilation. And here, with very good sound reproduction and informative liner notes written by Frank V. Aita and Donn Fileti, you get all sides to their Coed singles.This is still THE definitive Rivieras compilation. I play the music of the Riveras in my car and I enjoy riding and singing with the great love songs of the Riveras and nice group hamony.  The songs all bring back sweet memories when I was small and my mother played them.  My favorite is ""Neither Rain nor Snow"" great song. It is fantastic.  The Rivieras have such a mellow sound.  It brought back many memories of the fifties and sixties! I stumbled on this group and I love them. Very mellow with excellent voices. I never heard them on the radio so after listening to the samples I ordered the cd. If you like oldies then take a chance on this one. Not to be confused with the Indiana group of the same name that gave us the rockin' ""California Sun"", the Rivieras were a Northern New Jersey R & B quartet with a very distinctive sound.  Lead singer Homer Dunn reminds you quite a bit of Johnny Mathis.  The group produced a total of 8 singles for the Coed label during their brief three year run.  All of these tunes, as well as the flips, are included in this impressive collection.  The group covered a number of standards including ""Count Every Star"", ""It's Easy To Remember"", ""11th Hour Melody"", ""Moonlight Seranade"" and the title cut of this collection ""Moonlight Cocktails.""  I also found most of their ""B"" sides to be every bit as enjoyable.  My personal favorite is their rendition of ""Count Every Star"" which I feel is the finest version of this tune ever recorded.  When I began to explore the doo wop genre some 20 or more years ago, The Rivieras quickly became one of my favorites.  Unfortunately, the Rivieras disbanded when their record label folded in 1961. But if you love groups like the Platters you will love the Rivieras. From my era, this is ths best doo-woop group. The harmony is unbelieveable. If you like this music, you will love this. It arrived in perfect condition. And on time.","R&B,Doo Wop,Oldies,Pop,Soul",six years south bend indiana white rock band calling riviereas hit charts california sun early one rare u bands get high midst opening phases british invasion existed another black doo wop quartet englewood new jersey managed get three lower regions billboard pop hot doo wop fading lead homer dunn earlier local group called bob links bass charles allen tenor ronald cook baritone andrew jones first formed sometime four arts sometimes billed four artists gigs around state changed name el rivieras eventually landed manager great name william fix managing ames brothers got audition coed records located famous brill building new york city owned george paxton marvin cane paxton convinced six years south bend white white rock rock rock band band calling hit hit charts charts california sun early rare bands get high high midst opening phases british invasion existed black doo doo wop wop quartet new new jersey jersey managed lower regions billboard pop hot doo doo wop wop fading lead homer dunn earlier local local group group group called called bob links bass tenor ronald cook baritone jones formed arts billed artists gigs state state changed changed eventually landed manager great fix managing ames ames brothers brothers got audition coed coed records records located famous brill brill building building new new york new york city york city city george paxton cane convinced

Right up there with those is ""It's Been a Long Time"". Minor hits? Then there is""Keep on doin it"" that had everyone dancing back in the day.I haven't even gotten to the rest of the up tempo jams. I'll put it to ya this way folks, listen to ""I can understabd it"" and tell me how these were minor hits.That song  sounds like Bobby Womack was lending his vocal talents to that groove.

313,631,B0000008IZ,"This is not a review, per se.I'm apprehensive about buying a product when the producer doesn't show serious interest.  ""Collectable?""  Really?  If the producer can't spell ""collectible"" properly, it doesn't give me confidence about the care they put into the product.I came to Amazon today specifically to look for a Gloria Lynne disc to buy.  It's not going to be one that this outfit puts out, that's for sure. The recordings on this CD sound better than they did on the radio where I first heard them.  I gave mine to my sister and am purchasing another for myself.  The music is still fresh.  I absolutely love it!!  The ballads are smooth and mellow and make you feel good while you're listening.  If anyone is on the fence about buying this CD, don't be.If you have never heard of Gloria Lynn and you like easy listening music, you will never regret purchasing this CD.  If you have any relatives who grew up during the 50s and 60s and you want to give them something special, buy this one.  They will love you for it. I had no intention of reviewing this particular album/CD by Gloria Lynne. I had included it on one of my 'Listmania' compilations as a classic buy (grab it while you can!) and then read the totally negative review from Robert Hanks.Please...trust me...this Gloria Lynne album by a jazz artist of UNQUESTIONABLE credentials, is a masterpiece. Period. Nothin' more to be said.....but, OK, I'll say more.First of all, COLLECTABLE CD's are a god-send, helping us to preserve the Best of the Best from past musical history. They do excellent work, very professional, totally First Class. If Bobby Hanks ended up with a 'scratchy CD' he must have run his nails over it when he tore it out of the box &amp; into the player!And as for Gloria Lynne's interpretations of some classic ballads, well, just grab a little Tia Maria, curl up in front of a fireplace, and listen to this sultry songstress deliver...Full Force...&quot;I Wish You Love,&quot; &quot;The Folks Who Live On The Hill,&quot; &quot;I'm Glad There Is You,&quot; &quot;I Should Care,&quot; &quot;Try A Little Tenderness&quot;....I could name each &amp; every song on the CD, but you get the idea. They are all Perfect. They are all Glamorous, Glorious Gloria at her Grandest....and it doesn't get better than that! In Britain, ""I Wish You Love"" is perhaps mostly associated with legendary belter Shirley Bassey, but it was Gloria's version that made it a standard. The name Gloria Lynne may not sound terrible familiar to a lot of people outside the US, but in her hey day she was a tour de force, tackling everything from the blues to traditional pop music. Originally a gospel singer, Gloria's voice was full-bodied, but gentle at the same time. Her only big hit and Top 40 entry is of course ""I Wish You Love"", which peaked at number #28 in 1963. Like many incredibly talented African American women (namely Nancy Wilson and Carmen McRae), she struggled to break into the Billboard Hot 100, only managing to break through with a handful of songs: ""Tower of Strength"" (#100), ""Be Anything"" (#88), ""Don't Take Your Love from Me"" (#76) and of course ""I'm Glad There Is You"". That being said, Gloria was an incredibly talented singer, who was often overlooked.Highlights: ""I Wish You Love"", ""The Folks Who Live on the Hill"", ""Serenade in Blue"" and ""I Should Care"". This is some of Gloria Lynne's absolutely best work very poorly recorded on the Collectable label out of Pennsylvania.  BEWARE!  If it were not for Amazon's policy for not accepting return CD's opened, I would have  delivered it to them by hand.  This is a tragedy.  The company even  recorded some of these great songs off a scratchy LP, with no filtering  whatsoever.

315,643,B0000008S6,"Bobby Freeman really rocks. The rockers were great but the surprise for me was  his beautiful voice on the ballads, Wow, Jackie Wilson and Johnny Ace territory.  Bobby Freeman should get a little more acclaim for his great contribution to rock n roll. Also Sly Stones production on a few songs is an interesting look into Sly's early days. Bobby Freeman's self-penned Do You Want To Dance (sometimes shown as Do You Wanna Dance) got many teenagers doing ""the twist"" long before Hank Ballard, and then Chubby Checker, introduced it officially with their hit records in 1959 and 1960.When, in June of 1958, his first big hit (b/w Big Fat Woman) went to # 5 Billboard Hot 100 and # 2 R&B;, little did he realize that it would be resurrected several times over the next two decades (Del Shannon - # 43 Hot 100 in 1964; The Beach Boys - # 12 Hot 100 in 1965; The Mamas & The Papas - # 76 Hot 100 in 1968; and Bette Midler - # 8 Adult Contemporary and # 17 Hot 100 in 1973).Born on June 13, 1940 in San Francisco, Freeman had actually started out in 1954 with a group known as The Romancers who cut several unsuccessful sides with the Dootone label. He also formed a West Coast group called The Vocaleers, but this was not the same group that had the 1953 hit Is It A Dream?Following his first big hit as a solo artist on the Josie label, he came right back in August 1958 with Betty Lou's Got A New Pair Of Shoes, taking it to # 20 R&B; and # 37 Hot 100 b/w Starlight.For his next release, which hit its peak around Christmas, he departed from the frantic rocker bits to offer the tender Need Your Love in which he hints at a Sam Cooke-like quality (# 29 R&B;/# 54 Hot 100), although the flipside, Shame On You Miss Johnson, was just as torrid as his initial releases.1959 proved to be a bit of a struggle, however, with only Mary Ann Thomas (# 90 Hot 100 in June b/w Love Me) and Ebb Tide (# 93 Hot 100 in December b/w Sinbad) doing anything. In 1960, the King label released (I Do The) Shimmy Shimmy which made it to # 37 Hot 100 that October b/w You Don't Understand Me, but not only are both sides omitted from this compilation, it is very difficult to find them anywhere. One final charted song for Josie came in 1961 when The Mess Around struggled to a # 89 Hot 100 in April b/w So Much To Do.After a 3-year absence from the charts, in 1964 he then hooked up with both Autumn Records and Sly Stone (of Sly & The Family Stone fame) who produced C'mon And Swim which peaked that August at # 5 Hot100/R&B; b/w Part 2 of the same song. Not bad considering the opposition (all the British groups, led by The Beatles, not to mention The Beach Boys and The Supremes).However that stiff opposition eventually proved to be too much and his next, and final, charter was S-W-I-M b/w That Little Old Heartbreaker Me, which topped out at # 56 Hot 100/R&B; in November 1964. By the late 1960s/early 1970s he had switched to the pure Soul sound for the Loma and  Double-Shot labels - but without any further chart success.While this album gives you all his hit singles but the one noted above, along with two flipsides, it is skimpy by today's standards with just 12 tracks, and could easily become a 5-star CD by expanding to 20 selections with the addition of (I Do The) Shimmy Shimmy, it's B-side, and the other missing flipsides. Before the Beatles arrived, there was a period during the early 1960s that many view as relatively barren from a rock music perspective.  I recall those years well, but there were still a lot of songs, especially on the Cameo-Parkway label, that were just fine if you could dance.  This was an era in which ""record hops"" were popular.  Teenagers would go to a gymnasium or fire hall and dance to tunes such as ""Mashed Potato Time"" by Dee Dee Sharp.  If you could dance (I certainly can't), it was a lot of fun.  And, if you couldn't dance, there were TV dance shows that were a joy to watch.  There's a pleasing aesthetic in observing people who have the coordination to move gracefully to the music.This CD has a few decent dance tunes, among them the Bobby Freeman hit, ""C'mon and Swim.""  There are a couple of nice youtube videos associated with this song.  One features 1959 Miss America, Mary Ann Mobley, in all of her adorable cuteness, dancing with some guy in a turban.  Another features five women (in dresses, not bikinis) dancing beautifully to this song (although the music track might not match the actual dance).  Their foot movements seem professional and it's a lot of fun to watch.  This was an era in which people danced to simple music such as that which is on this CD (the frug, the hully gully, the watusi, the mashed potatos, the jerk, the swim, the stroll, and so on are examples of the dances of that time period).  People wanted to have a good time.  And, that is what is on this CD.  It's never going to be John Coltrane or the Modern Jazz Quartet.  But, who cares?  For those who simply want to relax and enjoy the beat, this CD is a worthwhile investment in a time that has, unfortunately, passed.  The girls generally danced better than the boys.  (We wouldn't admit it, but they could jump rope and we couldn't).  If your musical tastes are undemanding, you might find that this CD will bring a smile to your face. Whenever I hear this rockin cat he reminds me of the great Buddy Holly. That same kind of tone and energy without the hiccups of course. This is a great cd and he should've been a bigger star and should be remembered a whole lot better on today's Oldies stations regardless of what music research or some consultant infactuates. Where is the &#34;orginal&#34; version of C'mon and Swim with the 'organ riff' bridge that make the marriage of the brass section and the organ riff so successful and such a classic. The version included in this CD is identical to the original without the organ riff.  Can anyone tell me which Bobby Freeman cd contains that version? By the way, C'mon and Swim Pt.2 would have made a nice addtion to this classic cd. Nonetheless, like any collector, this quest continues, till it's replaced by another urgent aquisition in the effort to complete the collection of the most powerful decade in music.","Blues Rock,Soul,Pop,R&B,Rock,Blues",bobby freeman really rocks rockers great surprise beautiful voice ballads wow jackie wilson johnny ace territory bobby freeman get little acclaim great contribution rock n roll also sly stones production interesting look slys early days bobby freemans self penned want dance sometimes shown wanna dance got many teenagers twist long hank ballard chubby checker introduced officially hit records june first big hit b w big fat woman went billboard hot r b little realize would resurrected several times next two decades del shannon hot beach boys hot mamas papas hot bette midler adult contemporary hot born june san francisco freeman actually started group known romancers cut several unsuccessful sides dootone la bobby bobby freeman freeman really rocks rockers great surprise beautiful voice ballads wow jackie jackie wilson johnny johnny ace ace territory bobby bobby freeman freeman acclaim great contribution rock rock n roll roll sly sly stones stones production interesting look early early days days bobby freemans freemans self penned want dance shown wan dance got teenagers twist long hank hank ballard ballard chubby chubby checker checker introduced officially hit hit records records june big hit hit big fat fat woman billboard hot hot r realize resurrected times decades hot beach beach boys boys hot hot mamas mamas mamas papas hot bette midler adult contemporary hot born june san san francisco francisco freeman actually started group known romancers cut unsuccessful sides
316,644,B0000008SF,"Little Anthony & The Imperials are Pop & Soul legends and seeing Little Anthony in concert makes one wonder why he was not a huge solo success as Anthony Gourdine possesses one of the greatest voices in the history of popular music and great songs (to name a few) like ""Tears On My Pillow"", ""I'm On The Outside (Looking In)"", ""Hurt So Bad"", ""Going Out Of My Head"", ""Better Use Your Head"", all bear this out as they are timeless classics that sound great to this day...a new 2007 release ""You'll Never Know"" show this legend in great form and check out the duet with Deniece Williams for a rare musical treat! Get both great collections for the finest in soul-satisfying music and anything by Little Anthony & The Imperials is a must have for any true music lover!!! When i viewed the album on the Amazon website, I was unable to determine the names of the songs on the album.  As it turns out, I like all of the songs, but one of my favorites was not included.  I was able to determine the names of the songs on the other CD I purchased, but not this one.  Amazon should have a link whereby the potential buyer can see the names of all of the songs on the CD. This is classic American Pop!  ""I think I'm going out of my Head"" stands out the most for me on this collection!  Still, I give the entire disc a ""Five star"" rating! the group started out singing  street corner, the sound was very good but lack that certain instruments quality, not just any instruments,strings, harps, you get the picture. WHEN THAT SOUND WAS EMPOYED, LITTLE ANTHONY AND  THE IMPERIALS WERE GREAT, THAT WHY THEIR SONGS HAVE WITHSTOOD THE TIME  TEST. Little Anthony and the Imperials were an R&B vocal group from Brooklyn.  They started their recording career with End Records, for which they had the silly, lightweight hits ""Tears on My Pillow"" and ""Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko-Bop"" (Little Anthony himself has said he hates these songs).  Then, after several years without any more hits, they signed with DCP Records and adopted a more mature sound.  They had five hits with DCP(the last five songs on this CD), the best of which is the sublime ""Goin' Out of My Head"".  This is a decent CD, but it focuses too much on the silly songs they recorded for End Records, most of which weren't even hits. I guess i'm kind of partial to groups from Brooklyn, maybe because I was born there too. This is the best compilation of hits by Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials I've heard. Nine out of the eighteen tracks are in true  stereo, have you ever heard &quot;Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko-Bop&quot; in  stereo, it's like you were there. It includes all their early material as  well as those beautiful Teddy Randazzo productions from the mid sixties,  although I would've perferred a stereo version of &quot;I'm On The Outside  Looking In&quot;, the mono version is just as beautiful. I've seen Little  Anthony perform many times and not so long ago, the man still got it. Rhino  records did a fantastic job with this release. You really have to have been living in the 50's to appreciate this music. Little Anthony and The Imperials had it going on... over and above most.Thier rich harmonies carried the music to levels barely reached by others.'Tears on My Pillow', 'Two People in The World', 'The Diary', 'Going Out of My Head', 'Hurt So Bad' and 'I'm On the Outside Looking In' are fantastic! Still carry the oomph that they did years ago.It was nice to have all these songs in one place and in a great package.All you Doo-Wop fans... buy it. You won't be sorry. This compilation of ""Little Anthony & The Imperials"" includes most of their very best hits. ""Take me Back"", my all time favorite hit of that wonderful group and their all time blockbuster classic ""Tears On My Pillow"" are absolutely fantastic, the vocals are just superb.Do not miss this great CD by who I choose to call ""the monarchs of doo wop"". Terrific CD with all the great Little Anthony & The Imperials songs plus many others that were not as familiar.  Great product and great value. This group was recently at my church. I was very moved by their songs. I love all the songs on this cd, especially Arise, My Love and Beautiful day. They have their own website if you are interested in buying more of the cd's including a christmas one. God Bless! The Best of Little Anthony & the Imperials has all of their hits and most of their charted songs, plus a few that did not chart.  And there are NO remakes.That's the good news.  The bad news is that some of the cuts are still distorted at times.  The engineering is as good as it can be, but the original master tapes are apparently to blame.  I guess we'll never know why pieces of some songs are over-modulated...whether the mics were  overpowered, if the equipment was cheap, or the original engineers simply recorded too ""Hot"".All that said, the newer songs sound cleaner than the older pieces.  ""Take me Back"" sounds pretty good, but ""Tears on My Pillow"" will always have some distortion.  As soon as Anthony sings ""You don't remember me"" ... I have to turn down the volume a tad.  To quote my brother's first word when he was a baby .. ""Hot-ta""! I first heard this album nearly half a century ago at my cousin's houseone christmas. I ran out & purchased it & have it on old antiquated album. I don't even remember if it is stereo.I never realized the title it would be listed as for sale is that long &involved. I always got information on the album when I searched for it, but I never got information on how to buy it. I am so happy that I can now buy it from Amazon.This album is a time capsule of music of the time. It drips of the time & culture from which it came.Little Anthony has most likely the best voice for this kind of music that there ever was. Tears On My Pillow is most likely the only classic song on the album, but it is only one of many great songs. Just simply the finest Little Anthony and the Imperials compilation I've yet heard.  I threw out my previous one when I found this one. How is the fact that this recording is NOT by Little Anthony & the Imperials, but by some white guys billing themselves as the 'Imperials',getting all this praise and favorable reviews directed in behalf of Little Anthony & the Imperials even though this release is NOT Little Anthony & the Imperials!?! when I think of How Manufactored Acts get Pimped on MTV&amp;I Hear this set I just shake my head in disbelief because this is the Real Deal.from start to finish you get Harmony,Soul,Timing&amp;Feeling words that aren't used to Describe these Boy Groups out now.this Set is On from start to finish. This solid music collection covers the essential songs by one of the best doo-wop groups of that era. Anthony Gourdine, the lead singer, was nicely complimented by the Imperials whose harmonies always had a unique street-corner sound, and their records were a staple at neighborhood parties in the late 1950s and early 60s. ""Tears On My Pillow"" and the wonderful B side, ""Two People In the World"", are regarded as classics of the early years of rock/roll music. The group had two separate careers, first with End records, then a second and more successful run with DCP in the mid 1960s. With DCP, the group's arrangements consisted of lush strings and sophisticated orchestral arrangements that departed from the old church-style piano format at End. The result was a string of hits for the Imperials, including two Top 10 songs. Recently,  I was watching one of T.J. Lubinsky's sensational &quot;American Soundtrack&quot; shows on PBS.  Much to my surprise the group that blew me away that evening was Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Watching that program caused me to pull out this CD for the first time in quite a while.  I had forgotten what a terrific vocalist Anthony Gourdine really was.  And his appearance on the PBS special made it clear that after more than 40 years in the business this guy has not lost it one bit.  This collection from Rhino offers up around a dozen tracks from the groups early days at George Goldner's End records.  Among the pick of this litter are the groups first major hit &quot;Tears On My Pillow&quot; from 1958 as well as an impassioned version of Neil Sedaka's &quot;The Diary&quot;. And though the song never made the charts,  many consider &quot;Two People In The World&quot;,  the flip side of &quot;Tears On My Pillow&quot; to be the groups best effort.  The group disbanded in 1962 and Little Anthony went off searching for the Holy Grail of a solo career.But it was not to be.  Little Anthony and the Imperials would reunite in 1964 and surface at Don Costa's DCP records.  Here the group would team up with producer Teddy Randazzo to make some of finest pop records of that period.  To this day,  &quot;Hurt So Bad&quot; is still one of my all-time favorite records.  Little Anthony also exhibits his considerable vocal prowess on several other hits from that period including &quot;Goin' Out Of My Head&quot;, &quot;I'm On The Outside (Looking In)&quot; as well as the haunting &quot;Take Me Back&quot;.  After listening to this CD I am confident that you will agree with me that there is not a bad song to be found. Extensive liner notes make this CD an even better buy.  Highly recommended. The CD was of high quality and contained the original songs that I liked. I have always loved the music from the Imperials, I bought this cd specifically for the song Holy and Acceptable. I had never heard it before this cd. The album We Are The Imperials predates my birth by 23-24 years (1958 or 1959-1982), but I do recognize where good music comes from: Litlte andthony and the Imperials represent good music.  We Are... is an album filled with different styles witin the doo-wop/early rock realm. I am sure some of the songs are covers, like ""Somewhere over The Rainbow"" and a few others, but regardless, each song is handled with craft and the utmost class.  Little Anthony Anthony Gourdine) has a great tenor/falsetto, and the Imperials provide perfect harmony.  The most racognizable song here is the perennial classic ""Tears On My Pillow,"" which is a staple in RnB and soul, a classic slow drag.  Another doo-wop winner is ""Two People in the World,"" which rings with innocence and true love as opposed to the relentlessly blatant sexual prowess of many RnB acts of today, and is a refreshing change.  ""Wishful Thinking"" also has that sweet innocence but with heartbreak lyrics about a relationship gone bad.  ""What Did I Do"" also has a similar vibe and tone.  I love the guitar licks on this one.  We also have the faster paced rock jams like ""Cha Cha Henry"" and ""Oh Yeah"" which are cool.  Little Anthony's lead on the latter is some pure poetry and is a fun jam to vibe to and will make your head not incessantly.  We Are The Imperials is a fun album to listen to, and represents a period of time when Doo Wop, Rock and Roll and early Soul and RnB were branching out, an exiting time of music I was not around to experience. There's been a lot of talk lately that Little Anthony and the IMPERIALS are under serious consideration for induction into the ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME. I say YES YES YES !! The IMPERIALS most DEFINITELY SHOULD be inducted into the ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME.In fact, they should have been among the FIRST groups inducted. They, along with THE MIRACLES and DELLS ,(and to a lesser extent, the IMPRESSIONS),were the only groups of the DOO WOP era of the 1950's to maintain consistant success well into the '60's and '70's. That alone should have gotten them inducted.Their songs have become recognized classics ,having been recorded by artists as diverse as SERGIO MENDEZ,LINDA RONSTADT, FRANK SINATRA,REBA MCENTIRE .and others.They could very well have been the very first ""ADULT CONTEMPORARY"" GROUP,establishing a new level of class and sophistication never before seen in R&b groups,while at the same time never abandoning their DOO WOP roots. The LETTERMEN,for one, seem to have re-recorded every song they ever made.Songs such as TEARS ON MY PILLOW,HURT SO BAD,I'M ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN,TWO PEOPLE IN THE WORLD,GOING OUT OF MY HEAD,SHIMMY SHIMMY KO KO BOP,{which was featured in the TOM HANKS hit movie ""BIG""},TAKE ME BACK,I'M ALRIGHT,BETTER USE YOUR HEAD,OUT OF SIGHT-OUT OF MIND,I MISS YOU SO,HURT,HELP ME FIND A WAY,and others have been recorded and re-recorded many times by others over the last 45 years. GOING OUT OF MY HEAD,for one, has had over 100 recorded versions, but none sounds as good as Little Anthony and The IMPERIALS'original version. They have also influnced an entire generation of artists , such as THE STYLISTICS, DELFONICS,BLUE MAGIC,MANHATTANS,CHI-LITES,and many more.In fact,the entire Philidelphia-based soft - soul movement of the 1970's,as exemplified by producers such as KENNY GAMBLE,LEON HUFF,THOM BELL,VAN MCCOY,and others,with it's emphasis on full symphonic orchestration and vocal harmony,can be traced directly back to the IMPERIALS'ground breaking early '60's recordings with TEDDY RANDAZZO and the late DON COSTA.Go back to the earliest days of rock and roll and they are there, with appearances on such shows as THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW, AMERICAN BANDSTAND,PERRY COMO'S KRAFT MUSIC HALL,ABC'S SHINDIG,NBC'S HULLABLOO,THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL,and the MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - all the way up to their show stopping performances on the 2002 & 2003 PBS MUSIC SPECIALS-the IMPERIALS-ANTHONY, ERNEST,CLARENCE,& SAMMY-most definitely SHOULD {along with the MIRACLES,who STILL haven't been inducted }-be inducted into the ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME ! one listen to this cd,and YOU'LL SEE WHY !! ....what can I say? You have now struck pure gold. Rhino Records always do their compilations corrrectomundo and these classic tunes of one of the greatest singing groups ever have been served well here. Stop reading and start buying, now! This is for true music lovers only! Little Anthony and the Imperials had a string of r'n'b style hits on the End label in the late 50's.  After several years absence from the charts, they resurfaced, and with the writing/producing talents of Teddy Randazzo, Anthony Gourdine and his Imperials created some of the most memorable, superbly crafted pop tunes of the rock era, several of which have become standards.  ""Goin' Out Of My Head"", ""Hurt So Bad"" and ""I Miss You So"" represent some of the most polished landmark tunes to come out of the mid-60's.This collection, though containing most of their 60's-era DCP, Veep and United Artists charted sides, does not include any of their End label sides and cannot therefore be considered a comprehensive ""best-of"" in that regard.  With plenty of room - as the disc runs a mere 32 minutes - a strange and inexplicable omission is the exclusion of one of their UA singles in favor of a short promo spot at the end of the disc.  Stinginess aside, this still represents an excellent gathering of LA&I;'s 60's classic recordings.Having been taken from the original mixdown masters and master session tapes, the sound quality is top-notch with all tracks except ""Take Me Back"" (the single version is used here) and the promo spot presented in stereo.  The stereo on ""I'm On The Outside Looking In"" however is a ""wide-mono"" mix and not the original wide, albeit unbalanced, lp stereo mix.  Liner notes are limited to track listings with production credits.  Minor criticisms aside, this mid-priced, no-bells-or-whistles compilation is the one of the best collections of LA&I;'s astounding pop tunes from their 60's run.","Oldies,Blues Rock,Soul,Pop,R&B,Doo Wop,Rock,Blues,Oldies & Retro",little anthony imperials pop soul legends seeing little anthony concert makes one wonder huge solo success anthony gourdine possesses one greatest voices history popular great name like tears pillow im outside looking hurt bad going head better use head bear timeless classics sound great day new release youll never know show legend great form check duet deniece williams rare musical treat get great collections finest soul satisfying anything little anthony imperials must true lover viewed amazon website unable determine names turns like one favorites included able determine names cd purchased th imperials pop pop soul soul legends seeing concert wonder huge solo success anthony gourdine possesses greatest voices history popular great tears pillow looking hurt bad head better head bear timeless timeless classics classics sound great great day day new release know show legend great form check duet deniece williams rare musical treat great collections soul satisfying imperials true lover viewed amazon website unable determine names turns favorites included able determine names cd purchased
317,645,B0000008SI,"This is exactly what I thought it would be. Along with other oldies that I have purchased via Amazon.com, I can now, mentally, go back to a time in my life that I loved. Flamingo Serenade, with it's melodic harmonies is the type of music needed to combat the 'spoken word' genre that now permiates our airwaves. Of course, being a late50's and 60's guy, I am somewhat prejudiced when it comes to my musical entertainment. At any rate, Flamingo Serenade is excellent. I wish I could be as enthusiastic about the Victory At Sea DVD I purchased. It was edited terribly. The script and music synchronization is of paramount importance in delivering that documentary. My copy was chopped and badly edited. The narrator, Alexander Scourby, has been dealt an injustice. Flamingo Serenade is THE classic r & b ballad album.  So-called Doo wop is an art form, like cubism or Frank Lloyd Wright houses.  Their songs have the wonderful high falsetto sound in the background, carried through masterfully by Terry ""Buzzy"" Johnson.  Terry is the only active member of the great 1950s Flamingo line-up still active.  Johnny Carter, who left the Flamingos to become lead singer for the Dells, passed away recently.  For the full history of the Flamingos, type in Marv Goldberg on your search engine. Also, I recommend a song on a different album, ""I'm Yours,"" which is ranked #3 in the world rankings of doo wop.  Michael DeArmey. Quality of the CD was very low.  Sound was far below origanal, sounds like it was a copy of a copy of a copy.  I do not think I would purchase another from this company. one song is original. the rest ? i don't know. has alot of the flamingos old songs but they just don't sound like the flamingos. I can remember, back in 1959, I was in the Air Force, stationed in Morocco. One day I received orders to clean the floor of the Air Base Airport. I asked the Desk Sergeant if he would play my 33rpm Vinyl record of &#34;Flamingo Serenade&#34;. He put it on the loadspeaker, and my cleanup detail became a treat! This particular album has all old song standards beautifully arranged and sung. Some things just come along to make you glad your alive. I believe there is only one original member of this great group still alive. So sad, but they have left a legacy that is timeless. I agree with the negative rating, this does not sound original at all, poorly done.  I will look for another; I hope I find something original. one the original great vocal groups.  the best of the croners and the mobile sound, there are no groups like anymore. very pleased to find this treasure trove from the Flamingos.  impossible to find other places.  This is actually my second purchase of the same item, one for the car and one for the house. thank you. Perhaps the best and most underappreciated of doo-wop groups delivers a classic set of songs that are filled with beautiful harmonies that were a hallmark of the Flamingos. Their big hit, ""I Only Have Eyes For You"", opens the CD program and every tune thereafter is given the special Flamingo treatment of sweet and silky lead vocals supported by mellow harmonies from the group. Flamingo standards such as ""Love Walked In"", ""Time Was"" and ""Goodnight Sweetheart"" are included but the group's interpretations of old favorites like ""I'm In the Mood For Love"", ""Where Or When"" and ""But Not For Me"" make this collection so much more than an R&B memory lane album and is treasured by everyone who remembers this wonderful group that never received the accolades they deserved.

320,648,B0000008TC,"Great album! My husband loves Old school blues and Scream'in Jay Hawkins is great old fashion blues. Disc was in great condition and Worth the buy. This is THE song, not the whitebread edition, but powerful, raw, bluesysinging at it's best.When Screamin' Jay sings ballads, he's got a powerfully good voice, not atiny one, but robust and rounded.This is the archetypical bluesy record!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't know where to begin with this album.  You could say so much about this guy.  For starters, Screamin' Jay was more like three men packed into one.  He was a prize fighter, a singer/songwriter and aspiring opera singer.  He was also campy, wonderfully eccentric and irresistably soulful.Most people know him for one of his greatest hits, ""I Put a Spell On You.""  This tune about obsessive love is really like no other song I have ever heard.  Screamin' Jay does it best, of course (though, it was remade by the wonderful Nina Simone, as well as other artists).  His nickname was, no doubt, a true indication of his style.  This man alternates wailing, crooning, and screaming with true singing talent.  He alternates feelings of torture with feelings of satisfaction (and, sometimes, it is hard to decide which emotion he is truly trying to convey--maybe both?).This album is a combination of Jay's original works (""I Put a Spell on You,"" ""Hong Kong,"" and ""Yellow Coat""), and old standards (""I Love Paris,"" ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" ""Ol' Man River,"" ""If You are But a Dream,"" and ""You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)"").  The combination of scatting, unusual interpretaion and hilarious ad-libbing is truly delivered in a way I have never heard before.  Jay definitely has the mojo and the juice to carry this wonderful album.  You just have to hear it to believe it. First of all, I would like to notice that it's the reissue of his first album ""at home with S.J.H."" (originally issued on Epic in 1958) with a different order in the titles and a different cover. Secondly, I think it's the album of reference of his long and heratic carreer. Personally, I was so blowed when I first heard his powerful voice able to sing blues, easy listening or rock. A true artist of music hall in a sense that he is a true character. Screaming Jay Hawkins &quot;I Put A Spell On You&quot; is one of the definitive albums of the bizarre 1960's.  This music is as unique as Frank Zappa, in it's own right.  The strange delivery of Screaming Jay works  wonders with the orchestral sound of the band on songs like Orange Color  Sky, and his jibberish yip yapping on Hong Kong are not only hysterical,  but funky as well.  The way he could include Swing Low Sweet Chariot on  this album is beyond anyone's belief.  This is one of the great albums of  all time- either you will love it or hate it, but you will by no means ever  forget it. I bought this because I heard the title track on radio and was astounded by it. I still am. I love it. The rest of the album is hideous. but I got what I bought it for.

321,649,B0000008XI,"OK, the original technology used to record these was not up to modern standards, so this is as good as it gets.And because the original resolution was low, you get a lot of music on one disk.They are reasonably crisp with no conversion artifacts.It's as good as the original recordings permit. Josh White can rip your heart out with his blues, especially on songs like &quot;One Meat Ball&quot; (my personal favorite) and &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (an even stronger version than Billie Holliday's).  He has an intensity and style all his own, and I found this album to be a good cross-section of his work.

322,652,B0000008YQ,"In response to the question ""who were the best black singing groups during the mid to late 50s"" - the beginning of the Rock Era - and the first names to pop up will invariably be The Platters, the Drifters, Coasters, Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers and Hank Ballard & The Midnighters. Then, after a bit of thinking, someone will mention The Flamingos, Moonglows, Olympics, Cadillacs and Little Anthony & The Imperials. Then it'll be a bit longer before the names The Five Satins, The Cadets [or Jacks as they were also known], and The Rays are offered.Great groups all, but somebody had to pave the way, and in the early part of the 1950s the pathfinders were groups like The Clovers, Dominoes, Five Keys, Ravens, Spiders, Four Tunes, Charms, Larks and early incarnations of the later successes such as The Drifters, led by the incomparable Clyde McPhatter, The Royals [who became The Midnighters, and The Robins who would transform into The Coasters.Also in this elite group were The '5' Royales, from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and consisting of cousins Lowman and Clarence Pauling [replaced part way through their career by Obadiah Carter], Windsor King, and brothers Eugene and John Tanner. They might not have been what you could call fabulously successful, but in 1953/54 they had five huge R&B; hits, backed by Charlie ""Little Jazz"" Ferguson & His Orchestra. Baby Don't Do It and Help Me Somebody - two #1s - spent a combined 31 weeks on the charts in 1953 [the flip of the latter, Crazy, Crazy, Crazy, also went to # 5 R&B;]. Later that that year Too Much Lovin' [Much Too Much] went # 4 R&B; and in 1954, when their tenure with Apollo ended, they took I Do to # 6 R&B.;All are on this fine set, as are the other B-sides - Take All Of Me, the wonderfully wicked Laundromat Blues [my baby's got the best machine ... the best washin' machine in town ... just relax and take it easy while the machine goes round and round ..."" and Good Things which, in my opinion, should have charted as well - it's that good.With their new label, King, they found success a little harder to come by, taking almost three years to find another charter before scoring with Tears Of Joy (# 9 R&B;) and Think (# 9 R&B; and # 66 pop) in 1957. Unfortunately, this being a compilation of their stint with Apollo these two are not included. But even so the CD is a must for anyone interested in the music of one of the most influential singing groups of that era. In addition to fine sound quality, there are two pages of liner notes written by Mark Marymont. Thank you for your thoughtful review, Richard. I just listened to samples of this talented group and about fell off my chair. I purchased it straight away! These songs came out around the time I was born. I'm a hunter of old NYC recording studios. These gentlemen recorded at the old Beltone Studios on W. 31st St. in the Big Apple just up the street from where I once lived. It's fun to go 'round the city and visit the old studio haunts where the Greats recorded. Everyone seems to be recording at home these days - chemistry and spontaneity are lacking from exploiting multi-track recorrding capabilities that are afforded those with home DAW's, but not during these sessions! This is the real deal. These live performances are right in your face, up close and personal with all the intensity that went into the performances. They were forever captured over fifty years ago before the term R&B was coined for us to be able to kick off and chill after a hard day. Wow! Great sound, great tunes, great arrangements and great performances. In my opinion, music just isn't happening these days like it was back then. The spirit is missing. Listening to this makes my hair stand on end; it's that GREAT!!! I just had to have it in my collection. They just don't cut tracks and make records like this anymore. If this goes out of print, I'll be happy to have grabbed one for myself! This is really cool, man. These cats were light years ahead of our time! While not the best album by the group, you get a good selection of their music, that is all great! There is not much I can add to the avid collector from Ontario's informed review except to say if you are at all interested in the wonderful music from this era this is a must-have CD. After fifty-five years not hearing the recordings I can still sing the lyrics to Good Things and Laundramat Blues. They are gems.Nice to see The Five Royales being recognized as the fine group they were. There is not a single track on this alblum that I don't at least like, if not absolutely love. This alblum contains the song ""laundromat blues"", which was one of the many songs  blacklisted for radio play back then because it was thought too racy for the day. Heck, It's kind of racy by today's standards as well! The rest of the songs on this cd are very different however. They are soulful ballads full of pure soul and emotion. ""Help me Somebody"" is a prime example of this. I can picture the lead singer with a death-grip on the mic, belting out this wondeful song. This alblum is pure vocal R&B soul.","Oldies,R&B,Pop,Jump Blues,Doo Wop,Rock,Classic R&B,Blues,Oldies & Retro",response question best black singing groups mid late beginning rock era first names pop invariably platters drifters coasters frankie lymon teenagers hank ballard midnighters bit thinking someone mention flamingos moonglows olympics cadillacs little anthony imperials itll bit longer names five satins cadets jacks also known rays offered great groups somebody pave way early part pathfinders groups like clovers dominoes five keys ravens spiders four tunes charms larks early incarnations later successes drifters led incomparable clyde mcphatter royals became midnighters robins would transform coasters also elite group royales winston salem north carolina consisting cou response question best black singing groups mid late beginning rock era first names names pop invariably platters drifters coasters frankie lymon lymon teenagers hank hank ballard ballard midnighters bit thinking mention flamingos moonglows olympics imperials bit longer names satins cadets jacks known rays offered great groups somebody pave way early pathfinders groups clovers dominoes keys ravens spiders tunes charms larks early incarnations later successes drifters led incomparable clyde mcphatter royals midnighters robins transform coasters elite elite group group royales winston winston salem north carolina
323,654,B0000008Z4,"When Sue Thompson hit it big on the Hickory label in 1961 with Sad Movies (Make Me Cry)- # 1 on the new Adult Contemporary (AC) charts and # 5 Billboard Hot 100 in October b/w Nine Little Teardrops - she was no spring chicken. In fact, born Eva Sue McKee on July 19, 1926, she got her start in music with the Dude Martin western swing band in 1949, operating in the San Francisco area, and in that period Martin became her second husband.A recording contract with Mercury then produced some local hits like Tadpole, You Belong To Me, and If You Want Some Lovin'. In 1953 Sue then dumped Martin and married a newcomer to the band, Hank Penny, and in 1955 she and her new husband recorded some singles for the Decca label, again without any national chart success. But a fortuitous contract with Hickory and a linking up with some John D. Loudermilk songs (Sad Movies being one of them) changed everything.Following her initial hit, she had a banner year in 1962 with Norman (# 3 Hot 100 in February b/w Mever Love Again); Two Of A Kind - # 8 AC/# 42 Hot 100 in April b/w It Has To Be); Have A Good Time (# 9 AC/# 31 Hot 100 in August b/w If The Boy Only Knew (which made the Hot 100 ""bubble under"" charts at # 112); and James (Hold The Ladder Steady) - # 17 Hot 100 in November and another Loudermilk tune b/w My Hero.In 1963, Willie Can struggled to a # 78 Hot 100 in February b/w Too Much In Love and, after being blanked in 1964 (thanks in no small part to the arrival of The Beatles and a host others from the U.K.), she came back the next year with tet another Loudermilk offering, Paper Tiger, a # 23 Hot 100 in March b/w Mama, Don't Cry At My Wedding. Still sounding like a 14-year-old in spite of the fact she was pushing 40.But that was it insofar as the Billboard Pop charts were concerned. However, following a 6-year absence from the charts, she resurfaced in 1971, still with Hickory and. over the new two years, went back to her Country roots by cutting a number of sides in a duet with Country great Don Gibson, producing four hit singles: The Two Of Us Together (# 50 in 1971); Did You Ever Think? (# 71 in 1972); I Think They Call It Love (# 37  in 1972), and Candy And Roses (# 72 in 1971).From late 1972 to 1976 Sue added 8 more Country charters, the best of which were Good Old Fashioned Country Love (# 31 in 1974), and Oh, How Love Changes (# 36 in 1975), and saw the funny Big Mabel Murphy hit # 40 on the Adult Contemporary charts as well as # 50 Country in October 1975. Still sounding like she was 14.Although these Country sides are not on this CD, this is still a great compilation, giving you all seven of her early Pop hits and all the flipsides except the last two. Sue Thompson was one of the finest singers who produced many very popular songs.  Very nice. I had listened to a couple of Sue Thompson's songs as a teenager but had forgotten about her. Then a friend of mine was playing some of her songs while visiting me and they brought back some memories. I couldn't wait to get online and order this CD. I really enjoy it. Even though she was nominally a &quot;country&quot; artist, the squeeky-voiced Sue Thompson was really much more in a teen pop and girl group singer, whose work in the early 1960s skirted the edges of rock'n'roll and pop, very much modeled after Brenda Lee and her highly successful crossover formula.  For fans of the style, Thompson's early singles offer a swell &quot;new&quot; set of teenpop tunes outside the usual Brill Building standards by Carole King and her pals.  John D. Loudermilk wrote most of these tunes, which were recorded for the independent Hickory label, and they are actually pretty fun to listen to. This 18-song CD is more generously programmed than other Thompson best-ofs, and sticks more strictly to her early work. It's not very country, but it is a lot of fun! THIS GAL RELEASED SOME GREAT SONGS. SHE FELL ON THE SAME STYLE AS WANDA JACKSON, JO ANN CAMPBELL,ETC. SHE FELL ON THE POP MUSIC CHARTS WITH SONGS LIKE ""NORMAN"", ""JAMES, HOLD THE LADDER STEADY"", ""PAPER TIGER"" AND ""SAD MOVIES MAKE ME CRY"" WHICH ARE FINALLY OURS, THANKS TO THIS C.D.!!! YOU'LL  LOVE SUE THOMPSON'S STYLE AND THIS C.D. BRINGS BACK SOME GREAT TUNES AND MEMORIES.SUE THOMPSON FALLS IN THE 60'S GIRLS CATEGORY.DON'T MISS THIS LONG AWAITED GEM!! I wanted a Sue Thompson music CD with the songs: Sad Movies, Paper Tiger, Have A Good Time, Two Of A Kind, and If A Boy Only Knew. It's a pleasure to listen to her girlish voice. IT WAS A GREAT CD! SO HAPPY I AM ABLE TO RETURN TO  THOSE MEMORIES WHEN EVER I WANT NOW. Sue Thompson is well remembered for her song ""Norman""......one can see videos of her performing this song on various sources of videos out there on the internet. While that song is great and a trademark of hers, she exhibits her versatility on the other cuts on this CD that are rarely heard on stations playing her songs.

324,655,B0000008Z7,"A very good &#34;best of&#34; about the Buddy Johnson's Orchestra with the singer Ella Johnson (Buddy's daughter). The &#34;One nighted king&#34; as he was called, is right between Jazz and Rock and Roll. This is dance music of the fifties by a very good orchestra. I was about 3 or 4 when I first heard these songs.  The 1950's juke-boxes in black neighbors rocked with the sound of Buddy And Ella Johnson, a brother and sister duo, whom I had the pleasure of seeing at the Apollo theater as a kid.  Their style is unmarked and if you listen to Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell  you hear some of that same magic that these two had.Had they of lived today I'm sure you would've seen them on television, movies, and the internet, but at that time blacks, no matter how talented were limited to race stations, far down the dial, but here they are in this magnificent CD that brings back memories. I have been looking for &quot;I'M JUST YOUR FOOL&quot; for FORTY YEARS, I never realized the whole CD would be so GREAT. They don't make music like this anymore. Thank you Amazon for having my kind of music. I have bought  other great CD'S from you and will continue to do so. If you have Walk 'Em....well, you have to decide. Walk 'Em's elements of groove, musicality and lowest-common denominator appeal are held in an almost-Mozartian balance. This combined with the excellent sound makes that CD a must. It made me want more - and...this CD is more - and less. Nothing here is on the level of such tracks as The Stuff You Gotta Watch or Root Man Blues. It's good enough. But rarely hellified.

326,658,B0000008ZD,"Collectables once again comes up with a 20-track CD for a group that had less than ten hit singles - and leaves off two of those hits. While I will never understand their rationale, I have to admit that this one is to be counted among their best offerings. The sound is flawless and the liner notes informative.Danny Rapp [lead], David White [first tenor], Frank Maffei [second tenor], and Joe Terranova [baritone] first got together while in high school in Philadelphia where they called themselves The Juvenairs. In 1957 they had their first release under their new name for the small Singular label, but when ABC-Paramount picked it up it was changed from Do The Bop to At The Hop. With Sometime (When I'm Alone) as the B-side, and with the backing of the Artie Singer orchestra, it tore up both the R&B; and Billboard Pop Top 100 charts, reaching # 1 on both early in 1958 and remained there for seven weeks [Top 100] and five weeks [R&B;].Like many others in that era who literally exploded onto the charts, any follow-up singles were bound to suffer by comparison. In their case, however, the similar-sounding Rock And Roll Is Here To Stay topped out at a very respectable # 16 R&B;/# 19 Top 100 in April 1958 b/w Schoolboy Romance, while their third release, Dottie, reached # 39 Top 100 that July b/w In The Meantime, still backed by Singer's orchestra.But when nothing else clicked for the rest of that year [they did appear in the film Let's Rock], and all of 1959, they were dropped by ABC-Paramount. Now with Swan Records in 1960, they climbed aboard the twist craze with Twistin' U.S.A. which reached # 27 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in October b/w A Thousand Miles Away. The following spring Pony Express made it to # 60 Hot 100 b/w Daydreamer [not here], and later that year they attempted to re-capture the old magic with Back To The Hop. Few were buying, however, and it peaked at # 80 Hot 100 in September 1961 b/w The Charleston Fish [also not here].They were still with Swan in 1962 when they hooked up with Freddy ""Boom Boom"" Cannon on Twistin' All Night Long, but even that combination failed to get them any higher than # 68 Hot 100 in January b/w Some Kind Of Nut [not included]. Also missing here is their last Swan hit which came in April 1962 when Doin' The Continental Walk struggled to # 93 Hot 100 b/w Do The Mashed Potatoes. On all Swan hits the backing band was Frank Slay & His Orchestra.Their final kick at the can, a desperate grasp at another craze, came in 1963 for the Guyden label when Oo-La-La Limbo just made the Hot 100 at # 99 b/w Now And Then. Neither is included here.As mentioned by another reviewer Rapp left us in April 1983 by committing suicide, while White moved on to Decca Records and The Spokesmen with whom, in 1965, he had a # 36 Hot 100 with The Dawn Of Correction, sort of an answer song to Barry McGuire's crepe-hanging Eve Of Destruction.Should they be considered for the R&R; Hall of Fame as suggested elsewhere? Well, based upon their commercial success alone, they were miles ahead of both Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran - and both of them have been inducted. And neither ever came close to the rousing success of At The Hop which certainly has to be considered among the all-time R&R; anthems. This Golden Classic Edition of Danny and the Juniors cd is well recorded. The lyrics are dated, of course, but the instrumentals are well worth the listening. For those who like Doo Wop music, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this cd. The groups bread and butter hits, At The Hop and R&R is Here to Stay, will bring back many good/old memories for those who remember listening to them on their transistor radio. Danny And The Juniors were a great vocal group from Philadelphia, with Danny Rapp as lead vocalist, David White as first tenor, Frank Maffel as second tenor and Joe Terry as baritone.  In December of 1957, the group got their first big break by performing on American Bandstand.  By early 1958, their classic song &quot;At The Hop&quot; went all the way to number 1.  &quot;Rock And Roll Is Here To Stay,&quot; a 50's anthem that was the group's follow-up hit single, was written by group member David White.  The group were as skillful at slow ballads, like &quot;Sometimes (When I'm Alone)&quot; and &quot;School Boy Romance,&quot; as they were with rockers, like &quot;Dottie&quot; and &quot;Twistin' USA.&quot;  Like most 50's vocals groups, they tried to repeat their success with similar sounding songs.  &quot;Back To The Hop&quot; is a sequel to &quot;At The Hop,&quot; while the melody of &quot;Playing Hard To Get&quot; is a variation of &quot;Rock And Roll Is Here To Stay.&quot;  &quot;Twistin' All Night Long&quot; features the group mentioning and then imitating Chubby Checker, Connie Francis, Fats Domino and Johnny Mathis, only to be joined by the real Freddy Cannon at the end!  Danny Rapp is no longer with us, and the Juniors are all Seniors now.  On the strength of their great songs included in this collection, Danny And The Juniors truly deserve to be in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame.","R&B,Doo Wop,Oldies,Pop,Rock",collectables comes cd group less ten hit singles leaves two hits never understand rationale admit one counted among best offerings sound flawless liner notes informative danny rapp lead david white first tenor frank maffei second tenor joe terranova baritone first got together high school philadelphia called juvenairs first release new name small singular label abc paramount picked changed bop hop sometime im alone b side backing artie singer orchestra tore r b billboard pop top charts reaching early remained seven weeks top five weeks r b like many others era literally exploded onto charts follow singles bound suffer b collectables comes cd group hit hit singles singles leaves hits understand rationale admit counted best offerings sound flawless liner liner notes notes informative danny rapp rapp lead david white white tenor frank second tenor joe terranova baritone got high high school school philadelphia called release new singular label abc paramount picked changed bop hop b side side artie singer singer orchestra tore billboard pop pop top charts reaching early remained weeks weeks era literally exploded charts follow singles bound suffer
327,659,B0000008ZE,"Cd came just as advertised and arrived quickly.  We were having a mother/ daughter event which included a skit and several if the songs were right on target. Always a pleasant listen when Mike Douglas sings ballads.  This cd contains some sentimental songs which are sure to touch your heart, I'm 63 now and a grandmother.  When Mike Douglas had his tv talk/variety show, he had a big selling record, ""The Men In My Little Girl's Life"".  This record tells a story from the beginning of his little girl's introduction to boys and continues on through the teenage years, marriage and motherhood.  Every time I hear that song, I cry because it makes me think of my dad.  I have tried for years to find this song to pass along to my son (whose wife gave birth to a darling little baby girl, who is now 6).  This year I purchased the CD for my son's birthday (thanks to Amazon).  I know he has the same love for his little girl now that my dad had all those years for me.  My son will continue to have these strong, loving feelings until she becomes a mom too.  Thank you so very much for the loving moments I have relived and shared with my son because of this song.  I love you, Dad, from your daughter, Sharon.  (My face is wet with tears.) I had this song on a 45 RPM record that belonged to my parents and I shared it with someone and lost it.  Thank Heaven for the internet and bringing classics like this song to CD. I purchased this CD for the song, ""The Men in My Little Girl's Life,"" but I found I enjoyed every one of the songs.  I used to watch the Mike Douglas Show and heard him sing once in a while, but I didn't realize until I heard this whole CD what a great singer Mike Douglas was! Remember watching his daytiime talk show in the 60's faithfully, and the first time he sang the title song (which he wrote).  Actually sobbed -- and still do.  He really had a great voice!!  The other oldies on the CD are just OK.  Definitely for us oldtimers. The title song &quot;The Men In My Little Girls Life&quot; is a nice little collectable tune that was a hit in the mid-sixties, but the Collectable label has not done it recording justice.  This whole album was  recorded at a much less than dynamic level and the title track has 2 very  audible pops in it; not unlike a used LP.  I collect old music on CD, but  have always been wary of the Collectable brand.  Whether or not you will  get a good copy from them has always be a toss of the dice.  Buy the other  album by Mike Douglas here. It brought me back to the days of watching Mike Douglas with my family on TV. The title and Sunrise Sunset made me cry as I remember my Dad and those songs.

330,662,B00000091K,"Pianist/arranger and band leader Archie Bleyer (born in Queens, New York on June 12, 1909) began his lengthy career in the early 1930s and, after heading his own band at Earl Carroll's Hollywood nightclub, recorded rather prolifically for a series of labels including Vocalion, Perfect, Melotone, Rome, Oriole without ever gaining a toehold on what then passed as the national singles charts.His association with the ultra-egomaniac and control-freak Arthur Godfery's TV show is well documented up to and including his sacking by Godfrey along with singer Julius LaRosa and The Chordettes. But that didn't slow down his career one iota as he and his various musical gatherings would go on to back the afore-mentioned artists and many more, including Andy Williams, Johnny Tillotson, Lennie Welch, Kay Thompson, Bill Hayes, Joyce Hahn and others at his new Cadence Records label for the next couple of decades.Along the way he'd find time to sporadically release records of his own music (usually with a chorus), three of which became nationally-charting singles. On one of those he went head-to-head with the great Guy Lombardo & His Royal Canadians at Decca and Johnny Ray at Colombia with his rendition of Hernando's Hideaway from the Broadway musical The Pajama Game, and when the dust clear there was Archie sitting at # 2 in the June-July stretch of 1954 billed as Archie Bleyer & His Orchestra with Chorus - Maria Alba Castanet Soloist on Cadence 1241 b/w S'il Vous Plait. The Lombardo and Ray versions had to settle for a # 14 each. The only thing keeping him from a # 1 was the 9 weeks spent there in that period by Kitty Kallen's Little Things Mean A Lot.And before the year was out he was back with the # 17 The Naughty Lady Of Shady Lane in Dec 1954-Jan 1955 b/w While The Vesper Bells Were Ringing on Cadence 1254, losing out this time to the rendition by The Ames Brothers at RCA Victor. His final charting side didn't come until July 1956 when the Steve Allen-penned The Rockin' Ghost peaked at # 61 Pop b/w Sleep, Sleep Daughter as Cadence 1293.All three charted sides are in this Collectables volume which has excellent sound reproduction and interesting liner notes by Mark Marymont. But if there's a fault it's in the omission of all three B-sides - which won't please diehard completist hits collectors, especially in light of the inclusion of 5 failed single sides: Jocko's Theme which was the flip of Strange One on Cadence 1313 in 1957; Jimmie's Blues b/w Mustafa on Cadence 1383 in 1960; and Moonlight Serenade b/w Sunrise Serenade on Cadence 1426 in 1962.Tracks 2 to 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 are from his lone sole LP ""Moonlight Serenade"" (Cadence CLP-3044/CLP-25044) which emerged in 1961.If you're interested, his other single releases - no sides of which are in this volume - are shown in the comments below.Archie passed away at age 80 in Wisconsin on March 20, 1989. This CD includes the only two hits that Archie Bleyer ever really had: ""The Naughty Lady of Shady Lane"" (which shared chart honors with another version by the Ames Brothers) and ""Hernando's Hideaway."" If you know the sound of these two, however, you will be surprised to hear the other songs on the disk. Those two both had vocal choruses, while everything else on the CD is an instrumental. While they sound pretty good, those instrumentals aren't what you might be expecting if you buy this CD based on knowing the two hits.Still, nothing on here sounds bad, and it does have two authentic hit songs, the most hits you can get of Bleyer! I must admit that I bought this cd strictly for the Hernando's Hideaway song, but found other jewels on the album.  I am happy that I have this in my collection.","Vocal Pop,Oldies & Retro,Oldies,Pop,Rock",pianist arranger band leader archie bleyer born queens new york june began lengthy career early heading band earl carrolls hollywood nightclub recorded rather prolifically series labels including vocalion perfect melotone rome oriole without ever gaining toehold passed national singles charts association ultra egomaniac control freak arthur godferys tv show well documented including sacking godfrey along singer julius larosa chordettes didnt slow career one iota various musical gatherings would go back afore mentioned artists many including andy williams johnny tillotson lennie welch kay thompson bill hayes joyce hahn others new cadence records label next couple decades along way hed find time sporadically release records usually chorus three became na pianist arranger band band leader leader archie archie bleyer born queens new new york york june began lengthy career early heading band earl carrolls hollywood nightclub recorded prolifically series labels including vocalion perfect rome oriole gaining toehold passed national singles singles charts charts association ultra egomaniac control control freak freak tv tv show show documented including sacking godfrey singer julius larosa larosa chordettes slow career iota musical gatherings go back mentioned artists including johnny tillotson lennie welch kay kay thompson bill bill hayes joyce hahn new cadence cadence records records label couple decades way find time sporadically release release records records usually chorus

332,666,B00000093L,"Damita Jo DuBlanc, born in 1930 in Austin, Texas, had exactly seven hit singles on her own from 1960 to 1967 and, in a compilation titled ""The Very Best Of,"" our friends at Collectables contrive to leave off three of those hits. AND all seven B-sides in a 16-track release.After singing in the band of one-time husband Steve Gibson [& The Red Caps  - she was married to him twice, once from 1951 to 1953, and again fron 1959 to 1960 - she hit it big in late 1960 with an answer song to The Drifters' Save The Last Dance For Me. With the backing of the Cliff Parman orchestra on the Mercury label, I'll Save The Last Dance For You made it to # 16 R&B;/# 22 Billboard Pop Hot 100 b/w Forgive. Several months later she took an old Jay McShann/Priscilla Bowman # 1 R&B; hit tune, Hands Off, to # 75 Hot 100 as Keep Your Hands Off Of Him with the backing of Belford Hendricks and his orchestra and The Mike Stewart Singers. That is not included here, nor is the flipside Hush, Somebody's Calling My Name.For her third Mercuty hit, in the summer of 1961, she went back to the ""answer song"" mode with a response to Ben E. King's Stand By Me. With Chuck Sagle and his orchestra backing, I'll Be There peaked at # 12 Hot 100/# 15 R&B; b/w Love Laid Its Hands On Me. It would then be four long years before her fourth hit single when, now with Columbia's Epic subsidiary, she had yet another real oldie, Bessie Smith's # 15 hit from 1929, Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out (track 3), reach # 30 on the Adult Contemporary (AC) charts in August 1965, b/w a cover of The Ink Spots 1940 hit, Whispering Grass (Don't Tell The Trees) - which isn't here. Over a year later she took a French song with new English lyrics by Rod McKuen called If You Go Away to # 10 AC/# 68 Hot 100 in December 1966/January 1967 (track 13) b/w When The Fog Rolls In To San Francisco, both with the backing of Leroy Glover and his orchestra. The B-side is omitted.In 1967 she added two more AC hits, with Yellow Days reaching # 34 in August b/w No Guilty Feelings, and in December, Walk Away, from the Broadway Musical How Now, Dow Jones, settled in at # 28 b/w Dinner For One Please James. None are in this volume.In 1977 Damita Jo would appear on the Redd Foxx Show, and on Christmas Day 1998 she sadly passed away at age 68 from a respiratory illness. Katherine Jackson, matriarch of the famous Jackson Family, upon the birth of her youngest daughter, born on May 16, 1966, named her Janet Damita Jo Jackson, and in 2004, the now-famous Janet herself named her newest album after Damita Jo, explaining that ""Damita Jo is one of the characters that lives inside of me.""Why would Collectables put together this compilation in her honour, and under that bold title, and then go on to leave out so much of her musical legacy? It's just unforgiveable. Damita Jo DE BLANC was just one of the famous people in our family. Her music transcends time. I for one appreciate the positive comments here and other places about her. I purchased this CD for one cut -- ""If You Go Away"" written by Jacques Brel and put into English by Rod McKuen.  It is a record I had on a 45, but I am most glad to have it now in digital form.  Anyone with an ounce of romanticism in their being will love this song. Ohhh, how well I remember avidly listening to Damita Jo's hit song of &#34;I'll save the last dance for you&#34; in the years gone by. Browsing through Amazon one day recently, I came across this cd. I was after that one particular song, and found it, by the original singer. If you have fond memories of this song, then this cd is for you. The entire cd is very good value for your money. I bought it, I like it and so will you. takes you back to a different time , feels like i should have a martini in one hand and a person on my arm,hanging in the club.dancing 'till late.

334,670,B000000949,"As an old country music radio jock I have more than a passing interest and knowledge of the music. I recently purchased this CD in a group of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums (CDs).The music starts off great but then goes downhill when you hear that several of the tracks are presented with &quot;Concerthall&quot; effects. I call it echo.Locklin always had a pristine clear voice but this presentation simply muddles it up.If you are a true Locklin fan, as I am, then you should look elsewhere. It might help to point out that there are two different Hank Locklin packages called ""Please Help Me I'm Falling,"" one is a single-disc collection that I believe is the one that another reviewer says has bad, fake-stereo remastering... The other is a four-CD box set on the Bear Family label, which is pretty much guaranteed NOT to have funky sound quality, and gathers a lot of Locklin's classic work on the RCA label in the 1960s.Hope this helps sort out the two. I really like listening to Hank Locklin.  He truely has old fashion country flavor.  Reminds me of better times and listening to country radio. i am a real country music fan i am 58 years old i grew up with hank willams  miss kitty wells and a lot more on saterday night my mom would toon in wwva wheeling west va.i can say the service with amazon is great.henry j whitney I've been looking for this song for several years because there is a Danish version of it and I wanted to hear what the original sounded like. This Hank Locklin Cd brings back fond memories of my collection of Country 45's and lp's from the Fifties and Sixties. An excellent compilation from that era.  This is the sound I grew up with.

336,673,B00000098D,"This is really a nice CD.  I had purchase the cassette years ago, so I wanted the CD. So underated. Her jazzy voice just takes you away. All 12 songs are great. My favorites are &quot;When You Get Right Down To It, Don't Wanna Change The World and Walk Away.&quot; If you are building a Phyllis Hyman  collection and don't have the &quot;Prime of my Life&quot; CD, you are  truely missing a Great CD. I am still waiting on a voice to replace hers  today. Phyllis is definately in her own class! I knew of phyllis before her untimely death.But i had never bought any of her work.In 1991 she released ""prime of my life"" and i was and still am blown away.It would be her last original body of work before her tragic demise in 1994.She makes me wish with this album and alot of her other works that i could have known her personally, to receive all of the passion and love that she sang about in her songs.If you love romantic songs or ""Great"" music, this cd is a ""Must"".(""I found love"",""Prime of my life"",""When i give my love(this time)"",""living in confusion"",""meet me on the moon"")are the absolute jams! Absolutely great music.  Her voice takes you to another place. Love it. Love her and her music. Best female singer of her time. I have been looking for Miss Hyman's albums for years!  The songs mean so much to me!  I recently lost my husband and we both loved Phyllis Hyman!  I miss them both, but these songs bring back so many beutiful memories!!!  Thank you for making them available!  I give them 5 stars!!! Prime of My Life was self poetic of Phyllis.  She found her place and she was very comfortable with in her place on this CD.  The songs, many of which spoke her truest feelings.  It was her self assured title track that let her fans know that she was in her Prime.  She exuded true poise and sophistication.  Each track showed that she was in her zone and she was there to stay, even if for just a little while.  Although she was a self admitted ballad queen, which is shown in the romantic track, Meet Me on the Moon and I've Found Love, somehow she kept finding her place and her voice on the dance floor with the #1 release, Don't Wanna Change The World.  Not only does she tell the man that she doesn't want to change his world, she lays down a serious rap, and when she's finished, she asks, ""Understand what I'm sayin'?""  It doesn't get any better than that.Then you move from that onto the trademark and heartfelt heartbreak tunes that Phyllis fans know her for:  Whatever Happened to Our Love, When I Give My Love This Time and Walk Away.  Alas, one mustn't forget the liberating tunes that she poetically recites in the most controlled voice at that point in her career:  Living In Confusion, I Can't Take It Anymore and the When I Give My Love This Time.  She makes the transition on this album seamless.  It proved to those fans old and new that she was a woman in her Prime--listen to her roar a tune in a sophistication and class that solely belongs to Phyllis. ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE SINGERS OF HER TIME GONE TO SOON AND WILL BE FOREVER MISSED.  HER VOICE AND THE WAY SHE BARED HER SOUL IN A SONG YOU COULD JUST FEEL HER STORY AND PAIN AS SHE SONG. The cd arrived as promised. The case had a crack in it, but otherwise everything went well. Thank you for providing a cd I can continue to enjoy. I have always been a fan of Phyllis Hyman and I am very pleased with this purchase. The album brings back wonderful memories of my past. Love it! I love this album.  CAN'T get enough of Phyllis Hyman too bad she's not alive. A shame her music would be even better Prime of my life. The title ""says it all"". In my opinion one of Ms.Hyman's finest maybe her best (after ""I refuse to be lonely""). I especially love the songs ""I found love"", ""Don't wanna change the world"" (her first #1 hit), ""Prime of my life"", ""Living in confusion"" (one of my personal favorites), ""Meet me on the moon"" and ""What ever happened to our love"". Furthermore I love the entire CD, especially ""Walk away"" in which she stretches her voice to almost pleading. Personally, I love her voice and the way she sings (she really draws you in). I only hope that more people will come to discover this beautiful gift in the form of Ms. Phyllis Hyman (God bless her soul). Definitely worth purchasing! This is a must have for any true r&b fan of music.  This cd deals with one's emotions and feelings in every aspect when it comes to loving someone. Phyllis Hyman's songs are timeless and still sounds good. This cd should be in any music lover's collection. WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS LOVELY CREATURE WHO ROBBED US OF HER TALENT AND HER BEAUTY.I BOUGHT THIS CD WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND PLAYED IT EVERY SINCE FINALLY HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE I'VE PLAYED PRACTICALLY EVERDAY SINCE ITS ORIGINAL RELEASE EVERY SONG SOMEONE CAN RELATE TO WHAT THE DIVA IS SAYING ESPECIALLY &quot;MEET ME ON THE MOON&quot; IT GIVES ME GOOSE EVERY TIME I PLAY IT WHAT A TRAGIC WASTE WE WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT HAVE BECOME OF HER AND HER MUSIC SINCE HER UNTIMELY PASSING ALL WE HAVE ARE HER RECORDINGS TO GET US THRU.... I'm only 21 but i know good music when i hear it. I love everything about Phyllis Hyman. Prime Of My Life his my favorite album by her. You can hear the pain in her voice, you can feel her joy and love through the lyric's. She stands out as a R&B and Jazz legend. She is truely missed. &quot;Prime Of My Life&quot; is frequently considered one of the  Sophisticated Lady's best albums, and there are many reasons why.  Enduring  distribution issues with PIR, Phyllis seized the opportunity to perform  many of the songs from this album during her live performances; thereby  giving her truly passionate audience a sneak preview of things to come.  The material was very well-received and the first single, &quot;Don't Wanna  Change The World,&quot; climbed to the number one spot on the R&amp;B  charts.  Alas, this would be her only song to reach that plateau.  The  follow up single, the aching ballad, &quot;Living In Confusion,&quot;  echoed Phyllis' long-standing history to sing songs with integrity.  &quot;When You Get Right Down To It&quot; continued her love affair of  blending R&amp;B with jazz, with soothing quiet storms resulting.  &quot;I  Found Love&quot; supplemented the selection of singles, providing a tender  ballad of joy and happiness.In addition, the album tracks stand strong  on their own and are worth mentioning.  &quot;Prime Of My Life&quot; may  have suggested Phyllis' state of mind during this time, despite her  troubled soul that she fought long and hard to overcome.  Perhaps &quot;I  Can't Take It Anymore&quot; was an early hint of just how difficult her  inner demons were becoming to her.By far, the two tracks which stand out  for any Phyllis Hyman fan are &quot;When I Give My Love (This Time)&quot;  and &quot;Meet Me On The Moon.&quot;  No sweeter sound can be heard than by  playing these tracks back to back.  &quot;When I Give My Love (This  Time)&quot; is a true torch song in every sense of the word.  It creeps up  on you from the opening drum tap, to the picking of the electric guitar and  flowing bassline.  Her vocals are smooth and tender...building to a  crescendo so high that you never want to come down.  Her vocal delivery is  adamant, confident and assured.&quot;Meet Me On The Moon&quot; sneaks in  with a piano tickle.  If a voice could every be carried on the clouds  above, then this is how it would sound.  No romantic evening is complete  without the blessing of hearing this ballad.  It is known that this was one  of Phyllis' favorite songs from her repertoire.  In fact, she had to fight  to have it included on this project.  She performed it a cappella to Kenny  Gamble one morning, determined with her passion for the song.  The decision  to include it was indeed a wise one.If you can only pick up a precious  few of her albums, this must be one of them.  Highly recommended for the  true music and vocalist lover. What a gorgeous song....when I heard this I fell in love with Phyllis Hyman..and her voice....beautiful.....she gives me hope.... But unfortunately the title cut is less than fabulous.  Although the sentiment is commendable the music is less than satisfying.  In addition to there being a few other average cuts I had to reduce my rating on this otherwise fabulous CD.Phyllis is more than a singer.  I would have to consider her a song stylist.  She brings so much raw emotion to her performances.  Whether she's jammin to a dance cut or belting out one of her incomparable ballads.  The two most notable on this disc are When I give my love and of course Meet me on the moon.  It can't get any better than these.Definitely worth a purchase. I LOVE THIS CD.  I USE TO OWN IT BUT I LOST IT YEARS AGO. i'm so glade to replace it again. ""Walk Away"", ""Living In Confusion"", ""I Found Love"", ""Meet Me On The Moon"" and  the title track are all gorgeous ballads which were perfect for Phyllis and which prove just what a great songstress she was. Although the Hip-Hop/New Jack Swing-flavored ""Don't Wanna Change The World"" became Phyllis' first-ever #1 hit it sounds very dated in comparison to the above-mentioned timeless ballads. Phyllis was one of the greatest-ever romantic balladeers and this CD is second only to ""Living All Alone"" in terms of overall musical quality. Buy it if you don't yet have it! What else can you say about this CD?  It is absolute heaven.  Every song sounds so carefully produced.  Phyllis' performance is breath-taking throughout the entire CD.  The astonishing &quot;Meet Me On The Moon&quot; is worth the price of the CD alone.  I am lucky enough to have the Japanese Import version of this CD, which contains a bonus track, &quot;Hottest Love Around&quot;, which was not included on the American release.If you listen carefully, &quot;Prime of My Life&quot; tells a story.  A story of love.  A story about falling in love.  A story about troubled love.  A story about falling out of love.  A story of healing and reflection.  This was not only Phyllis' story, but the story of so many others.  I think this is why this was Hyman's most successful album because so many people could relate to what she was singing about.Without a doubt, &quot;Prime of My Life&quot; is Phyllis' best work. Brilliant is the only word I can come up with to describe this CD. I still mourn her passing to this day.  She left a void in the music industry that will never be filled during our lifetime. I still remember where I was when I heard that this wonderfully talented woman had taken her own life. This is the last CD she made before her untimely death, and I think it's her best. I don't think it was any  accident that it's titled &quot;Prime of Life.&quot; Her talent was matched  by her imposing physical presence. I think she was about 6 feet tall. I met  her once at The Black Expo in Manhattan back in '90. She was so gracious  and even posed for pictures.What can I say about that voice? It's husky,  impassioned and supple -- absolutely inimitable. When I get married, I  intend to use &quot;Meet Me on the Moon&quot; in the wedding. Those lyrics  are so earnest and Phyllis sings them with such conviction --&quot;You be  my love and I'll be yours too. As long as the sun warms the heavens. Tell  me. You be my love and here's what we'll do. We'll skywrite our love  through the heavens&quot; -- I don't think there will be a dry eye in the  house. The printed word does this song no justice. &quot;I found Love&quot;  is also a very sweet ballad. I enjoyed them all.A friend once said of  Phyllis &quot;She was the bomb, and she didn't even know it.&quot; So true.  At least she left behind a beautiful musical legacy. RIP. Phyllis Hyman, what an excellent singer and tremendous performer.  I own almost everything she has recorded.  This CD still to this day is in my CD player on a regular basis.  The world is definitely missing her.  I know I am.  Imagine if she were here we would be privileged to hear more from her.  I can't express the love I have for this artist and her music.  The song Meet Me On The Moon is one of my all time favorites.  This CD is a Must if you don't own it. A few nice ballads but not as good as the Legacy of Phyllis Hyman Album which I consider her best work regarding songs that made her famous and a legend as a female  Jass and Rhythm/Blues Singer .Nestor R. Mantilla Once again, but not to my suprise, Amazon does what Amazon says. I received my product fast and in mint condition!  There is one reasonI am a repeat customer: It's Amazon! Maybe in death Hyman will acquire the status that she missed in life.  Hers is one of the most dynamic voices ever to be put on tape.  A Broadway performer, pop/R& B charter, a chanteuse with no competition, Hyman could do it all.""Prime of My Life"" is - excuse the redundancy - a PRIME example of the singer at her most alluring and emotional.  No wasted filler here, EVERY entry is a ""must-hear"". This 1991 lp is one of her best. She only has one #1 song in her singing career ""Don't Want To Change It"" from this lp. This is another remarkable collection of recordings from Hyman. I had it on cassette. I played it so much the tape would not change from side on the side 2 in my new Lincoln. Does that tell you how great this one is. The title track ""Prime Of My Life"" cries with that Phyllis emotion no one can give but her. Never hesitate to get this or any other Phyllis Hyman lp. A voice that will be missed but not forgotten. We love you Phyllis. Why did she have to go so soon...God picked his flower so I know that the choir in shy is greatly happy to sing with her...R.I.PThanks for all the great music Prime Of My Life is a wonderful CD that showcases Phyllis' powerful vocals.  I love every song from ""When You Get Right Down To It"" to ""Whatever Happened to Our Love,"" and you all know that's the whole CD.  If you can find a customized remastered version of this CD, there are some bonus tracks on there.  If you don't have this, I recommend you buy it pronto, and buy every Phyllis Hyman CD that you possibly can.  Phyllis is irreplacable; she's a legend, and I hope that she's happy and at peace.See you on the other side, Phyllis.  I love you!!! This singer was under-appreciated for a long time, but this CD is almost perfect as Phylis works with old 'Philly Sound' producers Gamble & Huff to give us 'When I Give My Love (this time)', and 'Meet Me On The Moon', 'Living In Confusion', and more. Phyllis' vocals are on point throught the entire CD, but the hits song, 'Don't Wanna Change The World', sticks out from the rest of the songs (and not in a good way either!). While it was Phyllis' biggest hit single, it hasn't aged well, and hearing the Diva rap isn't cool at all.The rare bonus track recorded during the same sessions, 'Hottest Love Around', was previously available on inported editions of the CD, and is now available on the great 'In Between The Heartaches' compilation, which is also a must have. This album brings back old memories. I grew up singing this album with Phyllis. I use to sing it to my baby, while holding her in my arms, when she was little. I was very sad to hear that she had killed herself. It still hurts to this day. I been wanting to buy this album for awhile now and I finally found it on amazon.com. As I play the samples, my sister and mom are telling me to order this album for them NOW! This album is just that deep.Thank You Amazon.com A definite must have for any R&B fan to own. Own this CD in your personal collection you will impress your friend!!!!!! Phyllis Hyman's ""Prime of My Life"" is a modern classic.  Released in 1991, Ms. Hyman seemed more confident and self-assured on ""Prime"" than she did on previous and subsequent recordings during her painfully short career (we lost her way too soon).  Unlike many of her albums, the material seems perfectly suited for her gorgeous contralto voice and her obvious sophistication, the only misstep being the overly trendy ""Don't Wanna Change the World.""As I write this, I am listening to ""Meet Me On the Moon,"" my favorite track and one of the many fine ballads that form the heart of ""Prime of My Life"".  It is at once elegant, contemplative and very sexy without resorting to cliches or excessive vamping.  The tracks ""When I Give My Love (This Time)"" and the Quiet Storm radio hit ""Living in Confusion"" exhibit similar qualities, but in their own unique way.  Other highlights include the sublime ""When You Get Right Down To It"" with special guest background vocals from R&B; legend Betty Wright, the confident title track and the classy ""Walk Away.""If you like sophistcated R&B; at its best, this is a good place to hear it.  Buy without hesitation. Phyllis Hyman's voice is so smooth and so real when you listen to it you are captured into her spell, What a voice i love all the ballards you can feel it from your head to your toes. I dont know what happened in her life that it got so bad that she would take her life, but listening to her music it seems that she is still here. Phyllis lives on in her music. There are many critics and fans who consider this Phyllis' best, and I certainly put it in the top three.  &quot;Don't Wanna Change the World&quot; is a catchy dance tune that features Phyllis in a sexy little  rap.  &quot;I Found Love&quot; is a gorgeous ballad, &quot;When You Get  Right Down To It&quot; is an affirmation of moving on from a bad love  affair that is a toe-tapping infectious anthem.  &quot;When I Give My  Love&quot; is a breath-takingly soft song that she builds to a emotional  climax, &quot;Prime Of My Life&quot; is Phyllis strong and transformed,  &quot;Walk Away&quot; showcases the sheer power of her voice, but the gem  on this CD is &quot;Meet Me On The Moon&quot;, a personal favorite of  Phyllis.  This song allows her to use that VOICE to the fullest, weaving a  musical journey that lifts you and carries you to  a place that is pure  Phyllis.  You won't want to leave.  Buy two copies of this one, one for  yourself and one for someone you love. That voice is beyond the signature of incredible power.......and control.....that lady had AMAZING CONTROLLLLLLLL!!! god, have u ever heard ""Living In Confusion (The Album Version)"" WOWWWW!!When she yelled out ""LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!"" wow,she must have really be tired of going through what she was going through at that time she co-wrote the song......thats one thing about any song phyllis hyman sings,she convinces u to the maximum , that what shes singing about is the absolute truth......OMG,I love Phyllis so much.....she is juss my mentor,my inspiration......i wish i had enough money to buy every thing by her at one time.....believe me......u cant go wrong with anything Phyllis sings,its just straight up down to earth material,incredible power......strong lyrical arrangements....I LOVE U PHYLLIS!!!!

337,674,B000000990,"Girlfriend is a great album, with plenty of catchy tunes, nice guitar work, and insightful lyrics.This album is better. I don't like ""Falling"" that much. Beyond that, the songs are all masterful. You will be hard-pressed to find an album that varies in style of song as much as this, yet still produces excellent tracks. Kudos to Matt for not simply replicating ""Girlfriend."" Instead, this is darker and angrier in both its lyrics and manic guitar work (Quine and Lloyd are out of their minds on this).The mix is perhaps a bit sloppy and muddled at times (if ever an album deserved a remaster it's this), but other than that, there is nothing to criticize on this album.This is power-pop, so you can pop it in for a good time, but I think it is even better for rocking out (""Dinosaur Act,"" ""Devil with the Green Eyes"" or the insane ""In too Deep""), or moping (""Knowing People,"" ""Someone to Pull the Trigger,"" ""What do you know?""). I know of no album that can pull this off. The hippy-country vibes of ""What do you know,"" ""Ugly Truth"" and ""Time Capsule"" are so well orchestrated!The most depressing thing about this album is that it was not a success, and that it is relatively unheard of. Sweet has so much natural song-writing talent it is disgusting. If you want further proof, try to track down Superdeformed 1 & 2, which are B-sides and demos from this time period. This album could have been twice as long (as in, a double-album) and the quality would not have gone down. Yes, I am suggesting he wrote about 25 songs that are excellent. Most good albums by others are lucky to have 3-5 good songs.It took me a long time to get around to writing this review, since it always gets me frustrated when I think about how criminally underappreciated it is. Obviously, only my subjective opinion, but this is better than the best Beatles album, Smiths album, Police album, Who album. It is just a snapshot from an incredible moment in time when God leaned over and whispered in Sweet's ear for a couple of years. Are you going to forego the opportunity to witness such ""Divine Intervention?"" Of course not. GET THIS ALBUM! At the time, people were rather disappointed by this album (if I recall correctly, Rolling Stone even gave it the piddly rating of 2 stars, showing how much they usually know about good music).  Everyone expected a straight  sequel to &quot;Girlfriend,&quot; not a morbid collection of songs about  lost love, the loss of faith, and death.Guess what?In nearly every  way, this is a far superior album to &quot;Girlfriend,&quot; especially in  terms of songwriting.  &quot;Devil With The Green Eyes&quot; and &quot;What  Do *You* Know?&quot; are bitter attacks on a (former) loved one, while  &quot;The Ugly Truth&quot; and &quot;Falling&quot; deal more directly with  the question of faith, or the lack thereof.  And then there's &quot;Someone  To Pull The Trigger,&quot; an unnerving plea for destruction which ranks  among the best songs Sweet has ever recorded.Not all the songs are that  impressive, but even lesser songs like &quot;Knowing People&quot; have  their moments and pull you along from song to song.  Finally, though,  there's &quot;Evergreen:&quot;  &quot;In every love there is a promise/so  baby don't you cry/There's no difference/Between the earth and the  sky/there's no reason/we have to die.&quot;On a personal note:  I bought  this CD the day it was released and rushed home expecting to hear  &quot;Girlfriend Jr.&quot;  I didn't get it, of course, but it ended up  growing on me.  As I got older and went through some rough times, I often  turned to this album in moments of despair and it got me through.  I can't  express how powerfully emotional it is for me, but I do think it ought to  be in any essential music collection.  It may not be easy listening, but  when was art ever easy? I was hoping for &quot;Girlfriend II&quot; with this album and was let down to not have an immediate handful of crisp hits.  But over time I realized that this album as a whole is more solid, and nourishing.  It has beautiful melodies, lyrics, and of course guitar work.  And the piano is gorgeous at times.  One of my favorites. Thanks for listening. After several spins of Sweet's Altered Beast, I carefully checked the CD booklet looking for the names of former Big Star members. To my surprise, I  found drummer Jody Stevens on just one cut (Life Without You). But like the  work of Big Star, Altered Beast is a shinning collection Lennon/McCartney  mesmerizing melodies (Someone To Pull The Trigger, Life Without You), Pete  Townshend lightning axe chops (Ugly Truth Rock, In Too Deep), and Hollies  angelic vocal harmonies (Devil With The Green Eyes, Reaching  Out).Although masterfully crafted, the overall sound of Altered Beast is  loose and, at times, ramshackle. Elegant lead guitar lines are provided by  Robert Quine and Richard LLoyd. These guys prance inside, outside and all  around the vocal melodies and bass guitar rhythms. Generally, tightly  structured rock doesn't leave much room for ""improvisation,"" but these two  virtuosos saunter just wherever the heck they please. I admire Sweet not  because he's an early seventies power pop imitator, but because of his rare  ability to synthesize the finest rock attributes of the past four decades  into a solitary musical vision. Sweet is surly not ""stuck"" in the past, but  he gives more than nod of approval to ""old"" rockers such as Rolling Stones  keyboardist Nicky Hopkins. Hopkins' deft and understated work is featured  on four compositions here; unfortunately, one of rocks most in demand  session players passed away a year after Altered Beast was  recorded.Altered Beast may feature Matthew Sweet's name on the cover,  but this is the work of a balanced and cohesive band. No one member  upstages the others. No one member (in the final production) said ""Hey,  turn my stuff up. I'm the big star."" Altered Beast is alluring, powerful  and inventive. Power pop doesn't get much prettier or more potent than  Matthew Sweet. I first started listening to Matthew Sweet in the summer of 1993. It was the summer between 9th and 10th grade. I would stay up late every Sunday night and watch 120 minutes on MTV, when the used to play vidoes.They would play my two favorite songs that summer , ""Cherub Rock (smashing pumpkins)"", and ""Time Capsule (matthew sweet)"".I worked a crapy part-time job making 4.25 an hour. I only worked 8 hours a week. A soon as got my first paycheck, which was only 27 dollars, I walked to the mall and bought ""Altered Beast"", and ""Simease Dream"" on cassette. That took all my money because cassettes in 1993 were 11.99. I played it until I wore it out. When I finally got my Cd player for christmas that year, those were the first two Cds I bought.This Cd is still great 13 years later.1. Dinosaur Act - great opening track, it shows that Matthew can rock pretty good.2. Devil With Green Eyes - It's one of my favorite songs on the Cd. It's one his more mellow songs.3. The Ugly Truth - this the mellow version of this single4. Time Capsule - One my favorite songs on this CD. It's was his second single on this record. Do you remember the video ? It's just him laying in a grass field with bugs and worms crawling on him.5. Someone to Pull the Trigger - Hands down the best song on this CD. It's mellow and rocking at the same time.6. Knowing People - It's kind of an anthem that he doesn't want to become famous. He really never did. A great song.7. Life without You - your basic slow Matthew Sweet love song. It's an alright song.8. Intro - It's excerpts from the movie ""Caligula"". ""He's a God Now""9. Ugly Truth Rock - The single version. This was the first single from this record. The video is Matthew driving a dodge dart, running from the police. There is a dead body in the trunk.10. Do it Again - a pretty good song. A slow love song.11. In Too Deap - One the better tracks off this album. Pretty good guitar and vocals in this song.12. Reaching Out - A pretty good song.13. Falling - A pretty good song. A slower song.14. What do you Know ? - A decent track. Show how melodic Matthew is.15. Everygreen - This is a very dood track to end the record with. It's pretty mellow. He like to end his records on mellow songs.I higly reconmend picking up this Cd. I &quot;discovered&quot; Matthew Sweet about a year ago through his greatest hits CD and have purchased most of his work since then.Based on reviews that I have read on Amazon, this is the last of the CD's in Sweet's collection that I bought.  It isn't as good as others, but it is still better than 99% of the other junk that passes for music that is out there. I have been a lifelong Todd Rundgren fan, and it was nice to discover that there is someone like Todd who is not afraid to push the envelope, but still write some good tunes. This is not just Matthew Sweet's best record; it may be most people's best record, an irresistibly catchy, infectious, addicting combination of sinister lyrics, inescapable hooks, jangly guitar riffs, and Sweet's own sweet-and-sour vocals.  He doesn't so much lift from his influences as he liquifies them down to their essential magic, and then strains them through his unique gifts, to come up with something new and invaluable.  ""Time Capsule"" is a great lover's lament, featuring a Fleetwood Mac-like shimmering vocal and barbed-wire guitar; ""Devil with the Green Eyes"" takes on jealousy with a kind of sugar-coated menace; ""Ugly Truth"" features a Dylanesque snarl, presented twice on the album, once as a folk song and then as a punky rocker; ""What Do You Know?"" is a cheerful kiss-off.  Sweet deserves to sell a gajillion albums, and a gajillion more concert tickets; he puts on a ... good show- I saw him once, at Liberty Lunch in Austin, and he flat-out rocked that place to the ground.  He's putting a commercially unpopular (at least at the moment) sound, and doing it better than just about anybody else; the next time you hear the phrase ""pop music"", forget those ... boy bands and listen to Matthew Sweet, so you know what the term should really mean: something as cool as this. Here's a tricky question for you.  Say that you happen to be Mr. Matthew Sweet, and you have just made an album called &quot;Girlfriend.&quot;  That album is so good that there are actually round table disscusions held in  the music industry that vainly try to decipher why this is one of the best  albums ever made.  Such claims about &quot;Girlfriend&quot; are not made in  vain, and on top of all the accolades, you have now become somewhat of a  household name. So now that you're in this compromising artistic situation,  what are you, as Matthew Sweet, possibly going to do next?  Retire from  music forever?  I guess that is feasable.  Turn your next album into  &quot;Girfriend II?&quot;  Maybe the Mtv crowd would like that, but it is  not an appealing proposition.  The solution to all this drama is to make an  album called &quot;Altered Beast.&quot;  Good move, Matthew: not only is it  a great album, it deftly stands up to, and in some ways surpasses the  towering monolith you created with &quot;Girlfriend&quot;. When  &quot;Altered Beast&quot; first appeared I was an absolute Matthew Sweet  fanatic, and this album is largely responsible for my admiration of the  artist.  To me, this is one of those albums, much like Nirvana's  &quot;Nevermind,&quot; Guided by Voices' &quot;Bee Thousand,&quot; or  Supergrass' &quot;I Should Coco,&quot; that instantly transports me back to  a memorable period in my life.  Admittedly, much of what I was doing at  that time was driving around and incessantly listening to &quot;Altered  Beast.&quot;  But the album had so deeply lodged itself in my psyche that I  will think of it fondly for the rest of my life.  I realize that might  sound pithy, but I will readily admit that &quot;Girlfriend&quot; did not  make a similar immpression upon the fabric of my soul, although I do like  that album very much. Everything you hear about this album will say that it  is very &quot;dark&quot;, as though that were a bad thing.  The best way  that I can deflate this criticism is to ask you to consider the collossal  financial success of mopeheads Marilyn Manson and NIN.  Nobody complains  about oppressive darkness there, and though I don't know for sure, I don't  think that their albums contain sad songs that somehow convey a hope for  tommorow.  Besides, even &quot;Girlfriend&quot; is a sad album.  Disagree?  Well, then how come that album's song &quot;Winona&quot; is one of the  saddest songs ever made? To sum up, if I had to direct a curious Sweet fan  to an introductory album, I would have to direct them to  &quot;Girlfriend.&quot;  I do this because &quot;Girlfriend&quot; is a  surefire winner, and it will probably leave listeners wanting to hear more.  But the sentimental side of me is just screaming to direct that fan to  &quot;Altered Beast.&quot;  It's an all-time keeper, and it shows in every  single sweetly ringing, albeit downcast note.  And don't be afraid that  &quot;Beast&quot; is just another beer to hold your tears:  &quot;Beast&quot; is also full of heavy, grinding rockers that are probably  going to make your head bop, and are doubtless going to make you feel good.  Go there to be inspired, and you will see a talented artist transcending  his peers and his influences, and becoming his own artist, and in the  process, making an album that will follow you for the rest of your  music-loving existence. this whole cd is great but time capsule is it's masterpiece. i could hear this tune everyday and not grow tired of it. check it out for yourself. This from Spain; i'd love to hear these songs in a car across the U.S.A., searchin' for a heart of gold, thinkin' about a girl i left behind... Sadly, we live in a era where there just isn't that much music made that is worth listening to, and when an artist makes a great work of music, it is all to often lost amisdt the waves of artists with &quot;radio-friendly  songs&quot; but little if any true inspiration or substance to their music.  Altered Beast is an excellent example of how a great work can be swept  under the rug like this.  I had never been much of a Mathew Sweet fan until  a friend and long time  Sweet fan let me listen to this album.  Since then,  I have become a great admirer of most of Mr. Sweet's work.  Through Altered  Beast, he delivers us a non-stop barrage of superb rock songs, ranging from  the dark &quot;Devil with the Green Eyes&quot; to the philosophical  &quot;Reaching Out&quot; and &quot;Falling,&quot;  to the lighter  &quot;Time Capsule.&quot;  And then there is  &quot;Knowing People,&quot; a  sarcastic anthem of anti-socialism that is either funny or easy to  indentify with or both, depending on your perspective.  Guitarists Richard  Lloyd, Robert Quine, and Ivan Julian lend their talents to combine with  Sweet's instrumental playing and usual excellent vocals.  Much of the lead  guitar on this album reminded me of the late, great Jimi Hendrix, God rest  his soul.  My feelings toward this album can be summed up by saying simply  that Altered Beast is a work of genius. So why was it not a commercial  success?  Well, for one thing the overall feel of the album is a bit dark,  especially on &quot;Devil with the Green Eyes&quot; and &quot;Someone to  Pull the Trigger.&quot;  It does not appeal to the mainstream listeners,  but those who are willing to give something different a chance should not  be put off.  In Altered Beast, Mathew Sweet shows that he can explore the  bleaker side of human existance without degenrating into a collection of  whining ramblings designed mainly to sell records (no need to name names),  resulting in all album with a wonderful raw quality to it, both in the  intrumentals and the nature of the words.  The fact this album is not  generally appreciated, or even well known, is truely sad. Altered Beast is the best of Matthew Sweet's body of work.  This album deserves to be remastered.  Why, oh why has that not happened?!?! O.K. here's the deal, I don't know how many people I turned on to Girlfriend when it came out, but it mushroomed into a lot of people. Everybody loved the same thing: the awesome coupling of a great pop hook  with psycho guitar work. I guess it simply came down to the quality of the  songwriting, but it also seemed &quot;seminal&quot; at the time, and still  does. This, however, is a different animal altogether, and it's all the  more better for it. Altered Beast is a complete work, best enjoyed as a  whole than divided up into pieces. Themes revolve around &quot;Faith&quot;  and one's perception of one's self in the world. Musically, it's brutal  when it needs to be, and gentle when it needs to be. Plus, the last 7  tracks are absolutely essential, and how many discs can you say that about?  And most people are still wishing for a redux of Girlfriend...... Matthew Sweet falls from the pinnacle of ""Girlfriend"" with this album. The album open with the noisy, absolutely unlistenable ""Dinosaur Act"" leaving me questioning why it was even put on the album. Two (or three) songs are as spectacular, good as those on ""Girlfriend"", ""Time Capsule"", and ""Ugly Truth"", a song so good he includes it in a second country rock version.He runs a witty quote from Caligula wherein Caligula (and presumably Matthew Sweet) announces to the Roman Senate that he's now a God!Unfortunately the rest of the album is good but uneven, there is also ""Devil with the Green Eyes"". But even if this isn't ""Girlfriend"", Matthew Sweet is better than 95% of the Rockers out there.Rock isn't dead but it's certainly moribund, dying from rap, drugs, and perfomers with a lack of talent and discipline. Rock sales have plummeted. But anyone COULD make a good album anytime they wanted to really put themselves into it.  Matthew Sweet is one of the last of a dying breed with this talent and discipline. First off, I have to say that this CD figures prominently in the soundtrack of my life.  Each song contained here has helped me through so many tough times it is most deserving of a review.I got this CD when it came out way back in the day after reading a mixed review of 'Altered Beast'.  The way the reviewer described it as a dark, multifaceted and moody piece; I just couldn't stay away.This CD is a rollercoaster of emotion that will leave you exhausted at the end of it.  Many different textures and moods are displayed throughout the course of this album.I was particularly stunned by the musicianship shown here.  The songs are written very well, with excellent skill shown on each instrument.  Robert Quine and Richard Lloyd both play lead guitar here, and do one heck of a job.  Their solos are very non-traditional to the point of being a breath of fresh air.  Throughtout the songs they let their skills wander over the track, yet show restraint by not playing where the song does not permit.  With Matthew Sweet on the vocals and playing bass and rhythm guitar on most songs, he provides a solid centre for the songs that he's written.  There are so many complex and interesting layers to each song that interact with each other in different ways.Dinosaur Act is one of 'angrier' songs here.  It is a mid-tempo tune that opens up with Sweet extracting wierd dinosaur-like sounds out of a guitar.Devil With The Green Eyes is an excellent song with an arpeggiated rhythm guitar combined with some lap steel guitar forming the basis of the song.  Matt's harmonized vocals in the choruses are hauntingly lovely.The Ugly Truth is a country-twanged song due mainly to the prominent fiddle.  This one features more harmonized vocals... very cool.  This song was a single?  Not worthy of that in my mind.Time Capsule... another single.  This one is more deserving of that status.  There are some excellent plays with vocals overlapping each other in this song.Someone To Pull The Trigger is a wonderfully depressing little ditty.  Matt's fragile vocals get the point across.Knowing People's chorus should be my personal anthem.  This song features some extremely cool lead guitar.  At one point Richard Lloyd even makes a noise come from the guitar that sounds like a piece of glass breaking and then a bunch of tin cans falling on the floor!  (Does this guy know Jimi Hendrix?)  The rest of the song is another midtempo rocking tune.Life Without You is a yearning tune that, with the lyrics that you hear, would expect to be a slower song.  The song clocks in at 2:18, but this one could have easily been dragged out to about 4-5 minutes.The intro to Ugly Truth Rock features a snippet of the movie Caligula with Malcolm McDowell of A Clockwork Orange fame.Ugly Truth Rock is a faster and more rockin' version of The Ugly Truth minus the annoying fiddle playing (it is replaced with lead guitar).Do It Again is a song about emotional warfare within relationships.  It features some clean guitar and an awesome solo.In Too Deep is a dark and evil sounding song.  Some heavy, distorted (compared to the rest of the CD) guitar features prominently as well as some interesting leads.  Another of the angrier songs on this CD... one of my favorites.Reaching Out is a melancholy tune that features Mick Fleetwood (Fleetwood Mac) playing the drums.  Very laid back, yet desparate.  Another favorite.Falling is one of my favorites as well.  If you could summarize this song into two words, they would be 'Lost Hope'.  The solo here smokes and Matt's vocals provide the rain that are trying to put out the fire of the lead guitar.What Do You Know struck a real chord with me.  Having been betrayed in the past, the lyrics really say what you are thinking when a partner has went behind your back with someone else.  The music fits the lyrics somehow, but in a strange way.Evergreen ends off this emotionally complex and draining CD on a surprisingly somewhat positive note.  The music and vocals are very sombre but the lyrics themselves provide a hint of optimism.  A beautiful song.This is some great rainy day music to accompany any melancholy mood.  This is one of the very few CD's I can listen to over and over again back to back.  Matthew Sweet is one of the most accomplished yet underrated songwriters I have ever listened to.  Altered Beast is proof. Matthew Sweet had a sleeper hit in the form of Girlfriend and he followed it up with this a dark power pop album that wore its misery openly and challenged its listeners where Girlfriend didn't....but this is as good an album. Its also one of those very rare things...an album better in its second half than its first (discuss).It starts with a swagger and a howl of feedback that leads into the drums and riff of Dinosaur Act, here you feel a man baring his demons. Guitars keen about and yet there is melody here amongst the chaos. This leads into Devil With The Green Eyes a country number almost that is dark and yet beautiful. This could easily be on Girlfriend but the lyrics are darker...yet we haven't hit the dark centre of this album yet. Ugly Truth is another country tinged number that could have been on Girlfriend. Multi layered harmonies and guitars give the sweet edge to the harsh lyrics. This is a song so good its repeated later on with a more rocky version (Ugly Truth Rock). Time Capsule is the break from the darkness, a brief respite in terms of lyrical content...almost. But then we hit the bottom. Written at the same time as much of Girlfriend the dark Someone To Pull The Trigger is a heartbreaking ballad that tells of a heartbroken man that just wants to end it all. The line 'And everything I'll be I've been' haunts as this pared down number plods its downbeat way into your soul. This is torture and yet its something beautiful at the same time. Not a song for when you need to feel good. Life without You picks the mood up, slightly, and plays to the power pop sentiments of earlier numbers. It sounds like throwaway power pop but its extremely well done and haunting.At this point you have to take a breath...this is halfway. An excerpt from Caligula follows and then the rocky Ugly Truth Rock. Do It Again is the sweet side on the face of it. Lyrically not so much. The harmonies here just drive us further towards another maelstrom of darkness which starts with the boding In Too Deep which has a jam like feel to it and a vocal delivery that sounds bitter in the verse and sweet in choruses but always lyrically dark and it ends in a howl as Sweet repeatedly bemoans how he is dying from desire. Can it get darker? Yes...of course as the next two tracks perfectly show. Reaching out quietly uses its hushed vocal melodies, piano and guitar to deliver a moody and longing ballad. Lyrically this is almost as dark as Someone To Pull The Trigger, when it breaks down Sweet delivers the following lyrics amongst a backing melody as harmonious as anything else on show here'And if I can't know youAll my dreams are throughEvery waking hour is filled with leadI'm dead'Not the most uplifting number and yet it doesn't stop there....Falling comes next and deliver a tale of a relationship going bad. Sweet sings, 'Everyday takes something away, Until there's nothing left to say,No single word can deliver you love' over squealing guitars yet its still harmonious and almost precious in its delivery. With the end of the album in sight Sweet decides to lift the mood slightly with What Do You Know. Another country twinged pop number that is lighter in tone, but might be just a little sarcastic at times. Evergreen is the closer and with guitar, piano and not much else. Its a ballad again and its probably the one time its a truly heartfelt and not bitter moment. The darkness has given away to hope.Its not often I mention every track in a review...but over the years I have come to love each one and appreciate the darkness that Sweet delivered here. Yet, its very much a pop album with catchy hooks and great and memorable numbers.Matthew Sweet may not have had the commercial success here that he did with Girlfriend but that isn't a reflection of the content. In my opinion this is an album that delivers more. Its a darker and more mature effort and it really does make you feel for the man who wrote such dark lyrics which are the counterpoint of amazingly beautiful pop numbers. This was it.  I've heard many Matthew Sweet fans say this is the best album of all time.  A lot of people would laugh at that statement, let them.  Matthew took a big risk with this LP just after departing from Girlfriend fame.  It may not have sold like Girlfriend but the songwriting is brilliant and it holds true 15 years after it's release. Although Matthew was not alone on this record, Fred Maher did an amazing job in production and with musicians like Mick Fleetwood, Nicky Hopkins, Richard Lloyd, Robert Quine and Ivan Julian no wonder this is the album most die hard Sweet fans fell in love with.  The B-sides that went along with this album we supurb as well, too bad there wasn't room for songs like Speed Of Light, Ultrasuede, Thing, Born In Sin or Swan Song on this album.  If you're just discovering Matthew Sweet I'd recommend to buy some of his other albums first though. Just when you think you've figured how his melodic pop structured songs play out, pop in Altered Beast and prepare for an arena rockish, country twang, depression riddled consumption of pure ecstacy. I don't know what happened to Matthew sweet when he made this cd, it is heavy metal compared to his early work like inside.I've kind of always hade the belief that there was some very strong motivation that pushed sweet to make AB. This cd is surely not his alone. Like many I discovered Sweet by way of Girlfriend, this cd blows that one away. I still like his more recent work too, but I find myself really listening to Altered beast much more closely.This is not a cd that would give an artist commercial success, but I hoped it would put Sweet up there in terms of what people would consider brilliant songwriting.I tell people about this cd all the time but because most people don't know or remember sweet they just kind of ignore me. Too bad for them. One of my top 5 favorite ever regardless of genre.","Alternative Rock,Power Pop,Pop,Rock",girlfriend great plenty catchy tunes nice guitar work insightful lyrics better dont like falling much beyond masterful hard pressed find varies style much yet still produces excellent kudos matt simply replicating girlfriend instead darker angrier lyrics manic guitar work quine lloyd minds mix perhaps bit sloppy muddled times ever deserved remaster nothing criticize power pop pop good time think even better rocking dinosaur act devil green eyes insane deep moping knowing people someone pull trigger know know pull hippy country vibes know ugly truth time capsule girlfriend great plenty catchy tunes nice guitar work insightful lyrics better falling masterful hard pressed find varies style produces excellent kudos matt simply replicating girlfriend instead lyrics manic guitar work quine lloyd minds mix bit sloppy muddled times deserved remaster criticize power power pop pop pop pop pop good good time time think better rocking dinosaur dinosaur act act green eyes insane deep moping knowing people pull trigger know know pull hippy country vibes know ugly ugly truth truth time time capsule capsule
338,675,B00000099B,"I don't know if &quot;the ground rumbled,&quot; but it was a hell of a show.  I was there, a student at the University of Missouri, Columbia (I don't know where the hell they got that Missouri University thing).Some details for you fans...  The show was organized by MU's student radio station, KCOU, very nearly by accident.  The station already had booked Alex for the annual Springfest, again organized by KCOU, and somebody there said - &quot;Hey, wouldn't it be funny if..&quot; and history was made with a couple of calls to Jody Stephens, Alex, and the Posies.We were outside in a tent, of all things, because the Hearnes Center was booked with, if I remember right, a Bryan Adams concert.  There couldn't have been 200 people in the tent, either.  As always, it was a great performance by the best unknown band in the world.  Alex was in fine form, and was a treat to see during his waking hours, versus some of the darker shows I've seen him do.  And it was the only time I've seen him perform Chris Bell's work, which was nice.Anyway, thought you might like some details from an eyewitness to the show.S. Clayton Moore Denver, Colorado I love Big Star, but can't stomach this album.  Why someone would want to listen to this and not the originals escapes me.  I guess the sound is edgier, more driving, but ultimately you listen to Big Star for the awesome  songs.  Yet, the voices here are so distracting (the Posies are too  mellodramatic, and Chilton can't save the set) it pretty much wrecks it.  Too bad, but I guess they had to prove it could be done. The short-lived Big Star produced some of the most significant hard-edged Pop to date - severe electric rhythms featuring irrepressible melodies. Columbia serves several purposes. Gratifying the appetite of core fans with a nostalgic tribute. Introducing graying Power Poppers to two superb young musicians (from the Posies). And perhaps sharing a bit of Big Star with younger Posies' fans.The air was electrified and the ground rumbled on April 25, 1993, at Missouri University. The fourteen song concert opens with the heavy-handed `In The Street,' and the bitter `Don't Lie To Me.' `In The Street' is a ferocious rocker built on a seven-note bass guitar progression. The opening song sets the tone for the evening: rumbling base guitar, rousing lead and rhythm guitars, and enticing vocal harmonies. `Don't Lie To Me' sounds like a solid brick wall of electric rock moving unstoppable from the stage into the audience. The song doesn't have a quiet second that you can stick your finger into. The poignant `I Am The Cosmos' (adolescent infatuation at its best) sounds as if someone accidentally plugged the toaster into a 220-volt socket - sparks fly. The concert continues with the vigor of an 18-wheel tractor-trailer. Sing-along melodies? You can bet you copy of #1 Record - `The Ballad Of El Goodo' (a rebellious but melodic teenage statement) and `September Gurls' are gorgeous. The concert ends (too soon) with a rousing boogie titled `Slut' (the politically incorrect anti-feminist statement).Columbia includes a share of ""imperfections."" At times the tempo is not quite synchronized, and the harmony vocals are less than ""angelic."" Thank goodness. Columbia is not sanitized like the starched white linen at the Hyatt Regency - this is ""live"" rock. Crude, raunchy, brazen and liberating. Just the way rock is supposed to be. I am the Cosmos is cosmic, just stupendous on this.  I don't think Chilton sang much on it and I don't know how much guitar he plays but this rendition is worth the disc. Perhaps it's a testament to the songwriting of Chilton, Bell, and Hummel, perhaps it's that Chilton and Stephens haven't been retreading these songs in concert for the past 25 years, or maybe it's just the added energy of  the Posies' Ken Stringfellow and Jon Auer, but these renderings of Big  Star's essential canon sound *fresh*.  The performance is at turns sloppy,  inspired, raw, and cohesive.  It doesn't shed new light the way &quot;Big  Star Live&quot; did at the time of its release (mostly because this isn't  the first peek into Chilton &amp; Stephens live sound), but it's certainly  a welcome addition to any Big Star fan's collection.Now what *I* want to  know is where to get tapes of the two missing tracks (shown in a photograph  of the set-list, but missing from the disc): &quot;O My Soul&quot; and  &quot;13&quot; - the latter being my very favorite Chilton composition.  At  less than 45-minutes, there was certainly room on the disc for these two  tracks. The last song is listed as having a running time of 9:51. Not true.  ""S**T"" actually is 3:44 of music followed by 1+ minute of silence. Hard to understand how this was setup. It would be more helpful for purchasers to know about the gap. A T-Rex cover does begin after the ""silence"" and it's not credited on the track listings. Buyer beware! The music is fine but the gap is really an unnecessary distraction. Alex Chilton is great! So the record of today is BIG STAR-COLUMBIA Live at Missouri University and on it there is a cover of SLUT by Todd Rundgren. While far from perfect this particular disc is the best live show available of the reconstituted Big Star.  The live set on Big Star Story box set from the 70's is a better show, but for the modern Big Star the Columbia show is a good choice. I'll keep this brief: Chris Bell couldn't be there, but I'm convinced he really was there for this performance.  I swear you can feel his energy in the recording. The original records are of course iconic, and the available live material from the early 70s is great but sonically limited (by, for example, 2-track machines).  It took a lot of healing and a lot of guts for Chilton to even attempt this, and what I hear when I play this disk is a tight, passionate and loving tribute to the late Chris Bell -- and affirmation that what he put his heart into mattered!  This record is a lasting gift from the re-formed band to the music community, to each other, and mainly to the fans who have made the ironically named ""Big Star"" into the big stars they never were in their time.  (PS:  Great choice of cover material from T-Rex and Todd Rundgren, kindred spirits who often combined mythology and melody into 3-1/2 minute radio symphonies.) ...and so was I. Last encore number is not included on the disc (""Duke of Earl""). There was a ferris wheel....even Chilton eventually cracked a smile Of the many live shows I've seen and heard over the years, this is one of the best.  Every song crackles with energy.  Alex Chilton and Jon Auer's guitar sounds are a gorgeous mixture of guitar sounds.Many of the classic Big Star songs are well represented here: In The Street, Ballad of El Goodo, Back of a Car and September Gurls all sound fantastic and not at all dated.  The band even gives a fitting tribute to the late Chris Bell, covering I Am The Cosmos, a song that fits seamlessly with the others.  Covers of T. Rex's ""Baby Strange"" and Todd Rundgren's ""Slut"" in particular highlight the band's considerable live chops.Don't get me wrong, I fully respect the original Big Star lineup with Bell and Andy Hummel, but without a doubt the addition of Posies Auer and Ken Stringfellow adds sufficient muscle to the performance. Alex Chilton's vocals are as good now as they were then and Jody Stephens is a highly underrated drummer.Don't hesitate to buy this album. Almost any fan of rock music - from Neil Young to Teenage Fanclub will love this album. I was pretty disappointed with this CD. The band sounded really sloppy and much of the show drags. However, that could be blamed on lack of preparation because this was a reunion concert. They seem to be striving for a Badfinger/Wings sound but fall far short of their lofty goals. The two most memorable songs here are both covers...Marc Bolan's ""Baby Strange"" and Todd Rundgren's ""Slut"". That's a pretty good indicator of how weak their own material is.I have yet to get the whole Big Star mystique. I saw them last year at Little Steven's Garage Fest and they were one of the very few low points. My son felt exactly the same way.","Alternative Rock,Proto Punk,Pop,Power Pop,Rock,Hardcore & Punk",dont know quot ground rumbled quot hell show student university missouri columbia dont know hell got missouri university thing details fans show organized mus student radio station kcou nearly accident station already booked alex annual springfest organized kcou somebody said quot hey wouldnt funny quot history made couple calls jody stephens alex posies outside tent things hearnes center booked remember right bryan adams concert couldnt people tent either always great performance best unknown band world alex fine form treat see waking hours versus darker shows ive seen time ive seen perform chris bells work nice anyway thought know quot ground rumbled hell show student university university missouri columbia know hell got missouri university university details fans show organized mus student student radio student radio station radio radio station station kcou nearly accident station booked annual springfest organized kcou somebody said quot hey funny quot history couple calls jody jody stephens posies tent things hearnes center center booked remember right bryan adams concert people tent great performance best unknown band world fine form treat see waking hours shows seen time seen perform chris bells bells work nice thought
339,677,B00000099K,"Okay, if you got to this page then you obviously have at least some interest in Sonny Landreth.  Here are four easy steps to follow: (1) Ignore the 'Editorial Reviews' drivel about his weaknesses (2) Listen to the sample of &quot;Native Stepson&quot; (3) Listen to the sample of &quot;C'Est Chaud&quot; (4) Quit wasting time, and order this album.I first heard &quot;South of I-10&quot; in late 1994 (about a month before its January '95 release) when I happened on a pre-release review copy.  I had heard of Sonny Landreth a few times before, notably on John Hiatt's &quot;Slow Turning&quot; and Kenny Loggins' &quot;Outside:From the Redwoods&quot;.  None of that admirable session work prepared me for what I heard on this album.  There are plenty of good slide guitarists in the world, and there are lots of good Cajun musicians, but nobody puts those two things together like Sonny Landreth does.I defy you to get through the first three tracks of this album without becoming a Sonny Landreth fan.  The songs are well written, and fire the imagination from the first notes.  As a guitarist, Landreth's style is truly unique, and his instrumental breaks overflow with virtuosity and inventiveness.  Slide guitar work suddenly gives way to fabulous picking, and then flows seamlessly back into slide.  By the time you hear the instrumental &quot;Native Stepson&quot; you'll be convinced that the album just can't get any better.  And you'll be wrong.So go back to the four steps listed above, and get to step four right away.  By the time you've heard this album once or twice you'll even be ready for step five: Order Sonny Landreth's newest album, &quot;Levee Town&quot;.  Then you'll be ready for many long arguments with yourself over which album is better. The CD case was shattered when I received it. Poor packing.........could have done a much, much better job of packing it. I learned of Sonny from Slacker radio, thank God.  I've now bought 3 of his CD's, all different, but all simply amazing and entertaining.  As unique as Ry Cooder and as fiery as the come.  There's plenty of blues in his playing and songwriting but his New Orleans influences added in make for a potent mix.  Great, tight rhythm section, too! Get out your road atlas and take a look at Louisiana south of I-10.  I-10 runs through the great city of New Orleans and the state capital of Baton Rouge.  South of there is the land of Cajun and Creole, a land of swamps, bayous and moss hanging thick from trees, and air that is so heavy with humidity that it can be cut with a knife.To hear what it sounds like slip Sonny Landreth's disc South of I-10 into your cd player and prepare.  Shooting for the Moon blasts out at you with a propulsive beat. This powerful song is just the beginning of the extent of Landreth's ability as a singer, songwriter and guitarist.Creole Angel jumps out at you with a zydeco beat.  Mark Knopfler assists on guitar as Sonny sings:Bottle rocket combo got a corner on the crowdUnder her old balcony above a bar calledThe Blat Cat ProwlSets off memories how she laughed every timeI'd break her silence with a piece of my mindWhen Native Son begins, you know this is like nothing you have ever heard before.  This is rollicking riotous music with a zydeco beat.  Native Son is an infectious instrumental which showcases Landreth's unique slide guitar style. You can hear sliding and ringing and when checking the instruments on this song there is only the guitar the bases and the drums.  It sounds like so much more.While there is not a throw-away song on this cd Congo Square is the most commanding.  It is a mesmerizing song from the first note.  Congo Square takes the listener to the heart of voodoo land.  As Landreth says &quot;It might be superstition.&quot; who is going to take a chance.Sonny Landreth is a &quot;musician's musician&quot;, a singer/ songwirter/ guitarist who was born in 1951 and has worked professionally since being hired by zydeco bandleader Clifton Chenier in 1970.  Landreth has a well established career as a sessions guitarist performing with such diverse performers, as John Hiatt, Mark Knopfler, Kenny Loggins, John Mayall, Junior wells, Clarence Gatemouth Brown and  Dolly Parton.  As a solo performer he has come into his own and is producing music that defies classification.As a songwriter Sonny Landreth is serious about developing his art.  He notes that his influences are both southern writers and bluesmen.  He claims William Faulkner as one of his influences along with noted bluesmen, Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton, Skip James and Mississippi John Hurt.Landreth is an incredible talent who produces music like no other artist.  South of I-10 is a wonderful example of the kind of his music.  Take a listen to it, you'll find yourself longing to take a trip south. This may be an early album, but  it's great. This just proves that Sonny has been phenomenal for quite a while. There's a reason Clapton invites him to Crossroads and Frampton had him join the 2013 Guitar Circus. His slide playing is like no other. In concert you'd swear there are two players. Hendrix was the only other player I've heard live that could to that, without effects. His playing is not a copy of anyone else. Bonamassa has lovingly called him a &#34;freak of nature&#34;. This album is a good one to start with. Check out &#34;Mojo Boogie&#34;, &#34;C'est Chaud&#34; and especially &#34;Native Stepson&#34;. With this release Sonny LANDRETH has reached his musical zenith.  Listening to this cd, one can sense the geography, smells, and zest for life evident in our great southeast.  The music stands on it's own merit and the lyrics flow like prose poems. For both the un-initiated or the long-time fan this cd offers either the joy of discovery or the warmth of a mature relationship. As an aside, Sonny is even more joyful in a live setting.  I was fortunate to see Sonny open for the great Buddy Guy and when Sonny's too-short set was complete the packed house initially sat in awed silence, then burst into prolonged applause that even the most &quot;toured&quot; artist would have appreciated. So give  South of I-10 a chance, give it a listen, and be prepared to have your musical life changed forever.  Thanks for the space,  DARRYL W. SIEGERS I can't even recall how I heard about this artist but his music is very enjoyable. The songs are great. His voice is a less ragged tone than so many blues players who sing out of necessity rather than skill (which somehow just adds to the experience!) so sometimes it's not enough but it's a nice mellow sound and one I can play around a pretty wide berth of assorted friends and family that I know can enjoy it too, and still allow us to carry on a conversation. The album was recommended by my guitar teacher, as a good representation of Sonny Landrith's work. Mark Riley has played with him numerous times(my teacher). Anyway, I have found the album very enjoyable and instructive. Okay, let's start with the premise that there is no bad Sonny Landreth music.  This guy has been honing his art since he was about 12, and he only gets better with time, so you will not be wasting your money if you buy this CD by any means.  That said, however, this one isn't going down as my all-time favorite of Sonny's records.  The songsmithing is interesting, but not as well-honed as it becomes by ""The Road We're On.""  The guitar is clean and beautiful, but perhaps not as richly plentiful as it is on later efforts.  It's really fun to hear the early studio version of ""Congo Square,"" and there are some cool tunes on here you won't find anywhere else, including the title track, but if you are just getting into Sonny Landreth, and want to be purely blown away by his genius, start with ""Grant Street,"" then work your way back to this one. An amazing album. Sonny writes deeply personal songs about growing up in Southern Louisiana. His guitar playing is brilliant and his songs have the amazing ability to transport you to the dancehalls and bayous of his home state. The ultimate album from the King of Slideco. I really like this album & am impressed with Sonny's guitar work as well as his voice. I play it as often as I do Joe Bonamassa or Warren Haynes. Sonny Landreth is amazing.  I have seen him twice and love his music.  He is one of the best artists around. You'll want 'em all. &quot;Shootin for the Moon&quot; starts it off with a little vocal assistance from none other than Mark Knopfler.  (He sits in with Sonny on Creole Angel...) I just witnessed Sonny perform in Fort Smith, He encored with &quot;Congo Square&quot; and we were screaming &quot;Don't go, Sonny!!! Please don't go!!!&quot; He is even better live (if that is possible) than on the CD. What a band too! EXCELLENT 3-Piece band. He ends the CD with a spiritual beauty of a song &quot;Great Gulf Wind&quot;... Being a Southerner and having lived in South Louisiana, I can identify with many of the lyrics. If you haven't... his music will take you there. Simply AWESOME 10+++++++!!!!! I was listening to the radio one day and this was a rare occasion where the radio host actually told the name of the song and named the artist playing the song instead of running his mouth about himself.  I went to the store and bought it and have been a fan since then.  Sonny Landreth should be in every serious Cajun, Rock, Swamp music fans CD collection. This CD, in my opinion has diversity, showcases Sonny's talent on the guitar and slide, and his vocals.  He definitely has a musical style all his own. This CD introduced me to""Sonny Landreth's Style"" and I'm impressed with his songwriting ability as well. Maybe everyone won't agree but I believe he is an undiscovered ""Great"". This release, along with Levee Town, are essential in the Sonny Landreth catalogue. This guy is so talented - that is why John Hiatt had him in his band. Highly recommended! It was nice to discover a really great slide tone and play from someone who grew up in the the home this wonderful music. It was a nice cross between tradition and modern style. Worth picking up if you haven't already. This CD is one of Sonny Landreth's better works - there isn't a loser song on the disk!He's on his game and this disk is a great exhibit to make the argument that Sonny L is one of the best - if not the best slide masters ever. Some great songs on this cd. Well recorded and as always, anything Sonny does is loaded with his awesome talent on the guitar. Slide guitar heaven. Great songs. Blues - Rock music dosen't get much better than this boys. This is a masterpiece. If you don't like this, you should stop listening to music. I don't know why everyone (but me), is giving this album 5 stars.  There's a lot of junk on the CD.  Tracks 4,6,8,11 and the hidden track 12 have no energy and very little guitar.Try The Road We're On instead. The Music Gods have been very generous in sending us Sonny Landreth.  This is the album that really puts Sonny on the map.  Recorded back in 1995, guests such as Mark Knopfler (he shares lead guitar duties with Sonny on the masterpiece ""Congo Square"") appear throughout the album.  If you love slide guitar, your collection is not complete if don't have Sonny's work.  This album is an excellent place to start your collection, because once you hear Sonny, you are going to want to get everything he's ever done.//Alaska Scott Just cue up and listen to &#34; Shootin for the Moon&#34;.Sonny brings the unique feeling of his part of thecountry right to you. Very hot guitar and a touch ofthat Louisiana voice. One of the best slide playersaround with a style all his on. If he ever comes to yourtown, catch his show.  you will love it ! Many Landreth fans regard this album as his masterpiece and I would tend to agree with that assessment.  It is, at the least, his best album in my opinion.  The songwriting is all solid and Landreth's guitar has never sounded better.  A lot of people quibble over his voice, but again I find that it pretty much fits the music to a T here.  The album seems to have a theme telling stories of Landreth's youth in the bayous of Louisiana.  Songs like ""Creole Angel"", ""Native Stepson"", ""Cajun Waltz"", ""Mojo Boogie"", ""C'est Chaud"", and ""Great Gulf Wind"" leave no doubt as to where he came from.  I pretty much like every song on this album.  The title track ""South Of I-10"" tells the story of his early musical career and is one of the best he has ever written.  The rest of the tracks ""Shootin For The Moon"", ""Orphans Of The Motherland"", and ""Turning Wheel"" are all great slide guitar blues rock too.  Landreth even does a cover of one his own early tunes ""Congo Square"".  Mark Knofler and Alain Toussaint guest on the track as it serves as a nice update of the original.  If you are looking to explore Landreth's brand of Louisiana blues rock, this album would be a great place to start. Sonny Landreth is a special musician with a unique style, but he is no blues singer - I always get the feeling his songs would sound so much better with proper vocal treatment.  Check out Charlie Musselwhite's version of 'Shootin' For The Moon' on ""Sanctuary"" .... otherwise, I agree with most of the reviews here. This man has Heart and Soul. I have been a musician for over 30 years and I have NEVER heard Slide Guitar like he plays. I discovered this Album from a promo CD in 1995 while working as manager of a record store.  Now, I love my hard rock and I love my Beatles but when I heard the first opening chords of the CD I knew I was hearing something special. As I listened to the whole thing I have to say a tear came to my eye hearing the chord progressions and the sound of his Guitar and Voice. Don't worry about comparing one of his Albums to another...This Album stands alone. I LOVE this CD.  I listen to it at least once a week (usually more).  Everytime I hear it, I just want to dance and laugh.  What more can you ask of good music???  Get it, put it in the CD player and see if you hear the ""weaknesses"" that the other ""reviewers"" find.","Blues Rock,Pop,Electric Blues,Modern Blues,Rock,Blues",okay got page obviously least interest sonny landreth four easy steps follow ignore editorial reviews drivel weaknesses listen sample quot native stepson quot listen sample quot cest chaud quot quit wasting time order first heard quot south quot late month january release happened pre release review copy heard sonny landreth times notably john hiatts quot slow turning quot kenny loggins quot outside redwoods quot none admirable session work prepared heard plenty good slide guitarists world lots good cajun musicians nobody puts two things together like sonny landreth defy get first three without becoming sonny landreth fan well written fire imagination okay got page obviously interest sonny sonny landreth easy steps follow ignore editorial reviews drivel weaknesses listen sample quot native stepson quot listen sample quot quot quit wasting time order heard quot south late month january release happened release review review copy copy heard sonny landreth times notably quot slow turning quot kenny loggins quot redwoods admirable session work prepared heard plenty good slide slide guitarists guitarists world lots good cajun musicians things sonny landreth defy sonny landreth fan written fire imagination
340,678,B0000009A4,"Love Jones popped up on my radar during the ""lounge scene"" days of the early 90's.  Listening to this album (which I purchased on the release date from a local independent record shoppe) 16 years later, it's a real shame they fell under that classification. Sure, ""Here's to the Losers"" was pretty loungy - but the band brought in some heavy and earnest funk in recording this album.First of all, the sound is tight - it doesn't do it justice to cite individual songs because the album as a whole is just....tight - there's no better word for it.  This ""tightness"" is highlighted by the perfect production of the recording - none of this ""wall of sound"" nonsense - with all the horns and bass it'd have been real easy to blow everything up with loudness, but whoever produced this didn't fall into that trap - the horns, guitar, bass, vocals - everything exists in its own space in this recording, not only can you hear the notes, but you can hear in-between the notes.  I can't think of another record I've listened to in the last 20 years that sounds as sweet as this one.It's a shame for the band that they didn't break out and make it big - but them's the trappings of having your own sound I guess.  I'd have at least expected them to have a life on the college party-band circuit, and maybe they did - they just never made it down to my side of the country.This album will never get old for me, I really think it's a great example of what a well-produced album should sound like. I received this CD from a good friend, and I have yet to take it out of my CD player. It's a fun, rollicking romp of an album with lots of cheeky retro flourishes, tightly mixed and lovingly sung. I really wish they would release another album (or at least play my town sometime!) because they really are a great band with a terrific uncompromising sound. HAVING RECEIVED A COPY OF LOVE JONES FIRST RELEASE &quot;HERE'S TO THE LOSERS&quot;, I LOOKED INTENTLY TOWARDS THEIR NEXT RELEASE. I WAS REWARDED FOR MY PATEINCE WITH A A SMOOTH, HIP AND PLAYFUL EXCURSION IN SOUND. THE TOUNGE IN CHEEK LYRICS AND OUTSTANDING MUSICIANSHIP MAKE THIS ONE A KEEPER.

I am hoping for more releases from this talented band. i really like their sound.  i'm glad they never made it big, otherwise their shows wouldn't be affordable. Me too... :)  Great CD.

It is wonderful just to listen to and also is perfect when used as background (ambient) music while you read, study school lessons, chat with friends, or dine alone or with others. Space Hotel is my newest favorite CD, and I can't wait to add more of Al Gromer Khan's music to my collection! I actually bought this on a whim, knowing nothing about the artist. Sometimes that really works out for me. This is so much more than 'mood music'  or 'white noise'. This is actually beautiful music which I find myself listening to over and over. If you like music that doesn't yell at you or otherwise assault your senses I highly recommend it. I only have one album by Al Gromer Khan and that led me to tasting this particular recording.The fluid, tranquil sounds were just what I was looking for and the Eastern flavor of the instruments supported that completely.Even the vocal additions blend well with the overall mood.  A great, new set of tunes for my quiet moments. I have always been impressed with Al Gromer Kahn's music on Hearts of Space programs, so when I heard cuts of this , I decided I would like to have it around!  Love it!

342,684,B0000009FE,"People have been commenting on the quality of the actual recording when they listen to this CD, and I can understand the negative feedback.  On tracks 1 (Miyake) and 5 (Hae), there are sections where volume needs to be  adjusted to hear practically anything above a whisper.  It does detract  from the overall enjoyment to fiddle with the volume knob, but aside from  that, it's got a good acoustical feel to it.  Miyake has a traditional  song just before it, and the harmony of the voices really adds a great  touch.  Monochrome is on a few other CD's; it's not the easiest thing to  listen to - it's a long piece and best served as a blend of visual/audial.  The Odaiko piece is powerful - but then again, it always is...  Chonlima is  a personal favorite, and this time it's played fast, on the edge of  amazingly so.  Hae is only on this album, but it's got a soothing, relaxed  feel even through the build at the end.  I'd recommend this for  Kodo/Taiko fans, but not for first-time buyers or just the curious.  You'll  like it better if you know what you're in for. percussive masterwork of the highest order. If you like this one and want to hear some of this sound integrated into a rockin' pop sense, check out Hai, by The Creatures. The two works complement each other quite well! The CD liner contains the following notice: &quot;This disc contains music of extraordinarily wide dynamic range, encompassing long passages at the threshold of audibility that build to levels of extreme intensity.&quot;  This caution must have been intended to address the pitiful engineering of  this CD. The actual dynamic range of the entire CD is remarkably narrow.  Track 5 for example is almost completely inaudible, even at maximum volume.  (My personally &quot;remastered&quot; version of track 5 sounds fine -  after 980% amplification). I was able to obtain a rare CD of the excellent recording at a reasonable price. I am satisfied.Thank you! I bought this and Best of KODO Vol. 1 for comparison.  This recording is simply magical.  It's amazing.  I listen with Conrad Johnson tube amps and KEF 107/2 speakers.  I think those who found this recording very annoying or ""poor"" did not have the proper equipment to take advantage of the engineering that went into this disc.  This is not background music.  You really need to sit down and liten to this disc to take it all in.  Yes, has fewer tracks than most CD's BUT they are alive! The complaints about the technical quality of this recording are off-base.  It was originally made during the analog era as a ""direct to disk"" recording.  This means that it was recorded live onto vinyl (not tape) without compression or limiting.  This provides an enormous dynamic range (difference between softest and loudest peaks) that will, if done correctly, reflect what the music sounds like in a live environment.  It also requires leaving substantial ""headroom"" - i.e., not recording at too loud a level, in order to avoid distorition in loud passages.  The dynamic range on the CD version is anything but limited - there are easily 60db jumps from quiet to loud passages.  As one reviewer points out, the soft passages - perhaps unusual to western ears - do reflect the actual performance experience.  As a second reviewer points out, the virtues of the recording are best appreciated with very high quality playback equipment.  Much music today is highly compressed - the difference between loud and soft passages evened out to provide ""punch"".  Compression also changes the way the music sounds and destroys nuance ([...]).  The reviewer who increased sound levels by 980% probably did so through ""normalization"" - a type of compression.  I'll take the original ""pitiful"" engineering on this disc (carried out by Doug Sax, probably the most renowned pressing engineer in the business) any day.","Far East & Asia,Instructional,Special Interest,Pop,Traditional Folk,World Music,Japan,Folk",people commenting quality actual recording listen cd understand negative feedback miyake hae sections volume needs adjusted hear practically anything whisper detract overall enjoyment fiddle volume knob aside got good acoustical feel miyake traditional harmony voices really adds great touch monochrome cds easiest thing listen long piece best served blend visual audial odaiko piece powerful always chonlima personal favorite time played fast edge amazingly hae got soothing relaxed feel even build end id recommend kodo taiko fans first time buyers curious youll like better know youre people commenting quality actual recording listen cd understand negative negative feedback feedback miyake hae sections volume needs adjusted hear practically overall enjoyment fiddle volume volume knob knob aside got good acoustical feel miyake traditional harmony voices really adds great touch monochrome cds listen long piece best served blend visual audial odaiko piece powerful personal favorite time played fast edge amazingly got soothing relaxed feel build end recommend kodo taiko fans first time buyers time buyers curious better know youre
343,686,B0000009G1,"The Penguins were one of my favorite groups when I was growing up. To this day, their songs are still great. My favorite of their songs is &#34;Earth Angel.&#34; The Penguins may not be the most professional or technically perfect group, but the members of it are lovable in spite of falling short of greatness or ability to make big money.  They are as good as any group for illustrating all the 1950s-era background doowops, oh-oh-ohs, wo-wo-wos and mimicking of the lead singer's lyrics.  At times, their imperfections make them seem as if they are doing parodies of 1950s music.  They also can provoke laughter, as when the lead singer uses a room-shaking excessively intense vibrato (tracks 7 and 19) or the group tackles an out of character traditional country music song (track 11).  The group's efforts are of historical interest, since its members struggled mightily to get a big hit, reached the top of the music world with ""Earth Angel,"" failed to get royalties for creating it, then failed to get another big hit.  Critical students of recorded music may criticize details of what they hear, but the sound quality is good enough to allow listeners to enjoy, admire and chuckle about The Penguins.  ""Earth Angels"" on track 1 is fabulous! This song was a favorite of my husband's and mine in the 1950's.  He has now passed away and I wanted to have it in my collection.  I heard it on a jukebox in the Silver Diner the other day and it sounded much better than what I just heard. I bought the CD for the simple desire to have a copy of ""Earth Angel.""  Beyond that two, maybe three other tracks are something I'd listen to more than once.  For my tastes the Penguins are a one hit wonder. I was disappointed by the poor mono sound quality of this ,obviously, non-remastered CD.The songs are fabulous and fairly represent their vast resume` of great tunes.I only wish this were  recorded in a digitally remastered fashion.","Oldies,Pop,R&B,Doo Wop,Rock,Oldies & Retro",penguins one favorite groups growing day still great favorite earth angel penguins may professional technically perfect group members lovable spite falling short greatness ability make big money good group illustrating era background doowops oh oh ohs wo wo wos mimicking lead singers lyrics times imperfections make seem parodies also provoke laughter lead singer uses room shaking excessively intense vibrato group tackles character traditional country groups efforts historical interest since members struggled mightily get big hit reached top world earth angel failed get royalties creating failed get another big hit critical students recorded penguins favorite groups growing day great favorite earth earth angel angel penguins professional technically perfect perfect group group members lovable spite falling falling short short greatness ability big money money good group illustrating era background doowops mimicking lead lead singers singers lyrics times imperfections seem parodies provoke laughter lead lead singer singer room shaking excessively intense vibrato group tackles character traditional country groups efforts historical interest members struggled mightily hit reached world earth earth angel angel failed royalties creating failed hit critical students recorded
344,688,B0000009H2,"With a heart full of soul and a left hand that would make Professor Longhair proud, Jon Cleary brings the essense of New Orleans piano to life in this outing.Cleary has obviously done his homework as he opens with &quot;Go ahead baby&quot; and from here he never lets up.A transplanted Englishman, he has more than adopted the blues, he's living them.Every now and then an artist comes along that really understands the genre he or she chooses to work in. We saw that with the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan. What Stevie did for Texas blues and the guitar, Jon Cleary does for New Orleans piano.I have not heard this much feeling and groove since James Booker.Other standout cuts include the soulful&quot;In the Mood&quot;, the classic Professor Longhair cover,&quot;Big Chief&quot; and the gospel tinged,&quot; Pick up the pieces&quot;. The only reason I would give this release 4 stars instead of 5 is that he can only get better.Otherthan that, it's a must for any aspiring blues pianist. Kinda like the way Bluesbreakers is for guitarists. Or even if you're just a lover of great blues,jazz and soul, this may just be what the doctor ordered.Finally, in case you're wondering, his live show is just as good,as he picks from cuts off of Alligator Lips and Dirty Rice to his latest release, Moonburn with a few suprises thrown in.It should be a crime to be this talented! OK. Sorry for the intentionally mangled phrasing on the review title. Jon Cleary smokes the ivories, and this is a fabulous CD. If I were inclined to argue, I might take a *slight* issue with another reviewer's position that this version of ""Big Chief"" is better than Professor Longhair's. Some would call such a claim heresy. I'm only going to say, Wow. This version is fantastic and probably arranged better than anything on the Professor's (much older) albums. (OK. Maybe it IS better.) And the Cleary original ""C'Mon Second Line"" blows the roof off. Yes, it's rather a slim volume for the dollar. But it kicks funky butt, and is a worthy addition to anybody's New Orleans collection. If you love great New Orleans R&B you will love Jon Cleary.  I purchased his JC and The Absolute Monster Gentlemen album and loved it.  I had to have more so this one was next.  This one has more of a New Orleans feel to it but is just as great.  Great funkyness and second line grooves.  Buy this and everything you can from Jon Cleary. I recently bought Alligator Lips & Dirty Rice by Jon Cleary and 100000000 Bon Jovi Fans Cant be Wrong by obviously, Bon Jovi. As these were a present for a friend, i bought & paid for the option of gift wrapping. Lo & behold they turned up butt naked, so to speak. I was never going to be able to time it so they turned up at my friends place exactly on her birthday, so the gift wrapping was important for her to be able to save the gifts for then. Needless to say this wasn't good enough & i'm extremely disappointed.Alligator Lips & Dirty Rice100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong ""British born Jon Cleary is a triple threat-with a salty-sweet voice, masterful piano skills,and a knack for coupling infectious grooves with melodic hooks and sharp lyrics.""- from the Bonnie Raitt websiteJon Cleary's name appears in the credits of close to 100 Blues albums from the past 25 years, not least of which is backing up Bonnie Raitt on keyboards and vocals. But the music that Cleary plays on his own recordings is not strictly Blues, it is an infectious and funky combination of real New Orleans groove music with infusions of R & B, Soul, Blues, Jazz and Cleary's own original songwriting.This first recording of his as a leader has been out of print for a while, so it's wonderful that this gem is available once more.Cleary is backed by some of New Orleans' finest on this 1989 recordingincluding George Porter Jr.(the Meters) on bass and backing vocals, Willie Singleton on trumpet, Mike Ward on percussion, Bunchie Johnson on drums and backing vocals, and Doc Paulin on trombone.Jon Cleary plays some mean boogie woogie piano on this recording, recalling the style of Professor Longhair. Some of Cleary's melodies also remind one of Dr. John and Stevie Wonder's music. But Cleary is no imitator or impersonator, he has made all these influences and styles his own, these are just the tools he uses to play his very joyful music for us.I highly recommend this album to anyone who wants to get a start in Cleary's world, and also to those who prefer the more traditional blues and soul styles of New Orleans music. His later recordings with his band ""the Absolute Monster Gentlemen"" go into funkier and more fusion oriented rock/jazz/soulterritory. I love all of his recordings, they are very infectious, but this album is probably the best place to start. Jon cleary is incredibleThis is my favorite album.No one but dr john plays piano like he does.great songs on this album This is one of the best (albeit short) albums on the planet.  It'll leave you wanting more -- so get Moonburn, too.Jon does a version of &quot;Big Chief&quot; that's better than any Professor Longhair version I've ever heard (and I've probably heard most of them).It's hard to pick a favorite, but &quot;Go Ahead Baby&quot;, written by Cleary, is flawless.  I don't think there's a girl anywhere who wouldn't love a guy who says &quot;Anything you want, you just let me know baby&quot;.  It's raunchy in such a charming way, with one of the best lyrics -- &quot;I'm just waiting for a girl like you.  She likes to do what you think of, don't like to think what you do&quot;.&quot;Burnt Mouth Boogie&quot; --  You've never heard fingers fly so fast over a keyboard and sound so effortless.All I can say is thank God for CDs, because if this album were on vinyl, I'd be on my third or fourth one by now.  You WON'T be selling this one to the second-hand CD shop. had a hard time finding this cd but well worth the trouble, I have not heard his new cd so can't compare the two.","Contemporary Blues,R&B,Blues,Pop",heart full soul left hand would make professor longhair proud jon cleary brings essense new orleans piano life outing cleary obviously done homework opens quot go ahead baby quot never lets transplanted englishman adopted blues hes living every artist comes along really understands genre chooses work saw late great stevie ray vaughan stevie texas blues guitar jon cleary new orleans piano heard much feeling groove since james booker standout cuts include soulful quot mood quot classic professor longhair cover quot big chief quot gospel tinged quot pick pieces quot reason would give release stars instead get better otherthan must aspiring blues pianist kinda like way bluesbreakers heart full soul left hand professor professor longhair longhair proud jon cleary cleary brings new new orleans new orleans piano orleans piano life obviously homework opens go ahead ahead baby quot lets transplanted englishman adopted blues living artist comes comes along really understands genre chooses work saw late great stevie stevie ray stevie ray vaughan ray vaughan stevie texas blues blues blues guitar guitar jon cleary new new orleans new orleans piano orleans piano heard feeling groove james james booker standout cuts include soulful quot mood classic professor professor longhair longhair cover quot chief quot gospel tinged pick pieces reason release stars instead get better better aspiring blues blues pianist pianist kinda way
345,689,B0000009HW,"I was not familiar with the brothers but I sure am now. Duet country music like thi is almost extinct, a real shame. Beyond my expectations!  I love this CD.  I am going to purchase the Classic Cuts box set next.  If it's as good as this CD, I will be very happy.  This is good old time music. I love their music, the vocal harmony and especially the harmonica and pickin!  There are several train songs on the CD which I love most of all.  Pan American Boogie is the best rendition I can recall of this classic song. Wayne Rainey and the Delmore Brothers are two of my favorite artists. This CD is an excellent example of their work. Also like the tribute to the Demore  Brothers by the Lovin Brothers. As a collector of this type of  music, I highly recommend this CD. The Delmore brothers are one of those names that you no longer hear.  And that's a real shame.  Not only were they the frist true ""power"" duet, but introduced the world to the finest musicians ever to grace the music world, including none other than Merle Travis and Wayne Raney.  The 20 songs contained here are not your usual traditional country....in fact, at the time of their recordings, the Delmore Bros could probably be better characterized as Rock and Roll (had it been ""invented"" at the time!) or Bop.  This album is well worth your money, and definately, worth a listen. Ace Records should be given a big pat on the back for releasing these Delmore Brothers classics cut for King Records between 1946 - 1952 . If you like bluesy , hillbilly , country boogie in its rawest form , this cd is a must . Fantastic vocal harmonies , great blues harp , great guitar picking and twenty tracks that are the equal to anything that you will find in American Roots music . These recordings are as earthy as the soil of the Elkmont farm that the brothers grew up on , and so influential in that they played a major part in laying down the blueprint for the Rock&Roll that was to change the 20th Century for ever . I can't think of higher praise than that ! What a superb album.  Taken from the Brothers' years with Cincinnati based King Records (1945 - 1952), the album features classics such as 'Blues Stay Away From Me', with its highly distinctive guitar work, and my own  favorite, 'Hillbilly Blues', as well as the title track.  The album is a  nice mixture of blues and boogie-woogie, with the Brothers' sweet harmonies  backed up by some great musicians.  Apart from Wayne Raney's superb  harmonica, check out Zeke Turner's electric guitar work on 'Boogie Woogie  Baby'.  And is that Merle Travis backing up on 'Hillbilly Blues'?  And then  there's Roy Lanham's electric guitar on 'Peach Tree Street Boogie'.  But  every track on this album has something to commend it.  So don't mess  around.  Buy it!  You won't regret it. The best country music may still be yet to come, but until it gets here  this is the best stuff you can get. Several years ago The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website included a list entitled 500 Songs That Shaped Rock And Roll.  The Delmore Brothers' &quot;Hillbilly Boogie&quot; made that list.  After picking up this CD it's easy to see why.  Though they were a country act, they incorporated blues, boogie and rockabilly elements into their sound. Rabon and Alton Delmore recorded for King from 1946 until 1952, when Rabon died of lung cancer.  [Alton died in 1964.]  The twenty tracks included here (half of which are originals) provide a terrific overview of two musicians who--as the liner notes point out--&quot;were too modern for the determined traditionalism of bluegrass, (but) too oldtime for the hip-swivelling of rock 'n' roll.&quot;  Every track is a delight. This is important listening.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED This is like a Jimmie Rogers album or a Robert Johnson Album, or Decca Basie, it is soooooooooo good that when you play it, it stays on the player for days, sometimes weeks.  This is the last part of the Delmore Brother's career. It contains stuff that is typical of their old stuff, but suffused with the new approach to country music that came after World War II.  Probably Arthur Guitar Boogie Smith (as opposed to Fiddlin' Arthur Smith) ushered it in with his Guitar Boogie.  However, the Delmore Brothers here joined by Wayne Rayney, and Jethro Burns (the great electric mandolinist of Homer and Jethro) who ad some great electric guitar playing on a lot of the cuts, get the thing going with great guitar boogie music.there is something sweet and real and at the same time modern--despite the cynicsm of the liner notes that come with the CD that don't understand it--and really working class about it. I keep thinking of the used car blues, and the Sand Mountain Blues. ""I am just a poor boy and work's my middle name.""Like I say, discount the cynicism of the liner notes. Steamboat Bill the last song is a great rhythm tune.It's good to remember that the guitar boogie music along with folks who came this way via a Western Swing direction like Moon Mullican were part of what inspired rockabilly along with rhythm and blues and rock and roll.Rock and Roll begins as a phase of R & B starting around 1950-1953 before any Sun records were made of rockabilly, although in the late 40s there had been a R & B craze of songs on the topic and using the words ""Rock and Roll.""  As for Sun,  one of the first Rock and Roll records, Ike Turner/Jackie Brenson's historic ""Rocket 88,"" (in 1952 or 53 I believe) was recorded by Sun.  Sun began primarily as a blues and R & B operation that sold or leased recordings to national distributors like Chess and King. The young, barely out of high school Ike Turner, functioned like an A & R man for sun bringing some of the greatest blues stars like Howling Wolf into the studios for the first time and cuting some fine records himself. I played this record to a few friends of mine who are really into roots rock 'n' roll and rockabilly and they couldn't believe it that they never heard about the Delmore Brothers and Wayne Raney! This is the music that paved the way for Sun Records and all the new rockabilly styles in the 1950's. There is so much power and energy in this music! It is so good to have this compilation available, it should be in every collection of music lovers, no matter if you are into Country, Blues or Rockabilly/Rock 'N' Roll!","Classic Country,Roadhouse Country,Country,Bluegrass,Pop,Traditional Folk,Today's Country,Jump Blues,Traditional Blues,Old-Time Country,Blues,Folk",familiar brothers sure duet country like thi almost extinct real shame beyond expectations love cd going purchase classic cuts box set next good cd happy good old time love vocal harmony especially harmonica pickin several train cd love pan american boogie best rendition recall classic wayne rainey delmore brothers two favorite artists cd excellent example work also like tribute demore brothers lovin brothers collector type highly recommend cd delmore brothers one names longer hear thats real shame frist true power duet introduced world finest musicians ever grace world including none merle travis familiar brothers sure duet country extinct real shame expectations love cd purchase classic cuts box box set set good cd happy good good old old time love vocal vocal harmony harmony especially harmonica train cd love pan pan american american boogie best rendition recall classic wayne rainey rainey delmore brothers brothers favorite artists cd excellent example work tribute brothers brothers collector type highly recommend cd delmore brothers brothers names longer hear real shame frist true power duet introduced world musicians grace world including merle merle travis

That's not Moon's fault.  I can forget the recording quality very easily. In fact, it's a lot better than others in that time period. A lot of people must have learned from this man, including Bob Wills, Hank Thompson, Willie Nelson, and many others. ""I left my heart in Texas"" is, of course, a Jimmie Rodgers sound, and I believe Jimmie was before Moon, but I don't know who influenced who. ""It's a sin to love you"" is pure Hank Williams, as is Nine Tenths Of The Tennessee River, but Hank never played a piano like that.  Who influenced who?

349,693,B0000009J4,"I loved Paul's three major hits and bought them all as 45's. However, since I never heard any more from him, I naively concluded he had no more to offer. This disc pleasantly dispels that notion and shows that he deserved a better musical fate. If his &quot;Roses Are Red&quot; had been produced in a manner similar to Bobby Vinton's version, one wonders if Paul might have achieved similar success. An enjoyable cd. THis is a wonderfull cd,, filled with refreshing clean 50's music ,,rockabilly style,, a great voice that fits just right with the musci.. I love it. Paul Evans had something going with his collection. Who would ever forget Seven Little Girls, a top song as so with Midnight Special ,Happy Go Lucky Me and Show Folk all classic tracks to turn back the clock to a great time of growing up. Paul Evans is a lesser-known transitional figure from the waning days of rock `n' roll's first pass. His best remembered (and most anthologized) hit single is the 1959 novelty ""(Seven Little Girls) Sitting in the Back Seat,"" which was followed by a cover of ""Midnite Special"" that's equal parts Johnny Rivers and Pat Boone. His last top-40 hit was the 1960 banjo-driven pop novelty ""Happy-Go-Lucky-Me,"" a tune that's turned up in recent years in both film and on television. He worked as a songwriter, writing Bobby Vinton's chart topping ""Roses are Red (My Love),"" and returned to the charts with a couple of middling country entries in 1978 (""Hello, This is Joannie (The Telephone Answering Machine Song"") and 1979 (""Disneyland Daddy"").Ace's 28-track anthology focuses primarily on his work from 1959 and 1960, adding his two later country hits and his previously unissued original of ""Roses Are Red (My Love)."" The latter is a surprisingly close template to Vinton's later hit, though without a few of the finishing touches that converted the song into chart gold. Evans' original has a twangy guitar in place of the hit's Floyd Cramer-styled piano, the backing chorus is more pop than Nashville Sound, and though Evans' vocal is heartbroken, it's not as dramatically so as Vinton's. The bulk of Evans' earlier recordings include easy swinging rockabilly and toned down R&B; covers, produced with guitar, bass, drums, piano and sax.None of the covers measure up to the readily available originals, but unlike the neutered works of Pat Boone, Evans seems to understand what he's singing, even if he can't muster the sort of verve these songs deserve. The backing musicians do a good job, though on tracks like ""60 Minute Man"" the stinging guitar and soulful background singers give way to a lead vocal whose growl is unconvincing. Evans is better off singing songs of lost love, such as the rolling ""After the Hurricane,"" and excels on his clever novelty tracks, which include the march time ""The Brigade of Broken Hearts"" and the country lampoon, ""Willie's Sung With Everyone (But Me).""Evans' cover versions provide a novel view of how artists scrambled to cope with the musical changes wrought by rock `n' roll, but a rocker Evans was not. Neither his voice nor attitude have the grit or abandon of a rock `n' roll singer and though his covers are well intended, they're more cute than convincing. His original work, particularly his pop songs and novelties ring truer to his artistic character. Ace's compilation gives you the chance to hear it all, including his original hit singles from 1959 and 1960, and his later re-emergence on the country chart in the late `70s. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2009 hyperbolium dot com] Paul Evans helped rock'n roll over the bridge and into the mainstream of  American music. When he recorded &quot;Seven Little Girls...&quot; he set  the pace for future artist in novelty music. ACE has taken almost all of  Paul's music and put it in this great package....&quot;Midnight  Special&quot;, &quot;Happy Go Lucky Me&quot; (Used in a 1998 Movie  &quot;PECKER&quot;), The Brigade Of Broken Hearts&quot;, &quot;Hello, This  Is Joannie&quot; and his own composition &quot;Roses Are Red&quot; are all  included and sound great on this package. This package is a musical history  lesson from a man that was (and still is) a great entertainer. I bought this for the song 'SEVEN LITTLE GIRLS....' --- a novelty song that I remembered from my childhood. There is some real good rockabilly on this record as well. Well worthwhile!! I'm surprized that Paul Evans was not a SUPERSTAR in that time period. I bought these records as a teenager and I never realized that 'Hushabye Little Guitar' was not a hit. I also never knew that Paul was from the NYC area. I just thought he was a rockabilly singer from TN or GA. His recording of 'Midnight Special' is still the best. Paul Evans had a grin a guitar and a couple of Top 10 hits that hardly anyone knows/recalls anymore. ""Midnight Special"" is a classic American folk song held deeply tucked by historians in their leather binders and tattered sheet music..was it first sung by field workers? Ledbelly? who knows? only that Paul had the first true popular hit.Johnny Rivers/Creedence Clearwater followed with what is now better known versions  sad. Paul had a fun novelty song, ""7 Little Girls Sitting in the Back Seat"", big hit late '50s that even parents liked.. kinda sexy but innocent.Last hit, a top 10, was, ""Happy Go Lucky Me"". Truly weird and wonderful his gulp and giggle vocal made it fun. It was featured in John Waters' 1998 film, ""Pecker"", and might have helped folks rediscover Paul's other recordings.This CD has a nice overview of Paul Evans. It sounds fine  although I must say that the original Guaranteed 45's have a ring that sings late scratchy and with a light that shines...A PS: Paul wrote ""Roses Are Red"", a signature song for Bobby Vinton..sentimental sweet awkward  with a signed yearbook ending .. It is Horrible. That's all I can think to say. This guy must have used a  kareoke--he wouldn't be able tp afford a band and no studio would possibly  spring for one.  iF SOME OF THE OLD GONE ROCK STARS COULD HEAR THIS THEY'D  BE SPINNING IN THEIR GRAVES LIKE PINWHEELS.  Iis tone deaf, he accents the  wrong phrases and worse he tried to imitate the folks who first recorded it  instead of using his own style. Listen to this before you buy.

350,694,B0000009J9,"You have most probably come to this second of a brief 3-volume series from Ace Records of London, England by searching under artist or, perhaps, song title, so I repeat part of what I wrote for the opening volume. Back in the days when hit singles were based upon one side or the other of a 78- and then 45-rpm release, labels were not always keen when both sides of a record received enough air- and jukebox play to earn itself a place on the charts. The reasoning was quite simple: far better to have songs good enough to receive that kind of attention issued separately. A record where BOTH sides were considered major hits and million sellers (e.g., Elvis Presley's Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel) would be far better off garnering sales of a million each. But where some artists were concerned, and again I cite Presley, any plans to the contrary by people like Colonel Tom Parker proved fruitless as every one of his singles at RCA Victor, beginning with Heartbreak Hotel/I Was The One in 1956, to Good Luck Charm/Anything That's Part Of You in 1962 were two-sided hits. That's something like 19 straight single releases!In most cases, however, the artists had to be satisfied (and were naturally ecstatic) if just one side scored because the two-sided hit was, for the most part, a rarity. Only the major stars, or some lucky enough to have had their record ""flipped"" by DJs enough to grab attention, received that honour.In Volume 1 there were five cuts that have gone into the books as hit singles, and here that is reduced to four (one with a bullet): Little Queenie by Chuck Berry also made it to # 80 Billboard Pop Hot 100 as the flip of his 1959 # 3 R&B;/# 32 Hot 100 Almost Grown; Red Sails In The Sunset by Tab Hunter (with the Billy Vaughn orchestra) got as high as # 57 Top 100 (note that the Top 100 became the Hot 100 sometime in late 1958) as the other side of his huge hit, Young Love, which spent 6 weeks at # 1 in early 1957 and also made it to # 8 R&B; Sail Along Silvery Moon, an instrumental by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra, may have been the B-side, byt when it finished at # 5 Top 100 early in 1958 it beat out the intended A-side, Raunchy, which peaked at # 10; and Love Is A Swingin' Thing by The Shirelles, as the flip of their 1962 # 1 Hot 100/# 3 R&B; Soldier Boy, managed to get to # 109 on the Hot 100 ""Bubbling Under"" charts.Two oddities of sorts are Rubber Dolly by Bill Parsons and The Monster by Billy Ford & The Thunderbirds. The latter was the B-side to the 1958 # 6 R&B;/# 9 Top 100 hit La Dee Dah billed to Billy (Ford) & Lillie (Bryant), while the other backed the 1959 # 2 Hot 100/# 16 R&B; smash, The All American Boy. The story behind that varies, depending upon the source, ranging from the name ""Bill Parsons"" being a pseudonym for the real singer, Bobby Bare, to a labeling mistake by the Fraternity label, to a tacit agreement between two old friends that Bare's voice would lend itself more to the narrative style applied to All American Boy. Well, Bill Parsons was very real and he does do Rubber Dolly. For the true story, you'll just have to buy the album and read the fabulous liner notes that are a hallmark of all Ace releases, led by their magnificent multi-volume Golden Age Of American Rock `N' Roll and Golden Age Of American Popular Music series, as well as smaller series such as Early Girls and Teen Beat (an all-instrumental series).As to the rest, many were indeed good enough to have become hits on their own in the right circumstances and are sure to please both casual fans of that bygone era and the hard-core collector. Many of the sides you just won't see anywhere else, and that's especially true of the One-Hit Wonders like The Pets, Robin Luke, and Gerry Granahan (who also had hits as part of Dicky Doo & The Don'ts and The Fireflies) for whom you only ever see their one hit. I can't believe I'm lauching another missive of disappointment at my beloved ACE releases. Most of them are superior but everyone trips and stumbles. Ace has done so with Vol 2 of the Fabulous Flips.Years back, I purchased Volume One (it didn't have a volume number actually assigned for they probably didn't know how far they'd run with this concept). I was overjoyed with the release. It had many flips I loved as a kid playing my 45s.It took me awhile but I did eventually discover both Vol. 2 & 3 on Amazon. After going 'round & 'round, I decided to get only Volume 3 for at the time I couldn't get adequately thrilled with Vol. 2. Once again Vol. 3 knocked me out. Not so many of the flips I enjoyed in my youth but some great stuff anyway.Then Vol. 2 disappeared as a new item and the used price skyrocketed. [Out of print for a while I'm guessing.]I wasn't about to spend a lot of money for something I was hesitant about anyway. After a year or so it has once again appeared new and as reduced priced ""used"". I finally decided to get it. I had been searching to see if ACE did a volume 4. That's how I found that Vol. 2 was there again, but no further volumes.Yoi and double yoi. It suffers quite a bit. First I/'ll acknowledge that this is the only way one can find a lot of these tracks. I either do or did at one time have almost all of these 45s. Only Chicken Necks, The Monster, and Havin'So Much Fun, Little Queenie and Why were worth playing on 45. The years have not made the rest of them any more desirable. (The more I think about this I'm reducing my initial 3 stars to 2. ALthough, it's not letting me change it. )There are so many good flips out there from the pre-Beatle era. And I'm not talking about the more obvious, Presley, Berry, Holly, Beach Boys, etc. Here are just a few I think would glorify any flips disc: Dirty Tricks-Carousels [flip of Never Let Him Go]; Something Old, Something New-Lonnie Russ [My Wife Can't Cook]; Ral Donner-I Didn't Figure on Him [Please Don't Go]; Time Will Tell-Majors [A Wonderful Dream]; Hanky Panky-Raindrops [That Boy John] and The Answer to Everything-Del Shannon [So Long, Baby].Given that the only other ""flips"" disc I have found is something called Phil Spector's Flips and Rarities, I can only advocate strongly that ACE get back in the flips business. (And I won't mind if they take a few of my suggestions.)","Oldies,Soul,Pop,Special Interest,R&B,Rock,Oldies & Retro",probably come second brief volume series ace records london england searching artist perhaps title repeat part wrote opening volume back days hit singles based upon one side rpm release labels always keen sides record received enough air jukebox play earn place charts reasoning quite simple far better good enough receive kind attention issued separately record sides considered major hits million sellers e g elvis presleys hound dog dont cruel would far better garnering sales million artists concerned cite presley plans contrary people like colonel tom parker proved fruitless every one singles rca victor beginning heartbreak hotel one good luck charm anything thats part probably come second brief volume series ace records london england england searching artist repeat wrote opening volume days hit hit singles singles based side rpm release labels keen sides record received air jukebox play earn place charts reasoning quite simple far better good good enough receive kind attention issued separately sides considered major hits sellers elvis presleys presleys hound hound dog dog cruel far better garnering sales artists concerned cite presley plans contrary people colonel colonel tom parker tom tom parker proved fruitless singles rca victor victor beginning heartbreak hotel good good luck good luck charm luck charm

353,702,B0000009L6,"This record has many songs I've never heard that much but all are very enjoyable. One of the songs seems to have a skip on it but I think that is the product. Overall, if you like barbershop harmony you will enjoy this recording. The Chordettes originally came together in 1946 but by the time they began their run of hits in 1954, two of the original four members had been replaced. When they recorded Mr Sandman (their debut hit), the line-up was Lynn Evans, Margie Needham, Janet Ertel and Carol Buschman.The Chordettes spent seven weeks at the top of the American charts in 1954 but just failed to make the British top ten although three cover versions all did so, with Dickie Valentine doing best of them.The Chordettes had three other American top ten hits. The first (Born to be with you) faced no competition from covers in the UK at the time and made the UK top ten. Dave Edmunds covered it in the seventies and had a UK top five hit with it. The second (Just between you and me) didn't chart in Britain for anybody. The third (Lollipop) gave the Chordettes their second and last UK top ten hit despite competition from the Mudlarks, whose version made number two in the UK.Among their American hits that didn't make the top ten, the most surprising is Lay down your arms. In those days, Americans rarely covered British songs (the reverse was very common, of course) but this was an exception - it had provided Anne Shelton with her only number one hit. Other hits included A girl's work is never done, Eddie my love and Never on Sunday.This comprehensive compilation contains all the hits and much more besides including their fine cover of To know him is to love him (Teddy Bears), the song that provided Phil Spector's breakthrough hit is a producer. He, in turn, should be grateful to the Chordettes, who pioneered the girl group sound, which Phil developed and had so much success with.There are shorter Chordettes compilations that contain the essentials (notably the 12-track Fabulous Chordettes), but if you really want to get into their music, this compilation is the one to choose.","Oldies,Pop,R&B,Doo Wop,Rock,Girl Groups,Vocal Pop,Oldies & Retro",record many ive never heard much enjoyable one seems skip think product overall like barbershop harmony enjoy recording chordettes originally came together time began run hits two original four members replaced recorded mr sandman debut hit line lynn evans margie needham janet ertel carol buschman chordettes spent seven weeks top american charts failed make british top ten although three cover versions dickie valentine best chordettes three american top ten hits first born faced competition covers uk time made uk top ten dave edmunds covered seventies uk top five hit second didnt chart britain anybody third l record heard enjoyable seems skip think product overall barbershop barbershop harmony harmony enjoy recording chordettes originally came came together time began run hits original members replaced recorded mr mr sandman sandman debut hit line janet ertel carol chordettes spent weeks american american charts charts failed british cover cover versions versions dickie valentine valentine best chordettes american hits born faced competition covers uk uk time time uk dave edmunds covered seventies hit second chart britain anybody
354,703,B0000009L8,"Yes, Big Mama sang the original Hound Dog well before Elvis made it a classic rock and roll hit. Yes, he went on to make millions (although not off of that song as such but as a fresh sex symbol at a time when the youth of my generation were in desperate need of our own icons) while she made about five hundred dollars off of it. But that is not the whole story. Big Mama had a career of her own beyond that song that while not as financially rewarding (due in part to race but also her drinking problem) as Elvis's nevertheless placed her in the pantheon of female blue singers like Bessie Smith and Memphis Minnie- no little accomplishment in itself.  That is what is being celebrated here. Other classics in this CD include How Come, Nightmare, They Call Me Big Mama and I Smell a Rat. Is this her best compilation. No, I believe that Ball and Chain is but this has a nice selection. Big Mama belts out the tunes but, as a rule, does not try to overpower them with that big voice.

356,707,B0000009OB,"For reasons unbeknownst to me, the powers-that-be at Amazon have deemed my original review unfit for publication. I am undeterred, however, in my quest to warn thoughtful music listeners who have been duped into searching for this allegedly Holy Grail-like recording by critics' reviews of this CD that elevate revisionist history to an all-time high.But for track ten, ""For You"", this CD is abysmal. Not only is it worthless, it is worth less than nothing. Please, go buy ""YHF"" (which you undoubtedly already own), or Spoon's ""Kill the Moonlight"" (which you should own) . . . heck, go dig up your copy of ""Slanted and Enchanted"" and give it a few spins. Anything else will be more rewarding than listening to Alex Chilton's self-indulgent dreck. (If forced to choose between (1) The Combined Greatest Hits of Dexy's Midnight Runners, New Radicals, and Andrew WK on 8-track, or (2) Third/Sister Lovers . . . hmmmm, I wonder if can find an 8-track player on eBay.)Why did I title this review ""Sam Kinison Redux""? After numerous listens to this CD, and contemplating yet another painful listen (silly me, I thought I just didn't get it), I found myself unconsciously uttering part of an old Sam Kinison routine: ""Kill me. Shoot me in the head, run me over with a car, do whatever it takes . . .""Yes, it really is THAT bad. Over the years I have listened to this record when I was miserable, depressed, in dead-end jobs and relationships, lonely, inebriated, and generally giving up on everything. It is no coincidence and is well documented that Alex Chilton was also at this point in his life during the production of Third/Sister Lovers. While plenty has been said about the madness poured into these songs by Chilton, credit also is due to John Fry and Jim Dicksonson who produced this record, matching Chilton's discord with majesty.  This is an album about a complete hopelessness that many of us have felt, the kind of thing you listen to and just stare at the ceiling. This is the record that saved rock and roll from self parody, influenced three generations of independent musicians, and became the grandfather to new romanticism, shoe gazer, emo, and a host of lesser classifications in the rock-pop constellation. Irreplaceable, necessary, and far-reaching, it is imperative that any thinking person own this album.It is perfect in every way.There are two records that marked a paradigm shift in the construction of pop songs that have had enduring influence for decades and whose force cannot be overstated: The Beatles ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and Big Star ""Third""/""Sister Lovers."" Others may point to ""Pet Sounds"" or the sheer endurance of the Rolling Stones, without recognizing that these artists are derivative listeners rather than a neglected pioneer like Alex Chilton. The modern exemplar proof of this statement is no less than Coldplay's Chris Martin at the London Live 8 concert in 2005 when introducing Richard Ashcroft/The Verve's ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" as ""the best song in the world."" Both bands-and that song in particular-owe every note they ever played to Lennon/McCartney, but especially to Alex Chilton.For Alex Chilton is simply the Robert Johnson of his age: virtually unknown, yet influential beyond all description, and this album is his master achievement for which he deserves a place in the rock and roll Pantheon. It has been said of David Bowie that he was always one step ahead of his contemporaries, anticipating shifts and initiating musical trends before other artists could catch up. If this is true, then with ""Sister Lovers"" Alex Chilton was thirty years ahead of his time.Before ""Big Star Third/Sister Lovers"" there had never been an album that recorded so completely an artist's true self expression, intimacy with the unknown listener, liberty, and achingly beautiful compositional skill that was breaking new ground each hour it was recorded. These songs haunt like the shadows of old girlfriends. Perhaps only Dylan's ""Blood on the Tracks"" is of comparable magnitude in being both a memorable and singular artistic achievement.It behooves us to examine the hit songs released in 1974, and see where rock and roll could have gone without this album and the intelligent fan base of aficionados and critics which have sustained its legendary status until the consciousness of the world could catch up. Here then is a list of top radio hits from 1974; it is not a pretty picture: ""Smokin' In The Boys Room"" - Brownsville Station, ""Waterloo"" - ABBA, ""Billy, Don't Be a Hero"" - Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods, ""Already Gone"" and ""Best Of My Love"" - The Eagles, ""Kung Fu Fighting"" - Carl Douglas, ""You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet"" - Bachman-Turner Overdrive, ""Can't Get Enough"" - Bad Company, ""Shang-A-Lang"" - Bay City Rollers, ""Midnight At The Oasis"" - Maria Muldaur, ""I Honestly Love You"" - Olivia Newton-John, and of course, the most horrific cloying noise that vaguely resemble music ever recorded...""(You're) Having My Baby"" by Paul Anka & Odia Coates.Utter waste.If these bands and their records had ascended and became elder gods, we currently would live in a musical lake of pain the likes of which not even a sociopathic synthesis of Clive Barker, H.P. Lovecraft, and Dante could conceive. Horror upon horror would assault us from the radio. We would envy the deaf; stabbing out our ears with knitting needles.Instead, we thank God that Alex Chilton had no money, was leaving his extended adolescence, and had developed a painful distaste for the promises of the record industry and a sublime discrimination in musical influences. And that he had nothing to loose.He was embarking on that slow painful trek to middle age while retaining a slender light of the hope of youth, and he recorded a priceless masterwork for which anyone under thirty who has ever listened to a pop song unwittingly owes their deepest thanks. This is beauty rarely achieved in 10,000 artists' lifetimes, and by the grace of God, Jim Dickinson was there to put it down on vinyl.In closing, I offer a list of bands that would not exist if this record had not been recorded: Radiohead, The Swans, Teenage Fanclub, Primal Scream, Oasis, Coldplay, Blur, Husker Du, The Replacements, Mazzy Star, REM, The Bangles, Lush, Ride, My Bloody Valentine, The Smashing Pumpkins, The White Stripes, The Gun Club, The Boo Radleys, Slowdive, Chapterhouse, Galaxy 500, Curve, Jesus & Mary Chain, Moby, Catherine Wheel, Pale Saints, Ivy, and They Might Be Giants.In short, without Big Star ""Third""/""Sister Lovers"" modern alternative rock simply would not exist.The Cocteau Twins ""Heaven or Las Vegas"" album would not exist. Roxy Music's ""Avalon"" album would not exist. Sigur Ros would not exist.I think that is explanation enough. If you have never heard a note of Big Star music before I would suggest getting #1 Record/Radio City first.  The band was still pretty coherent and if you hear this one first, you might be soured on Big Star forever, and then you'd miss a lot of great music.Now on to Sister Lovers...This is the kind of album that most bands make when they 1) let success go to their heads, 2) are on the verge of a breakup 3) consuming lots of illegal substances or 4) some weird combination of all three.  Many of the songs sound a lot like rough mixes or outtakes. Strange gaps, songs ending on sour notes and a host of over indulgent effects are on nearly every track.So why buy this album?!?Well, frankly, it grows on you.  Chilton is still writing really good songs in spite of the fact that it seems he's hell-bent on destroying them.  Kizza Me rocks, Thank You Friends is perfect pop, Nighttime is an excellent ballad.  Like Exile on Main Street, great moments are on every track despite the rough sound. So, take a chance (after you buy the first two), you'll probably like it! After releasing two classics to critical praise and public indifference Big Star (headed by former Box Tops frontman Alex Chilton) was a band on the brink of a break-up.  This set the stage for this great patch-work album that was never released until several years after its completion.The songs are not the pop masterpieces that permeated #1 Record, nor do they capture the off-the-cuff brilliance of Radio City.  In fact, most of the songs on Thrid/Sister Lovers take the &quot;off-the-cuff&quot; aspect of the Radio City album to the extreme.  Some songs meander to a confused conclusion, others contain strings that are completely out of place, some are under-produced, some are over-produced and there are noticable times when the group loses the beat in mid-song.So why give a high rating to an album that sounds like a drug-induced disaster?Frankly, Chilton has a knack for writing pop that combines the best of the Beatles, the Who and the Byrds, and no matter how much he tries to suppress it, the gift shines through (even on the more mediocre songs).  In addition, there are songs scattered throughout the mess that are just as good, if not better, than the best songs on #1 Record or Radio City( like Nighttime and Thank You Friends).I would recommend buying this only after purchasing #1 Record/Radio City.  You'll appreciate the songs more and you won't get a bad first impression of an incredible band. #1 Recordwas a masterpeice of what some call power pop, but Sister Lover's is even better.If on #1 Big Star pumps volume on 1960s British pop, here, they use the same source to create more unique tracks. The songs have a pop rock feel, but the chord changes and textures are not typical of the Kinks-Beatles-Hollies insperation the band fuels #1 with.The overall theme of Third is depression, and the short songs are linked by all kinds of dark sounds, and creepy interludes between tracks.Chilton describes the mood best on this perfect piece of album art. He does not feel he can solve anthing, but he ""wants to white out.""Who has not at one time or another. Alex Chilton is one of rock's most fascinating mysteries wrapped in an enigma. He has been worshipped by Paul Westerberg to the point of having a song written about him. According to a man I spoke to in a bar - a highly articulate, well-informed, and obviously intelligent man - Chilton was a janitor somewhere in Tennessee not too long ago. Most recently, this New Orleans resident was reported missing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Fortunately, the reports of his possible demise were exaggerated. Musically, he was the teenage vocalist on the classic #1 single ""The Letter"", the unlikely producer for The Cramps, and a major influence on the folky, cryptic alternative rock of R.E.M., the trashier rock of The Replacements, and the more straightforward power pop of Teenage Fanclub. (And that's just to cite the ones who are keen enough to know that they were influenced by him and his band.)Although Big Star is thought of as the quintessential American power pop band, you would never know it from their third CD, which I will hereafter refer to as Sister Lovers, because I like that title better. Granted, the disc contains ""Thank You Friends"", which is in the tradition of their classic ""September Gurls"". (Neither of which are, in my opinion, as perfect as the greatest power pop song ever, ""Shake Some Action"" by The Flamin' Groovies, who are also a strong candidate for the quintessential American power pop band.) Apart from that, almost all of the songs on Sister Lovers are stark affairs, ones which stick in your head not because they are catchy but because they're haunting. The range of the band's musical taste - or just Chilton's, as the case may be - is indicated nicely by the covers on the record, which include the sparse ""Nature Boy"" (made famous by Nat ""King"" Cole), an even slower (and French-flavored) version of The Velvet Underground's ""Femme Fatale"", and a spirited take on ""Till the End of the Day"" by The Kinks (which they start off with the opening riffs to The Who's ""Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere""). Chilton is clearly the star of this CD, as he wrote all but one of the original songs. But drummer Jody Stephens gives him a run for his money with his single contribution, ""For You"". This track speaks as much for the tone and brilliance of Sister Lovers as any of Chilton's songs do.There are a few weaker tracks, like ""Kizza Me"", ""You Can't Have Me"", and the cover of ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On"". If nothing else, at least they lighten the mood of the record a bit. The absence of Chris Bell, whose presence was so strongly felt on their debut #1 Record, may explain the lack of higher quality soul and power pop. (Bell had left the group in 1972, and was killed in a car crash in 1978.) However, this same absence allowed Chilton to make Sister Lovers the tormenting masterpiece that it is. This may have disappointed many Big Star fans, but the band was never obligated to be a pop group, and they had very little chance of coming out of this record intact anyway. Hence, the result is a record full of frightening tales of despondency, like the horrifically unsubtle ""Holocaust"" - ""you're a wasted face/you're a sad-eyed lie/you're a holocaust"" - and loneliness, like ""Nighttime"" - ""I hate it here, get me out of here"". Other songs seek comfort and salvation in whatever may offer it, be it driving (""Big Black Car""), religion (""Jesus Christ""), or love (""Blue Moon""). And that is hardly where the great songs end. The string-laden ""Kangaroo"", ""Strike It Noel"", and ""Take Care"" are all amazing and probably unlike anything you'll ever hear in popular music.Given the anguished tone of the record, one does have to wonder - as many already have - if the triumphal sounding ""Thank You Friends"" is sincere or bitterly ironic. In this sense, it reminds me of The Kinks' song ""All of My Friends Were There"". While this also sounds celebratory, the lyrics indicate otherwise:  ""And just when I wanted no one to be there/All of my friends were there/Not just my friends, but there best friends too/All of my friends were there/To stand and stare"". Alex, meanwhile, says ""without my friends I got chaos"". Well, if the remainder of the record is any indication, chaos is what he's got a lot of! Is Alex in fact friendless, or were the friends he had simply not there when he needed them to be?Whatever the case, lonely is something that Alex Chilton will never be in the world of popular music, as evinced by a couple of tribute albums and dozens of artists who admire Big Star.  Sister Lovers was a departure from the snap crackle pop of their first two records, but arguably even more ambitious and fully realized than either of them. But while it may be the masterpiece of the band called Big Star, it can't really stand as their most representative opus, as #1 Record and Radio City are just as essential. Alex Chilton once said that he felt that he was joining Chris Bell's band when he became a member of Big Star, and that Bell was the biggest Anglophile in Memphis. With Bell's departure, Big Star clearly became Chilton's band. Thus, Sister Lovers might more accurately be his personal masterwork, while remaining a fascinating piece of the Big Star puzzle. ~ This is arguably the most beautiful rock record ever made. Anyone with working ears who'd argue otherwise probably needs an MRI scan. Even considering the darkly bizarre descent into self-indulgence and madness (on the orig. side two--see below) which is inherently redeemed by ""Thank You Friends"". Score.Unfortunately, although this Ryko set contains the most comprehensive collection of tracks from these sessions to date (incl. all but two cover-rockers that fit in nicely), the haphazard redux running order c/o Chilton is an absolute disaster which imparts NONE of the impact and greatness of the orig. PVC album release from '78. It seems the label got it right, he didn't. I'd hate to think what my experience with it would have been without that crucial reference point. This re-master even clips the brief studio intro on ""You Can't Have Me"" which is now lost forever on CD.[...], snag this...then permanently re-figure it w/ the extras as preferred, just for history's sake and your own precious salvation.Big Star rules. Revisionist Digital Technology blows.Jesus Christ, indeed. There is some worship in these songs, but the common American Jesus persiflage identity theft is thinking of a cold, cold night in which you warm me. Attempts to describe Holocaust with a dead mother in her bed and eyes full of lies fit a pathetic senile tragedy society which keeps wishing it could be younger as the numbers racket bounces around to a global electronic piracy we can't control. I paid for these songs, so I might be taking this situation far more seriously than if I had run out of money like some gypsy boy from the land of the new rising sun where floatation is groovy and even a jellyfish can agree to that (according to the late, great Jimi Hendrix). I met a girl once (at a Big Star concert, actually) who made a point of telling me that Big Star had come along for her at &quot;just the right time&quot;.  Rather than sounding like the typical Rock n' Roll Salvation  myth, it invoked memories of the spooky house I'd been staying in when I  first heard &quot;Sister Lovers&quot;.  I was watching the remote cabin for  a family on vacation and had recently seen too many Alfred Hitchcock  videos.  A mood of inner decay, a cold stillness and the fear of malevolent  ghosts creeping around inside the house was enhanced by the record.  It  offered a strange solace, like hearing the moans of another survivor under  the rubble of a bombed building.  I wondered if she was somewhere close  to there when Big Star came through for her. This is the best rock -n- roll album of all time.It really is much better in the english release with the correct song sequencing, but you can approximate that excellence by simply CORRECTING THE SONG ORDER.  Program your cd player for the following sequence, or remake it as a cdr and you've got it:1.) stroke it noel2.) downs3.) femme fatale4.) thank you friends5.) holocaust6.) jesus christ7.) blue moon8.) dream lover9.) you can't have me10.) big black car11.) kizza me12.) for you13.) o dana14.) nightime15.) kanga roo16.) take careDelete or scatch through the rest of the ""songs"".Enjoy!-robin This is the sound of a band dissolving before your ears, a band that decided to go out with not with a bang but with a fizzle. Ah but what a fizzle it is. It's truly timeless as other reviewers have pointed out. Timeless in that if you heard this thing without any foreknowledge you'd be surprised to find out it was recorded in 1974. But it's oddly incomplete and offhand sounding. Auteur Alex Chilton has lost his band and he's none too happy about it to the point where he sounds like he's beyond caring. Sister Lovers is beautiful in its own sparse and shambolic way but if you want to hear something a bit more cheery I suggest putting on some Radiohead. Big Star chose to go gently into that good night on a raft of despair, without hope and with precious little rock. I've been a rock fan & collector for over thirty years, and I've read many raving reviews of this album by critics (not to mention reviewers on this site) who frequently describe it as a ""lost masterpiece"" of rock. These folks apply terms to SISTER LOVERS like a ""heroic artistic act,"" and ""expression of existential angst.""Baloney.After many listens to SISTER LOVERS, my opinion of it hasn't changed: it's a shabbily-produced, self-indulgent mess consisting mainly of less-than-great Big Star tunes and a couple outright embarrassments. (In fairness, two exceptions to this waste are the exquisitely poignant and beautiful ballad ""Blue Moon"" and the honest, harrowing ""Holocaust."")Big Star was a great band - and deserved to be a famous one. Their commerical failure & resulting collapse was an injustice and a tragedy. But please: don't confuse Alex Chilton's self-absorbed pouting and tantrums during the making of this album with ""existential angst"" or ""heroism,"" and don't spin his willful sabotage of many album tracks as a statement of ""artistic integrity.""You want grief - honestly felt & honestly conveyed? Listen to Neil Young's TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT. You want angst - honestly felt & honestly conveyed? Check out Eric Clapton's LAYLA. Want righteous, thundering anger - honestly felt & honestly conveyed - at the Powers-That-Be? Buy the Clash's first album. Looking for an honest, unflinching, even heroic response to failure and frustration? Buy Mott the Hoople's MOTT. Maybe you want to listen to a plain, unpretentious ""bringing it all back home"" album of heartfelt singing & playing? Lennon's PLASTIC ONO BAND and Springsteen's NEBRASKA fit the bill in their different ways. Or, maybe, you want to listen to an artist's honest struggle against collapse - using his art to affirm life while feeling deep despair. If you want to go there, you need go no further than albums like Sly & the Family Stone's THERE'S A RIOT GOIN' ON, Nirvana's UNPLUGGED, or Robert Johnson's KING OF THE DELTA BLUES SINGERS.To me, SISTER LOVERS isn't remotely in the same league as any of these albums. So I'm bewildered when I read or hear others comparing SISTER LOVERS to one or more of those albums in terms of style and quality. What am I missing here? Am I too dense to ""get"" Chilton's great & profound message? Or has it merely been too long since my adolescence?You want to listen to great Big Star? Buy their first two albums, then download ""Blue Moon"" and ""Holocaust."" But give SISTER LOVERS - and Chilton's adolescent angst - a pass. If you don't like music, this may be for you. I read the hype and thought this may be interesting. This is an hour of my life wasted. ""Third/Sister Lovers"" by Big Star is, quite possibly, the worst cd I have ever heard. There is not one song worth listening to. I played the cd twice (figuring it couldn't be as bad as I suspected after the first listen) and it was worse the second time around. It sounds like something a bad high school band would have recorded in their basement. While I was a fan of Alex Chilton and the Box Tops, with the exception of the song September Gurls, Big Star seems to be a product of myth and the hype machine. Other than the aforementioned September Gurls, Big Star didn't have one song on their three albums that would have been an AM radio hit. It's no wonder that a major recording studio didn't pick them up. The band sounds as if they are stoned throughout the recording. It's disjointed, poorly mixed and the songs are horrible. George Martin himself couldn't have done anything with these tunes. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this dreck. What more can I say. ""Big Star's 3rd: Sister Lovers"" lacks the cohesiveness of the band's first two releases.  This is the work of a group in decay (""Take Care"").  The band is subordinate to Alex Chilton's indulgences in loneliness and  disappointment (""Big Black Car"" and ""Kanga Roo"").  Clearly missing on this  release is Chris Bell.  Had Chris been a member of the group, he would have  objected to the inclusion of mediocre filler like ""You Can't Have Me,""  ""Downs,"" and ""Whole Lotta Skakin' Goin' On.""On a favorable note, Big  Star has always shown an uncanny ability to write luscious love ballads  from an adolescent perspective - gentle, enchanting, selfless and  inquisitive.  Continuing this trend, ""Nighttime,"" ""Blue Moon,"" and ""For  You"" are perfectly crafted pop love ballads.  I'm amazed that Big Star  followers often miss the Christian undertone of Chilton's work.  ""Jesus  Christ"" should set the record straight - this is clearly an  affirmation.""Sister Lovers"" contradicts the light and uplifting pop of  ""Stroke It Noel"" with death (""Holocaust"") and the frightening ""Kanga Roo.""  I'm not at all certain if ""Thank You Friends"" is genuine or coldly  sarcastic.  Although ""Sister Lovers"" is not my favorite Big Star release,  it contains many shining moments. Alex Chilton's finest hour, wherein he set about fashioning a new form of ethereal and hauntingly melancholic pop music that would only begin to take hold of the collective unconscious a decade after it was recorded.  In fact, this music sounded so other-worldly back in the mid-70's that it spent several years in the vaults prior to its first release.  Vocals were delivered in a narcoleptic haze of self-deprecation and the sparse instrumentation was bathed in previously uncontemplated layers of reverb, creating a simultaneously cold and intimate musical space at odds with most of the shiny happy pop of the time.  But it's the quality of Chilton's songwriting that is of ultimate value here, to the point that many of the tracks have been radically re-interpreted over the years by the likes of This Mortal Coil and Jeff Buckley without losing any of their distinctive character. I am not going to lie to you, this album is very difficult to listen to after the first couple spins but is really worth getting used to.  I gave up on this record after listening to it the first time.  Nothing caught my interest like the first record and I really thought I was just wasting my time getting into a band I didn't really know or care much about.  Months later after only reading great reviews about the record whenever I came upon one I decided to go back to Third and give it another chance.  I still didn't think much of it till around the 3rd or 4th time when things finally started to set in.  Even though Third isn't an obvious classic like the two predecessors, it is probably the more rewarding listen.  Third is easily one of the top albums of all time and to say anything less means you have a lot to learn about good songwriting.  It is sad that Chilton was never able to reach the heights of Big Star ever again as he truly was one of the brightest guitar-pop minds of that era.  Just listen to &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Kangaroo&quot; and realize how amazing this guy actually was.  This isn't for everyone, but if you like that era of music and are into all of the main influences on good alternative music it is worth checking out. Though it is a beet childish to decide a certain record is &quot;the best  record ever made&quot; to one's opinion, in that case I have to be childish  and say : &quot;That's actually the best album ever made...&quot; . Dark  yet colorful beautiful songs which fill my eyes with excitement tears of  totally mixed joy and sadness in each time I listen to it.  If you're  interested in more detailed review on the songs take a look at Chris K's  review. I tend to agree with most of what's written there. If you are a  true music lover (one that listens to music and not just uses it as a  'background'), do not hesitate - get it immediately. If Paul and Ringo decided to record an album together and called themselves ""The Beatles,"" would everyone think that was cool? Of course not. Big Star was a quartet, ultimately reduced to two by the time this uneven and often gloomy collection of songs was recorded. Chris Bell defined the sound of, and essentially produced, the excellent debut album ""#1 Record."" If you want to know how much the Big Star sound had already been crystallized before ""LX"" Chilton got involved, listen to the three eventual Big Star tracks on the album by Bell's previous band ""Rock City,"" now commercially available on CD. Fast forwarding back to Big Star, Bell was involved in the first demo session for ""Radio City"" and wrote a good chunk of ""Back Of A Car"" before departing the band. Yes, Chilton deserves credit for carrying on and writing great songs like ""September Gurls,"" for the second album, but by the time his sometimes-cowriter Andy Hummel had also departed, the band had essentially ended. Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens admitted as much when they called themselves ""Sister Lovers"" on the session sheets for the album later mislabled as ""Big Star's Third."" Stephens, as noted by other reviewers, actually writes and sings one of the better songs on the album, ""For You."" Alex has his moments here and there, but seems to have lost his spark for writing and recording what we would now refer to as ""power pop."" And despite his eventual cult status, has never really regained it in any sustained way. Personally, I prefer Bell's ""I Am The Cosmos,"" but if you're going to pick up ""Third,"" get the Bell CD as well, and decide for yourself who still had the chops. To fully appreciate the third Big Star album, you have to understand how it was recorded. In 1974 Alex Chilton was a complete and total mental wreck. Disillusioned by the absence of fame and fortune, he goes into a  studio and purposely takes away any hit potential these songs ever had, not  that &quot;O Dana&quot; was #1 material to begin with. There's some weird  percussion on &quot;Downs&quot; that I'm told is a basketball, but sounds  more to me like banging on pots and pans with a mallet. There's  &quot;Holocaust&quot;, which I always thought was a description of somebody  dying of a terminal illness but that's probably not right. Anyways, it's  easily the most depressing song I'VE ever heard. You? There's just  something really SPOOKY about those female voices in the background and  Chilton lamenting &quot;They stood on the staaaaaiiiirs, laughing at your  errrooooooorrrrrs.&quot;. In fact I think it's the best song they ever did.  As for the rest of the album, the songs have abrupt starts and stops, and  there's some kind of carnivalesque opening to a song called &quot;Jesus  Christ&quot;. It's as if Chilton just thought &quot;Why should I even  bother? It's never gonna go anywhere.&quot; and this was BEFORE the album  was left high and dry (one really good Radiohead number) by terrible record  label distribution and disco pop radio. Yep, this was probably the very  first alternative record ever (a full SEVEN years before the &quot;Radio  Free Europe&quot; Hib Tone single!). Despite the entirely out-of-place  cover of Jerry Lee Lewis' &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On&quot;, this is  easily one of the maybe ten or twenty greatest albums ever made, and the  best version of &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; ever. I have to agree with other reviewers who said that after listening to the first two Big Star albums, this one is somewhat bizarre and disappointing. It has its moments. But its very uneven, half hearted. Chilton was drugged up during the whole production and it shows . Kangaroo and Holocaust? Stoner music, pure and simple. Listen to it sober, the ""brilliance"" of those songs will disappear, trust me. Probably be a hit at an Emo party though. Just depressing. And its not that its not typcial Big Star pop. Its that its such a weak effort on Chilton's part. He sounds like he can barely stand at the mic to sing. I'm a big Big Star fan, but I have to agree with the one star reviewers on the #1/Radio City reviews that people can convince themselves anything is ""genius"" if they hear it enough. Remember kids, ""Just say no"". lol.I do like the sarcasm(?) of ""Thank you Friends"", and the best cover of the Kinks ""Till the end of the day"" I've ever heard. Blue Moon is a good tune also. a beautifully weird record, big star's ""third/sister lovers"" is full of magic. rockers, ringing guitar chords, gentle piano touches, chaotic piano banging, string quartet flourishes, spirited saxophone, percussion that at times sounds like things simply bumping into each other, a whole hodge-podge of sound. completely wonderful. my favorite five tracks: ""thank you friends,"" a great melodic anthem of a song, the whole thing, backing vocalists and all, swelling to a heartpounding finish. ""big black car,"" a song filled with quiet beauty, a slightly off-kilter melody that drifts along in a dreamy soundscape. ""o, dana,"" a great tune with a wistful bouncy melody. ""holocaust,"" slow and chilling, the darkest piece on the record. a completely harrowing glimpse at someone's self-destruction. and finally, ""nightime,"" a gorgeous psychedelia-tinged ballad. all 14 tracks of the original album are fine, the five i mentioned are classics, not to be missed. the cd version includes four bonus tracks which do nothing for the original release and really should not have been included. a classic album, that deserves the place it has carved out in rock history. The fact is that this album is totally hit and miss. For every brilliant 5-star ahead of its time song (Holocaust, Thank You Friends, Oh Dana) there is an equally bizarre, poorly recorded song. I would unhesitatingly recommend this album for the songs that are deathless, but even a psycho Big Star fan like myself has to admit that this album is full of half-formed ideas, experiments, and poor production. However, having said that, I would once again say that the good songs on the album are AMAZING and the album as a whole (weirdness included) is still leagues better than 95% of the music that's out there. Big Star are absolutely amazing, even as they're disintigrating. After listening to #1 Record/Radio City, this album is just depressing.  That may be the intended or unintended point of Third, but that is not what attracts me to music.  Some of the songs, such as Kizza Me and a few others, seem like a waste of space, and the best song on here, Till the End of the Day, is not even a Big Star song.  Also, the inclusion of Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On is completely pointless.  There are a few good moments, and the album would have been a lot better if the length had been cut in half.  In general, Third has absolutely no direction and is a cult classic simply because it is the product of a crazy, albeit influential, guy in a band on the verge of collapse.  By far Big Star's worst album. Show me one thing in the entire John Lennon/Beatles catalogue that's as evocative and transcendent as Big black car. I also re heard it through the grape vine that Holiday Inn just recently sent twenty grand to Alex chilton in order for them to use the song in a series of commercials starring nathan lane. A haunting and disturbing record, yet also comforting and surprising (""Do you wanna dance...?"") this record is a bit of a miracle and I use my cliches lightly.  And it often sounds as if ALEX CHILTON is having a breakdown.  Certainly his band was falling apart, their record label, and some would claim CHILTON's career... Yet listening to this album will be one of the experiences of your life, not just a good listen.  The content of these brilliant ethereal songs is bitter, yet the rich tunes will seduce you and in loving these songs, you will experience a necessary education about any artist's statement.  You may realize that this record is also for anyone interested in the sound and substance of much of the last 25 years... though the record itself dates to nearly 35 years.  By a band most noteworthy for what some have called Power Pop, (but apparently influenced New Wave and even Grunge) like all of BIG STAR's few records, SISTER LOVERS is one of the pioneering albums that recognizes the brilliance of the Brit Invasion model while reconfiguring it.  Many influential bands had a hand in a sound here and there, but no band had more influence on a sound anywhere than BIG STAR did on what came to be called American Alternative rock, or Indie rockers, or what we used to call back in the 1980s ""college radio,"" particularly with this album.  Loaded with tunes and hooks, this remarkable record wasn't released until four years after it had been recorded in 1974 (released in 1978).  Noted by critics because of its obvious and worthwhile influence on an entire generation's disillusionment, this record is the band's touchstone, if not least highly regarded of their three albums by diehard BIG STAR fans (who usually think of this one as a solo CHILTON project).  CHILTON certainly found the direction he was looking for, and has continued to follow, in the ragged and immediate tone of the production, here especially, a brilliant contrivance.  This is another unlikely offering that decades after release, has elbowed its way to the surface as something very much worth listening to ... this release includes ""bonus tracks"" that many would argue always belonged on the album in the first place (particularly ""Dream Lover"") and all noted criticism, I do not find a single dud in 19 tracks (though I, too, usually skip the last one.)  A fascinating mixture of sound and purpose, superb ""Baroque Pop"" arrangements, an unfinished or intentionally circumstantial starkness, and deeply personal and disquieting themes, I give this beautiful and important record, one of the greatest bargain-bin albums ever, the highest rating for its dark magnificence. This is a great record, but it's not a Big Star album. With two members gone and drummer Jody Stephens only partly in evidence, Chilton began his years-long dive into weirdness with this, an apt sendoff to a public that had ignored the genius of his former band (actually, Chris Bell's band). Perhaps it's not so much about an indifferent public. After all, very few people ever had the chance to hear Big Star. I bought the first two albums as they were released, thanks to good reviews in Creem Magazine. I was able to buy Third through an ad in Trouser Press Magazine, on cassette, years after it was recorded and long before it was officially released. It was jarring to hear, to say the least, but my many years-long commitment to Big Star helped me stay the course. Now, of course, they are on the radar, with a film documentary and recent box set. When I had a recording studio in the 90s, I used the first two albums as the blueprint  for how records should sound, thanks to Jim Dickensen and John Fry. Timeless music, I've been playing Big Star songs in my own bands (and have been influenced by them) for several decades. Enjoy this brilliant album but be warned...it's all Alex, not really Big Star! This record is not for the feint of heart, not for wimps, but if you want an existential harrowing pop experience, into the swirling vortex of human desperation, and perhaps back out again, then you must have this record.  There is not a single rock record in existence that so effectively explores the breaking apart and collapse of a person, in this case Alex Chilton.  It is pure genius, and can be savored on many levels.  The vocals, the production, the instrumentation, the lyrics, the emotion, it is all heart-rending, unique, and stunning.  I laugh at some of you who say you don't understand the appeal of this album.  You say that #1 Record and Radio City are better.  Well, my friend, while I am glad that you have experienced those wonderful records, they were a mere preparation for Sister Lovers.  This record is to me the real essence of Big Star.  Have you ever gone on a dark drinking binge, levitating on the edge of the abyss, while at the same time feeling the bright light of cosmic consciousness beckoning you back to better things, but feeling that you may fall in nonetheless?  I was at that stage when I found this album (thank you Paul Westerberg) in 1987.  It resonated with me in a way that very few records ever have (perhaps Quadrophenia in 1978 hit me the same way), so that I felt that I went there with Alex on that journey, that I understood where he was coming from.  So, do not compare it to the first two records.  It is very different.  There is a perfect evolution (devolution?) from Big Star #1 to Big Star #3.  If you are a real fan, you have to take it all the way, and if you think this is not as good as the others, you have come close, but have totally missed the boat. I have owned this CD for about 6 years.  And, to be honest, I wasn't prepared for it, especially after absorbing the sheer pop brilliance of the first two albums.  Immediate is not the first word that comes to mind when listening to ""Third/Sister Lovers"".  In fact, it was only a couple of days ago that I decided to give it another shot.  Only then did then record finally hit me.  Sure, certain songs would catch my attention earlier, the desparation of ""O, Dana"", Steve Cropper achingly beautiful guitar on the cover of VU's ""Femme Fatale"", the crunch of ""Till The End Of The Day"".  But, once the music settles in, the rewards are there, such as the baroque pop of Jody Stephens' ""For You"", which brings to mind The Left Banke, and ""Thank You Friends"", where its hard to tell if Chilton is extending a hand, or simply a finger.  (My guess would be the latter.)  ""Holocaust"" ranks with Japan's ""Nightporter"" as one of the most atmospherically depressing songs ever written.  Then there's ""Kangaroo"", which feels like watching someone lietrally walking a tightrope.  Or how about the junkie lullabye, ""Take Care"", where Chilton incoherent offers advice to a lover/friend/child while staggering and swaying over their bed?  And, yet there are so many beautiful melodies, such as ""Nighttime"" and ""Blue Moon"" (one of the few honest moments of hope on this album.)  No, this is not clean, sweet pop all packaged nicely.  To get to this album, most listeners have to go through #1 Record/Radio City.  Its only through the darker moments of that album do the joys this album become revealed.  Somewhere, in an alternative universe, where Paul Wetserberg is granted his due as a songwriter extraordinaire, where the Raspberries are dominating the pop charts, and Pete Ham continues to write pop gems, Big Star are exactly that... big stars.  Of course, we might not have this very record if that was the case. After establishing himself as a teen popper with The Box Tops, then moving on to proto power pop fame with Big Star's first two Beatle flavored albums, Alex Chilton made a bizarre and daring album called Third/Sister Lovers. This music is not for everyone,a lot of it is dark and quite depressing(""Holocaust"",""Kangaroo""-also later recorded by This Mortal Coil),yet well executed and a brilliant piece of art.A few moments recall Big Star's pop like ""Thank You Friends"" and ""Kizza Me"" yet somehow sound like they are from a darker realm. The bonus tracks from the sessions are cool also,some much in the vein of the loose later solo albums like Bach's Bottom and Flies On Sherbet. The version of The Kinks' ""Til The End Of The Day""(maybe better than the original ?) with an opening riff that sounds like the band is going to play The Who's ""Anyway,Anyhow, Anywhere"" is a cut I play often. I picked this one up mostly for Kangaroo and Halocaust, but soon I discovered that there are many other great songs on it. Jesus Christ, For You, Blue Moon, Nature Boy, Till the End of the Day, and Dream Lover are  all songs that I can listen to countless times. After reading other reviews  of this disc, I saw that many do not like Downs, but I think the song is  great, it has a basketball as a snare and some crazy guitar work. Whole  lotta Shaken goin on is the only song on it that I really hate. If you're  lookin for a good CD with a good 70's sound, this is where to find it. This  disc is glorious. Influencing later bands such as R.E.M. and The Replacements, Big Star is easily the greatest band you've never heard of. While the first two albums are true power pop classics, 3rd is something else entirely. Instead of the beautifully rough recordings of Radio City, there is little left but the roughness. 3rd documents frontman Alex Chilton's descent into despair. 3rd isn't supposed to be &#34;nice;&#34; it isn't even supposed to be &#34;enjoyable.&#34; The album is the purest expression of Chilton's decaying mental state, aided in this downward spiral with elaborate studio effects and a rotating cast of guest musicians. Songs like &#34;Holocaust&#34; and &#34;Kangaroo&#34; ache with an earnest, authentic pain, while &#34;Blue Moon&#34; and &#34;Stroke It, Noel&#34; present the few rays of light in this dark album. Even if &#34;Kizza Me&#34; is the closest this album gets to the classic &#34;Big Star sound,&#34; 3rd is a truly moving piece that is more of an experience -- an experiment in music far flung from popularity -- than an album. If you are looking for a third Big Star album, buy I Am the Cosmos. If you are looking for one of the most genuinely moving experiences in recording history, buy 3rd. The Big Star movie was great, so I ordered the music.  Truely a hidden gem.  You never know when you next treat will arrive. Thanks much.  This cd is really amazing...too bad Big Star was never given any real backing by the record companies, they deserved more recognition. When you have the album for years and have plenty of opportunities to listen to, in varying moods and circumstances, the songs on Third/Sister Lovers stand out, not just because it stand the test of time, but revealed gems that never fail to glisten in progressive brilliance and pop mastery. No other bands or singer could duplicate the greatness encapsulated in Big Star's final 'album' of sorts. In my opinion, it is far superior to their earlier two albums, namely, #1 Record and Radio City. While their earlier 2 albums are well crafted and contain several all-time outstanding songs ever composed and performed, Third/Sister Lovers edge forward in unbridled creativity and emotions. The album is not thoroughly depressive, but more of a thoughtful intensity ranging from the forlorn wistful mood of ""Nightime"" to the angry rock in ""You can't have me"". The errie but ingenious ""Kangaroo"" still remained unimitable. The rousing, haunting guitar strokes and grooves evoke undulating and desperate melancholy in artistic uninhibition. Overall, I feel Third is an honest and masterful collection, glittering ever more in the current flooding of mechanical, lacklustre music ruling popular media. I was first introduced to Big Star unknowingly via the gorgeous (though admittedly lugubrious) covers of ""Kangaroo"" and ""Holocaust"" done on the first This Mortal Coil album. I was 14 (the year was 1988) when I discovered that album, and being immersed in late 70s and 80s new wave and goth and all that 4ad stuff, I hadn't a clue nor a care about who the hell Alex Chilton was. All I knew was that these were beautiful covers of songs I naively presumed to be dated folk or something, and that these covers must have improved greatly upon the obscure originals.Fast forward to college, mid-90s: a friend stumbles on a copy of the Ryko ""Sister Lovers"" reissue and puts ""Kangaroo"" on a mix tape for me. I immediately assumed it was a cover that some contemporary indie band had done recently. Interesting and oddly familiar. Then my friend tells me it's Big Star, that this was the original version, and that it was recorded in 1974. Needless to say, my jaw dropped to the floor. This song sounded NOTHING at all like anything written or recorded in 1974. The feedback, the ultra-clear, wet, reverbed-out production, the singing, etc, ... A lot of revolutionary artists were making ground-breaking records in '74, from John Cale to Roxy Music to Brian Eno to Can to Faust, but none of it really anticipated this particular sound that so many bands would ape (sometimes without realizing it) in the 80s and 90s.I soon got a copy of ""Sister Lovers"" and was immediately blown away by the seminal songwriting and arrangements. It was clear that bands like the Cocteau Twins took something from mellow, gorgeous, melancholic, atmospheric tunes like ""Big Black Car,"" ""Take Care,"" and ""Holocaust."" It was also clear that ""Stroke it Noel"" and ""For You"" perfected what many call ""baroque pop"": pop songs centered around chamber-like, stringed arrangements, they pushed ""Smile""-era Beach Boys and Love's ""Forever Changes"" into a whole new territory. Echo & the Bunnymen's classic ""Ocean Rain"" might not have been quite the same without this.The atmosphere and overall mood, the sometimes incomplete arrangements, the desperate, sometimes bitter and sardonic vocals, suggested the sound of a band falling apart (which indeed was happening at the time). The use of space, reverb, and spare, sometimes jagged and jarring arrangements and mood swings, the sense of anger and defeat, all worked its way into so many 80s new wave/post-punk records, one couldn't begin to keep track. From Echo and The Bunnymen to the Go-Betweens, from the Replacements to Sonic Youth, few records have influenced such a wide array of artists.What's even more fascinating about this album is how timeless it sounds. When you listen to those other ""ahead of their time"" records, like ""Pet Sounds,"" ""Forever Changes,"" ""Another Green World,"" ""VU w/ Nico,"" etc, it's pretty easy to tell which decades they were recorded in. But with ""Sister Lovers,"" the sound isn't derivative of anything that was happening during its time of creation. If I knew nothing about Big Star and I simply heard ""Sister Lovers"" w/ out any band photos or anything lying around for contexxt, I swear I might've placed it somewhere in the 80s or 90s. That, my friend, is what I would call ""timeless"".The hooks, the atmosphere, the anguish, the tension, it's all here in unrivaled glory. What's even more remarkable is how different this was from the first two Big Star releases, which were filled with tight, English-sounding, fairly conventional pop songs with straight-forward arrangements and sounds. (Those two albums, as important as they are in their own respective ways, do happen to sound a bit dated). This is an album that grows on you with repeated listens. An album where new surprises continue to reveal themselves even after you've owned it for several years. As a collection of haunting, pretty, offbeat pop, or a blueprint for countless bands and movements to come, this album cannot be overlooked. Another great  album/CD  by a great band .  My husband had never heard of them though I  talked abouthow much I always loved them.  Sadly I never owned any Big Star music until my husband purchased thesetwo CD's  (Third/Sister Lovers  &  # 1  Record/Radio City ) .  My husband is now enjoying Big Star ! ! !BIG STAR  * * * * *  No Gimmicks > > >  Lots of  talent and heart . . . When a certain national rock magazine reviewed rycodisk's re-release of Third/Sister Lovers, they included an illustration of an archeologist opening an ancient tomb revealing a glowing star. That picture summed up  perfectly the effect Big Star has had on me. The review and the rating of 5  stars was enough to make me take a chance on a album and group that I had  never heard of before (up until this point I had never bought any music  that was not on the radio or MTV). This album was a revelation that there  was a whole world of great music that isn't in the public eye (or ear). I  agree with several of the previous reviewers that this album takes a while  to get into, but the effort will yeild great and repeated rewards. I won't  go into a track by track description but the general feeling of this album  is similiar to Pink Floyd's The Wall, but while The Wall sounds  premeditated and theatrical, Third sounds personal and genuine. While I  have bought many outside the mainstream albums since Third ( including the  other 2 great Big Star albums) none have ever equaled this album's power.One last thing that needs repeating...if you don't like this album the  first few times you hear it, keep coming back, come back when your alone,  come back when its raining, come back when you want to get away from it  all...once this album clicks for you, you'll wonder how you ever got along  without it. I want to like them but they don't overwhelm me the way hearing say Velvet Underground or the Modern Lovers did for the first time.  For a cult group you never hear on the radio but cited as an inspiration by so many alternative bands, Big Star comes off quaint.  Perhaps I was expecting too much.  They aren't known for being doomy or avant garde, just fun loving guys who made power pop versions of Brit Invasion type songs.  This album is technically not a BS album, really a Clinton solo that the record company released under the band name.  My download only gave me 17 out of the 19 songs listed so beware if getting this on MP3. If John Lennon and Nick Drake had gotten together to make an album, they  might have created SISTER LOVERS.  Sort of a Plastic Ono Band meets Pink  Moon.  Not for campfire sing-alongs, but wonderful music to contemplate  slitting your wrists to. On first listen, this is a hard album to warm up to. Listening to the 1st two albums in no way prepairs your for this one since the sound is so very dissimilar. I bought the album when it first came out & after one listening I put it away. Fast forward a couple of years after a divorce durring a time when I didn't have much to buy new albums & went back into my collection. I gave this one a spin & I was absolutly floored! Yes the mix is muddy in places & instruments come & go in sometimes odd places but this sounds like a man absolutly at the end of his rope. Many people have rightfully compaired this to Syd Barrett but it's more than that. A lot of Syd's problems were from his own making but Alex on the surface did everything right - great songs, well recorded & critically acclaimed. Not the mention his previous success with the Box Tops. Too bad few ever got to hear those records because of dreadful distribution. By the time this came out dispair set in & Big Star was down to a duo & broke resulting in a tour de force of desparation. This isn't an album to cheer you up unless it makes you feel better to hear songs by someone who is feeling worse than you do. Even the songs that sound happy on the surface have an underlying feeling of doom. But stick with it - it's well worth the effort. If you do like this search out Alen Chilton's solo album ""Like Flies On Sherbert"" for a further trip down this road. While I prefer the more straighforward sounds of the first 2 records, this is still a fascinating listen. By the time this album was being made, Big Star was on it's last limbs, and not only is this the sound of a band falling apart, the songs often seem to be literally falling apart too. The whole druggy, disheveled atmosphere of the album makes the rockers wiry and desperate, the ballads haunting (especially &quot;Nightime&quot;, &quot;Holocaust&quot; and the infamous &quot;Kanga-roo&quot;), and even what would otherwise seem to be upbeat pop (&quot;Thank You Friends&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;) feels ambiguously sarcastic. Unless you prefer your pop with a bit of the deconstructive treatment I'd reccomend #1 Record/Radio City first, but this is still an essential piece of the Big Star picture, and it can even make you listen to the first two albums in a completely different way. ""Third/Sister Lovers"" was recorded as follow up to ""Radio City"" in 1975. Of the original members only Chilton and Stephens were left and a lot of different musicians contributed to the recordings. John Fry was also involved during the recordings of Big Star's first two albums as engineer/producer. Due to the earlier albums' lack of commercial succes the album was not released until 1978 in the wake of the punk/new wave which gave renewed interest in bands like Big Star.Musically most of this album differs a lot from the first two. Many of the tracks are cleary not a band recordings, but more like solo performances by Chilton with various guest musicians. The are exceptions, though. On songs like ""Thank You Friends"" and ""Jesus Christ"" the old Big Star feeling is still there.The album shows a lot of different moods. There are moments of desperation on songs like ""Kizza Me"", ""Downs"" and ""You Can't Have Me"", beautiful ballads like ""Stroke It Noel"", ""Nighttime"" and ""Blue Moon""; gloomy mystrious moods on ""Holocaust"", ""Kangaroo"" and ""Dream Lover""My favourites: Thank You Friends, Jesus Christ, Stroke It Noel, For You, Nighttime and Blue Moon.Look out for the 2005 reunion album ""Big Star in Space""! Big Star-Third ***1/2One of the most melancholy albums of all time. Third, Big Stars final album plays as an album of eternal sadness. But by the end of the record you feel that there is a glimmer of hope for our heroes, namely Alex Chilton, but ironically the group would never make another album so this would not be hopeful.So after releasing to fantastically classic albums to absolutely no success Chilton and grew purposely made the most noncommercial album they could. They nailed it, but at the same time they made one hell of a record.'Femme Fetale' is startlingly good, and 'Kizza Me' is obnoxious, while 'Jesus Christ' is the least offensive track the album holds.While not Big Star or Chilton's greatest achievement Third is a worthy addition to a collection. There are bleak albums and then there is ""Third"". There is nothing quite so unhinged in the whole rock canon (there is not even an agreed track listing for the album), so swaying back and forth between manic lows and forced cheery highs as ""Third"".""Thank You Friends"" is probably the best Big Star song there is, tainted with a compelling dash of bitterness. ""Jesus Christ"" is the best Christmas song you'll never, ever hear on FM radio. And ""Holocaust"" is one of those rare songs that instantly bring down a weight of foreboding on any listener. And when Alex Chilton sings ""I'd rather shoot a woman than a man"" it's simply unblievable that he could consider anyone but himself.Quite simply, ""Third"" is the sound of depressives being forced to write happy songs -at gunpoint. Big Star's Third is every thing an album should be. It has 19 songs full of different styles of music. A few great cover songs, including great versions of Femme Fatale, Till The End Of The Day and Whole Lotta Shakin'  Goin' On. Also, many great original songs, like Thank You Friends, Jesus  Christ, For You, Nightime and Take Care. And It's all done by a great,  revolutionary band like Big Star. What else could you ask for? On its own Sisterlovers, wouldn't make it. It has a few nice moments, and others where you wonder which is weaker, the song or Chiltons voice. I like Big Star and highly recommend #1 Record and Radio city to fans of really good pop/rock ( I hate the term power pop). With more weight than Rasberries by far , more of an American equivalent to Badfinger . This album is odds and ends  with  not very strong attempts to salvage the better material. by all means give it a listen and hear the brighter spots, but only  after hearing the first two albums mentioned , can it then  be approached with a bit more understanding. This is by far, like I stated above, the most overlooked and underrated album of the last 30-40 years. Rolling Stone got it wrong at ranking this #456 or whatever album of all time.The thing that really gets me is how far ahead of the times this album was. In terms of instrumentation, content, production, song structure, guitar effects, the use of strings, etc. Alex Chilton really has his finger on the pulse.This could be considered the real birth of alternative rock. I mean, what with the string arrangements, this album could be thought of a precursor to alt rock classics like ""bitter Sweet Symphony"", R.E.M.'s ""Automatic for the People"", Radiohead, Bright Eyes, Sufjan Stevens,etc.And usually that kind of music really annoys the crap out of me. But something else is going on; Alex Chilton is managing to create all these new sounds, but manages to still hone that classic Big Star magic, giving it a very faint old time feel, at least to me. The point is, he pulls it off masterfully.This is an album anyone born during or after the 80's must definitely experience.Boosh. I burned Big Star's first two records from a friend and felt incredibly disappointed. While I had huge expectations from reviews I'd read and talking to a few people, I was sorely disappointed. I thought the songs were often great, but I didn't get what the big deal is. In my opinion, the only songs that didn't sound derived from Byrds/Beatles rock sounded a bit crappy - especially the rockier stuff. I can understand why people like the stuff, but other than ""September Gurls"" it wasn't for me. I wrote them off as a good but overrated band.Then I heard songs like ""Big Black Car,"" ""Kangaroo,"" ""Take Care"" and ""Holocaust"" and could barely believe my ears at the gorgeous, tired melancholy. If you want slick production or want more of the old Big Star, this is not your thing, but I prefer my productions a bit ragged at times because it ups the emotional factor. There are only a couple of songs here that don't strike me as perfect, most notably the POINTLESS inclusion of ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On."" But ignoring that, I think that it may be one of the best albums ever. The amount of influence this has had on modern music can not be underrated. If the early Big Star did not impress you (or even if it did), please give this one a try. How many times have you thought that? On those gray days, where everything you say comes out wrong and you just wanna be alone...with your music. The hardest part is picking the right soundtrack for those moods from  introspective to outright moody. Or it was before this manna from Heaven  bestowed by the archive gods @Ryko (don't forget to thank them for putting  together a CD of the late Chris Bell of Big Star)fell from the sky. I tell  ya every time it snows, and it takes forever for the buses to come around,  I bring this baby along in my walkman. It is dissonant,quiet an experiment  where the results are still uncertain. The whole thing is like a concept  album in ambiguity. by the time &quot;Big Black Car&quot; comes on, it's  like someone recorded a whole life's worth of sorrow into 3 minutes. Just  an incredible achievement. But get your friends hooked on Radio City/#1  record first. i agreee 100% w/ the chap who said this hadto grow like &quot;exile on main street&quot; and &quot;astral weeks&quot;; i feel exactly the same w/ this record and w/ those records...and also now Kid A. Y'gotta let a little love grow. I even felt kinda th' same w/ &quot;pet sounds&quot; and &quot;highway 61&quot; and &quot;blonde on blonde&quot; and several others...we expect too much immediacy w/ even nominally &quot;popular music'. For me, it is only the very pinnacles of classic pop (ie the beatles, motown etc) which have that kind of immediacy, most everything else needs to be LISTENED to OVER &amp; OVER again before one can 'get it'...admittidely some take longer than others...ie &quot;trout mask replica&quot; but there y'go...IN Short: this record (and the two before it) is marvellous and will make you wonder how you had gone so long w/out listening to big star...the best songs arre the slower ballad ones (&quot;blue moon&quot;, &quot;nightime&quot;, &quot;holocaust&quot; etc) and then the weird-kick-ass psycho ones (&quot;kanga roo&quot;, &quot;stroke it noel&quot; etc etc)...but really the entire album kicks (i even like the much-maligned &quot;whole lotta shakin goin on&quot; cover...talk about acknowledging yr influences...)... I don't like these albums so much - I will admit that they are great for conveying the kind of &quot;beautiful sadness&quot; that must have been going on in Chilton's mind at the time. But I prefer the &quot;fun&quot; Big Star stuff much better, the ballsy hard rocking stuff like &quot;Don't Lie to Me&quot; and the &quot;When My Baby's Beside Me&quot; more than the pseudo-experimental stuff here, as well-executed as it might be. Hope this helps. If ""Number One Record"" and ""Radio City"" were soundtracks for the dazed and confused high side of the 1970's, then ""Third/Sister Lovers"" could be described as the bottom falling out.  It's the morning that your best friend showed up on your doorstep strung out from a night of bad drugs.Drummer Jody Stephens' ""For You"" is the brightest spot on this play list.  The rest of the material is Alex Chilton's, and it sounds familiar on the first couple of songs, even though the hooks are delivered with a sneer.  Then, with ""Big Black Car"", the album plunges into a soporific, drugged murkiness.  Backing vocals and guitar effects are often blurred and ghostlike, as if the record was recorded in the hotel featured in S. King's ""The Shining.""But, ""Third"" isn't all darkness.  Much of the album is about a search for innocence and salvation.  With the childlike ""Stroke it Noel"", the album begins to lighten.  The last couple of songs, ""Blue Moon"" and ""Take Care"", are weary and beautiful--the welcoming rays of a new day, and a peaceful resolution.Essential listening for its honesty and the devil-may-care risks it takes. Dont believe the nay-sayers. I own over 700 cd's and can safely say this is top material all the way through. Its not easy listening and dont listen to it when u are down... its so depressing. I substracted 0,5 point for adding Whole lotta shakin'goin on at the very end. This track completely ruins the tension and atmosphere built up in 2nd part of the album.regards,Peter When I was first turned on to this record, I was a new transfer student after spending the greatest 3 years of my life at another school. I didn't want to leave, but financial realities made it necessary to do so.I was living in a house with 2 people I didn't know at first and when I did get to know them, I didn't like them.I played this record over and over - Loosing myself in the spaced-out echoes and haunting melodies. A line from &quot;Nighttime&quot; played around and around in my head all year long:&quot;Get me out of here, Get me out of here, I hate it here, get me out of here&quot;But somehow I took comfort in the sounds. Knowing that someone else knew how I felt.This is not typical Big Star music. But what it is is a big warm blanket of emotion that you can wrap yourself in when you're feeling down. And know that it will all be better.Pure, unfiltered emotion. In all fairness, to call this lp a record, no less a Big Star record, isn't quite right. The band was a mere shell of its former self by this period, ripe with internal conflicts and Alex Chilton's escallating drug abuse. Even the source of the title- Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens were dating sisters at this point- shows the odd dynamics of the band during this period.The music more than reflects this bizarreness. Chilton's sense of drug-induced paranoia is so palpable here that it reminds me why I stopped taking drugs a few years back. It is along the lines of Neil Young's &quot;Tonight's the Night,&quot; and Syd Barrett's &quot;The Madcap Laughs.&quot; They plunge to the depths of absolute terror- the way-too haunting &quot;Holocaust&quot; is an obvious choice- yet recover enough to take on the Kinks, Jerry Lee Lewis, and standards. The results are horribly/wonderfully uneven, leaving little to the imagination as to why Chilton ultimately abandoned these songs, and Big Star with it.Chilton would reach the pinnacle of his haze on his cult-favorite &quot;Like Flies on Sherbert&quot; lp. Big star never recovered- the death of founder Chris Bell made sure of that. The legacy of Big star is cemented based on their &quot;#1 record,&quot; but Chilton's descent into the depths of drug-induced paranoia is an equally compelling legacy, for the wrong reasons. Like Barrett, Skip Spence, Arthur Lee, Roky Erickson, Sky Saxon, and Arnaldo Baptista (bassist and founder of Brazilian psychedelic cult favorites Os Mutantes), Chilton will likely be remembered as much, if not more, for his drug use than his amazing talents, and this is wrong. As Big Star regains notice and popularity, let's remember Chilton for the MUSIC- and there is plenty of gems to go around. I have seen that some of the reviewers of this, the Third release by Big Star, claim it to be a classic.  A dark testimony of a troubled artist flipping the bird to his management and the record industry.  I just don't get it.  A fan of the first two Big Star releases and no stranger to dark and daunting works by other artists, all I get from this is a feeling that Alex Chilton laughs his heinie off everytime he cashes a royalty check from sales of this album.  A collection of unfinished pieces, dirges, fair, but unspectacular covers and unfocused songs, I have tried numerous times to try to get into it's murk without success.  It probably does an excellent job of showing the state of the artist at the time, but honestly, how many times do you go back and listen to this if you own it?  If you come to this expecting a legendary work, take the time to preview this before parting with your hard earned money.  Buyer beware!! This is a great unfinished work.  The original PVC release of 1978 contains the best and most logical sequence of songs, even if that is not what Alex Chilton and Jim Dickinson  (the authors of this work, not &quot;Big Star&quot;)  intended.  &quot;#1 Record&quot; and &quot;Radio City&quot; are, of course, very fine albums, and the best &quot;power-pop&quot; recordings ever made.  &quot;Third/Sister Lovers/Beale Street Green&quot; is something else entirely.  Perhaps you could call it experimental, but I would just call it confused.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  There are moments of great beauty here--&quot;Nightime&quot; and &quot;O, Dana&quot; and &quot;You Can't Have Me.&quot;  The way Alex Chilton sings &quot;she's not afraid to take a chance&quot; in &quot;O, Dana&quot; is probably the highlight of his vocal career.  &quot;Kanga Roo&quot; I always liked; &quot;Holocaust&quot; I avoid.  I am not sure why the bad covers of the Kinks and Jerry Lee Lewis, and &quot;Nature Boy,&quot; for that matter, are included here, as they detract from the tone of the other tracks.  &quot;Downs,&quot; though, which wasn't included on the original '78 release, fits perfectly.  Pop music, and the great era that we loosely call the &quot;'60s,&quot; ended in 1974, and this music is its death knell.  It's also a portrait of a haunted, failing city--Memphis, which during this era was in serious spiritual trouble.  I mean, I'm no conservative or anything--conservative people will run in horror from this music--but if there's ever been a record that says &quot;don't do drugs,&quot; it's Big Star's &quot;Third.&quot; I remember listening to this album on vinyl as a kid. &quot;Big Black Car&quot; floored me with it's emotion. It was a lot to handle for a 10 year old but in some way I identified with it. &quot;Stroke It Noel&quot; is another stand out track. Typically Chilton-esque- poppy but touching and sad too. I can't say enough good things about this album. If you are like me - melancholy and nostalgic - and long for the days of your youth when everything was perfect and every emotion was visceral buy this album. It's my favorite Alex Chilton music. Third is best listened to, late at night, in a darkened room, in a contemplative mood. Others have said far more and more eloquently than I, but I will confine myself to stating that Big Black Car, Nighttime, Blue  Moon and Take Care are some of the most beautifully fractured songs ever.  Holocaust is sad beyond words, harrowing yet strangely moving. Approach  with caution if you loved No. 1 Record and even Radio City, but if you give  it the chance this is one of the most amazing records you'll ever hear. Good and sometimes great mnusic here.  It's a double album so you'll find your money well spent.  Some real gems to listen to. This album is definitely much different than the first two. I had the first two (""#1 Record"" and ""Radio City"") for decades before I ever saw a copy of this record. But there it was one day, (4 Men w/ Beards re-issue), so naturally I grabbed it. I had heard a number of people claim that ""3rd"" was the best Big Star album, but I was pretty underwhelmed upon first spin. And second spin. This is an album that takes a little ""soaking in"" to be appreciated.I still can't say that I think it's their best. If you've heard good things about Big Star, (if you've heard about Big Star at all, you've heard good things about them), but have yet to check them out, I would recommend getting the first two albums first. If you already have the first two, then yeah, get this one, too. But whatever you do, get a Big Star record. Upon Listening to ""Third"" I really couldn't begin to understand all those reviewers that claimed this was only demo stuff unworthy of release.Did they listen to the same album I did,did they listen to what I consider to be without the shadow of a doubt Alex Chilton's finest hour and one of the most touching and poignantly beautiful works of artistic passion in rock's history.A soulbearing pop masterpiece(and the heartbreaking ""Blue Moon"" is my choice for Chilton's best song). If you're browsing for Big Star because of their well deserved rep,make this your second purchase after # 1 Record/Radio City. Not much in the way of &quot;power pop&quot; on this disc.You have to let it get to you. This album is all across the map, and in all the right places. The songs on Big Star's second album radio city were on the verge of chaos, and this album shows what happens when you go over that edge. Although not psychedelic per se, the songs fit together in such idiosyncratic ways that it's enough to remind you of syd barrett's solo period. I give it the five stars because it is THE GOOD. Alex Chilton is an enigma. When Big Star's first album appeared, he and collaborator Chris Bell created a perfect marriage between soulful rock and power pop. By the time of the second album, Bell was gone and Chilton was fully in charge. Still, their second album had as many highlights as the first although it was a bit more ragged.Then came Third. Chilton's career can be summarized as follows; very talented musician who chucks it all to do very esoteric albums and erratic concert dates. Third demonstrates Chilton falling apart. In its raw, unfinished state, it's a fascintating record but certainly not his best. Really, this is an Alex Chilton solo album in all but name.Some of the music is quite powerful while some quite trival. They're mixed side by side. If anything this reminds me of the erratic Let It Be for than anything else. Messy, magnificent, and morose, _3rd/Sister Lovers_ may not be as overtly relevant now as it was to the music scene in the late 80s-early-to-mid-90s, nevertheless many many bands wear the face of Big Star on their masks - Teenage Fanclub, the Replacements, The Pixies, Nirvana, the list goes on and on and on.  You can still hear the lonely echoes of this album today.  The album is disturbing to say the least, it's pure pop so completely deconstructed, to the point where hooks are nonexistent, and YEARS before any other band had the [guts] to do so.  In many instances you can hear that the songs started out as bouncy pop songs but ended up being deliberately sabotaged by the precocious and depressed Chilton - two of the bonus tracks, &quot;Dream Lover&quot; and &quot;Downs&quot; illustrate this perfectly.  The walking-on-eggshells fragile cover of &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; and the aching &quot;Holocaust&quot; probably say more about the mindset of the band at the time and set the central tone for the album - depression, angst, frustration, fatigue - its all here, and expressed eloquently, sometimes overtly, such as in the seething sarcasm of &quot;Thank You Friends&quot; but oftentimes between the lines, in the music (such as the end to the otherwise perky &quot;O Dana&quot;), and in Chilton's tiny, almost pleading voice.  The complete collapse is in &quot;Kangaroo,&quot; another eerie atmospheric masterpiece.  (Big fans of the band should note this version is magnificently usurped and jubilantly re-born by Jeff Buckley's orgasmic 15-minute cover, released as a B-Side to &quot;So Real&quot;.)Of the bonus tracks, only the cover &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin Goin' On&quot; offends.  The band rocks on the Kinks' &quot;Til The End of The Day&quot;, while the aforementioned &quot;Dream Lover&quot; and &quot;Downs&quot; only take you further and further down melancholy lane.

357,708,B0000009OD,"I wanna say right off the bat that &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; seems like one of the few truly great rock and roll albums, but also that it's greatness has only a little to do with it's songs as pure pop confection.  Don't get me wrong, they're mostly great songs.  The thing that really gets  me, though, is the incredible sense of yearning, desperation and sadness  the songs convey.  In part it has to do with the thin production and Bell's  high, wispy vocals, but deeper down the whole record has an indefinable  redemptive urge that I just can't quantify.  It's the opposite of Big  Star's other 'sucicide' record, the unfinished Sister Lovers.  Where  Chilton's opus of despair rakes the bottom of the barrel with the squalid,  ironic hatred of all the best gutterjunkie rawk'n'roll, I Am the Cosmos  strives for, and fails to achieve spiritual transcendance.  The failure and  the acknowledgement of failure is what gives it power.  There aren't many  rock and roll records that mine such wretched emotional terrain with so  little schtick and pose.  Like, Nick Drake's Five Leaves Left, or Roky  Ericson's &quot;You Don't Love Me Yet&quot;, I Am the Cosmos is really just  the sound of one soul letting you in on what it feels like to hurt - to  hurt selfishly, ceaselessly and absolutely.  It doesn't say &quot;lemme  tell you 'bout the pain&quot;; it seems to almost unconciously bleed the  pain in from around the edges.  That's where the record's sealed, obsessive  brit-pop aspirations come in.  It's ostensibly a pop record, and a pretty  one at that.  It's not supposed to be a painful wallow in the sewers of the  soul...  I dunno who was Big Star's better songwriter and I don't know that  it much matters.  What I do know is that Bell's record, in all it's sad,  hermetic madness, is one of rock's true masterpieces. Let's quickly get the obvious out of the way before we get started: Chris Bell is not Alex Chilton, and I Am the Cosmos isn't Radio City. But then again, it was never meant to be.Chilton may have been the true songwriting genius behind Big Star, may have been The Legend before whom the likes of Paul Westerberg and Gibby Haynes genuflected deferentially. But Bell was no slouch, and in spite of his limitations he pours literally all of himself into this album, channels all of his pain, his frustration, his despair, his very soul (whatever that actually means) into the production of these heart-wrenching songs. And the result is something that is at once brilliant and deeply unsettling.Rarely does one encounter an artist actually willing to strip away the armor, to tear down the trite, glittering veneer of image behind which lesser songwriters perpetually hide, and let himself be truly exposed, to reveal his deepest humiliations, his most embarassing insecurities. This level of profoundly uncomfortable openness is what Bob Dylan strove for with Blood on the Tracks, but even he (understandably) decided he couldn't take the inevitable, tormenting scrutiny and replaced the more personal revelations and agonizing admissions with lighter, sanitized fare (the pretty, mildly melancholic version of ""If You See Her, Say Hello"" on Blood on the Tracks leaves me indifferent, but the stripped-down cut on the first Bootleg Series box set just tears me up inside--on the official release Bob innocuously sings to the new partner of a long-lost love, ""If you're gettin' close to her/Kiss her once for me,"" but on the discarded track the lyric is ""If you're makin' love to her/Kiss her for the kid,"" which is like a bullet to the chest every time I hear it). Even in Big Star, one of the most emotional bands ever, those guys wrote a number of songs behind the facade of adolescent naivety (think ""Thirteen""), allowing them to keep some distance and soften the visceral blow by pretending that they were children still trying to grow up and learn about love (the major exception being the masterpiece Third/Sister Lovers, in which a jaded and cynical but sympathetically fragile Chilton lays everything on the line, although you often have to dig for the sincerity beneath layers of guarded sarcasm and bitter defeatism).But on I Am the Cosmos, Chris Bell conceals nothing. Just listen to the very first line of the album: ""Every night I tell myself, 'I am the cosmos, I am the wind.' But that don't get you back again."" Right out of the gate, and it's almost too much. I first acquired I Am the Cosmos as I was going through a difficult breakup and battling the demons it had conjured, and as a result I realized instantly that Chris Bell had written the most profound and tragic lyric in pop music history, perfectly and succinctly capturing those moments of weakness where you're sitting alone and crying, filled with self-pity and pining after your One True Love who has outgrown you and moved on, and you try to tell yourself that you're better off without her, that you deserve more, that you're the most important thing in your own universe, and then you remember that you'll never again hear her soft voice whispering in your ear or her fingers tenderly caressing your cheek, and your despondence grows as you realize you miss her more than anything, and you try to summon some ounce of strength or sense self-worth just to make it through another night. If I Am the Cosmos lasted a grand total of ten seconds, I'd still say that it was a masterpiece.But the album doesn't end apruptly, and neither do the moments of agonizing catharsis and disquieting pathos. In ""Speed of Sound,"" Bell confesses, ""So you find him attractive/So what if he is?/You'd like some excitement/We could go to St. Kitts/So it goes/On and on/My love grows/And yours is gone."" Have you ever heard anything so pitiful, so sad, so desperate, and so sadly relatable? Or how about this gem: ""Though I know she lies/I can't stay away/Stars would fall from the sky/And I won't forsake you/You've got lust in your heart/What's sad to me/I'll use every line/Anything to make you mine."" I simultaneously envy and pity anyone who can hear these lyrics, sung in Bell's ragged, youthful voice that emphasizes the sense of hopelessness, and not feel deeply moved. In a mere forty minutes, Bell has distilled not only the very essence of heartache and of loss, but also the inevitable resignation, the acknowledgement that, despite all she has put you through, you would still take her back with open arms, would say anything to keep her close to you, no matter how much pride and self-esteem you'd have to sacrifice in the process.The actual music on I Am the Cosmos is good--there are plenty of bright melodies and sparkling guitar hooks, though much of it admittedly sounds like Big Star's mid-level material--but to focus on the musical or purely technical aspects in isolation of the emotional is to miss the point. This is not your typical pop album: You don't listen to it, you experience it, let it wash over you in waves and tug at your aching heart strings. Even if some of the melodies are a little forgettable, the visceral impact will remain with you long after those last acoustic guitar chords have faded into silence. compare this to the dreck alex chilton has wasted his solo career on and tell me again that alex chilton deserves the accolades he has received for his contribution to big star. even though it's just a collection of demos, this is a heck of a lot tighter than the wreck that is sister lovers. Chris Bell did not have the easiest life. He founded Big Star, only to leave the band, eclipsed by Alex Chilton. He believed in Christianity but struggled through life as a musician and with his attraction to men. He was killed in a car accident in 1978. This record really is an experience to listen to. Much like anything by solo John Lennon to Nirvana's In Utero. When I heard this I was angered that he left Big Star. He was rock's Rimbaud and he left us much too soon. Some anxiety is revealed by the nature of this music. I had four sisters who had some friends, but the &#34;sister says I'm no good&#34; idea is like a choice of Adam and Eve or Steve after the changes our culture has gone through. Had it not been my recent infatuation with Big Star, this is a record that I would have never considered.  I've just turned 50 and been a fan all my life of power pop such as Badfinger and Cheap Trick but Big Star was a band I never listened to until recently.  Their first two records are genre defining, and I could not wait to listen to everything I could find recorded by Alex Chilton and Chris Bell.There are several tracks on ""I Am The Cosmos"" that show the talent Chris Bell had- the title track is gorgeous (though I have to admit the Posies covered it better), ""Speed of Sound"", ""Get Away"", "" I Don't Know"" and ""I Got Kinda Lost"" sounds like they would fit well on a Big Star record.  Several other tracks have an early solo John Lennon sound- ""Better Save Yourself"" and ""There Was A Light"".  There are several versions of ""You And Your Sister"" that Bell recorded with Chilton that show how well they sang together.  However, several other tracks on this disc are just plain awful and I wonder why they were included (""Fight At The Table, ""Though I Know She Lies"").  Of note- Chris' brother David Bell has written a brief history in the liner notes of his brother's influences, how he got involved with Alex Chilton and Big Star, his short solo career and his untimely death.Overall I think this is a must have for any fan of Big Star, but it is by no means a classic record. For fans of Big Star, Chris Bell's `I Am the Cosmos' is a must have. Bell writes sugar-sweet love songs (Speed of Sound, You and Your Sister, Thought I Knew Her) with infatuating melodies that stand well against the best of Paul McCartney. Love lost is seldom heard with such despair. Of particular interest, `I Am the Cosmos' overwrites a beautiful melody with some ripping guitar chords emphasizing the composition's aura of futility.The rockers (Get Away, Make a Scene, I Don't Know) remind me not so much of Big Star, but of John Lennon's rebellious Plastic Ono Band period: fiery but chaotic.Those familiar with Big Star songs such as `The Ballad of El Goodo,' My Life Is Right,' Try Again' and `Give Me Another Chance' shouldn't be surprised with Bell's spiritual affirmations. `Better Save Yourself,' Look Up,' and `There Was a Light' clearly seek the heavens for inspiration.I wouldn't rate `I Am the Cosmos' on par with Big Star's first two albums, but Chris Bell's influence on the band's majestic sound is profound. well 'ye olde' power pop lovers -get your head out of the plimsouls shorts and sniff reality - this is very good especially the title track and 'you and your sister', but dismissing alex chilton just betrays your prejudices - I love 'sister lovers' and I love 'like flies on sherbet' - it was mr chiltons edge that gave the band real depth - it's great that bell doesn't do  too much of his robert plant  impression on this record - that's a real step forward from no1 record.I suspect most of you turds probably favour mc cartney over lennon too -'band on the run' - my arse!the shadow I love Big Star, but I never picked this up.  I listened to it for the first time tonight--its too good for words.  Sure--the songs arent as tight as Big Star but no matter.  Maybe Mr Chilton stole everything from Mr Bell or vice versa--regardless it brought chills.  Unbelievable.  Played it twice in a row--that is very rare.  Bittersweet is the only way to describe it. As great as Big Star was, it's sad that neither songwriter was able to put together a decent solo career.  Chris Bell drifted off and was never able to get a record deal (except for one single), while Alex Chilton seemed to take perverse pride in making sloppy, uninspired music.  This CD represents the entirety of Chris Bell's solo work and was released 14 years after his death. It doesn't quite work as an album.  For the most part, the recording quality is somewhere between a demo and a real album, and there is no real progression to the song sequence.  It's just a bunch of Chris Bell songs--some fast ones and some slow ones.There are some very good tunes here, and if you are a serious Big Star fan you will want to own this CD.  And Ryko, as usual, has done a fantastic job with the packaging, which includes several photos of Chris Bell and a long, heartfelt essay by his brother David, summarizing Chris's musical career.  The best songs are ""I Am the Cosmos"" and ""You and Your Sister,"" which made up the single that was released during Chris's lifetime.  Another highlight is the dreamy ""Speed of Sound.""  The acoustic guitar playing on the slow songs is gorgeous throughout.The fast songs, like ""Get Away,"" ""Make a Scene,"" and ""Fight at the Table,"" sound a bit forced.  Bell contributed some great rockers to the first Big Star album, but without a real band to back him up, he sounds a little out of his element on the fast songs here.  His singing is not quite strong enough, maybe because the lyrics are a little too complicated to work in a loud, uptempo setting.The slow songs, on the other hand, are almost TOO personal.  A couple of them mention Jesus or Him with a capital H.  Musically, they are very good, although the Beatles influence can be a bit too heavy, especially on ""There Was A Light,"" which sounds like a slowed-down ""Let It Be.""Ultimately, the title, ""I Am the Cosmos,"" is very fitting, and almost unifies the collection all by itself.  Chris Bell sounds like he's on an island here (or alone on a mountain top, as in the cover photo), but this is more tragic than enlightening.  In songs like ""Better Save Yourself"" and ""There Was A Light,"" he sounds like a man who is fighting his demons--and losing.  The effort is noble, and there are some memorable melodies to be heard here, but it's an uncomfortable album to listen to.  I admire it a lot more than I enjoy it, and it seems that I can only listen to it every two or three years. Several strong tunes, several near-misses.  If you prefer the first Big Star album, you'll find a lot here to like, but ultimately I AM THE COSMOS will leave you wondering what could have been, as Chris Bell had a great album in him.  You'll only find traces of his unrealized potential here.3 1/2 stars and recommended to fans of #1 RECORD. This disc is worth the price of purchase for the liner notes compiled by Chris' brother David alone.  The music, of course, is excellent.As with the three Big Star re-issues which came out at about the same time as this  album, you could comfortably curl up with the liner notes to this CD and a  cup of coffee and drop out for the evening.  The story is tragic - and  leaves you wishing for more.  Unfortunately, this is undoubtedly all you're  going to get.Perhaps that is why I continue to return to this album,  when all the others fade, years after finding it.  I even re-read the liner  notes.No other album in my collection sustains itself like this one. This is a stunning singer-songwriter album.It is a message from the heart and to the heart from a voice and vocals that are from a cosmos outside of our everyday,it is locked deep within our souls and ideas that drive our reason for living.Great praise for making this beautiful piece accessible through the power of needing to see it released to the public. What I really want to say is that while I have always felt that Big Star is one of the most overrated ""unknown"" bands in the history of pop music, I really like this album.  So go figure. Everyone's been saying ""if you like Big Star"" etc, and yet I can't stand that band but this solo lp transcends anything I've heard from BS. Alex Chilton's genius really put Big Star on the map. Sure there was the original vision that Chilton and Bell were going to be a Lennon/McCartney type songwriting team which fizzled after  #1 Record. I have to say that Bell's songs drag the debut down a notch and that's probably my least favorite of the three Big Star albums. &quot;I Am The Cosmos&quot; is an okay single; the rest of this is a haphazard collection of songs Chris Bell recorded over the years, some with little production value that really never quite gels as a cohesive album in the proper sense. The alternate versions flesh it out enough to make it the length of a full length album, rather than purely serving as bonus cuts. As a Big Star fan I bought this out of curiousity, but I'm not all that impressed. Yes Bell is Beatle like, but his songs always seem at a crossroads, where he's torn whether to emulate Lennon or McCartney, and he seems inferior at either. Also many of his songs are a little too lengthy for their own good and tend to wander in search of direction or  a hook. I remain a staunch Chilton fan.I don't think the real glory of Radio City Or Third/Sister Lovers would ever have been achieved with the compromise of having Bell in the group. Many of the songs on this record will remind you of Big Star.  But, you can tell from listening to Bell's style that he was every bit as important a member of the band as Alex Chilton.  Chilton is often seen as the spotlight, but Bell's songs shone just as brightly.  Here on this album, there are no Big Star songs, just Chris Bell solo.  And we lost a great one when we lost him.When I was a teenager (in the early '90s), I first heard the album ""Blood"" from This Mortal Coil.  On it, they cover ""You and Your Sister"" from this album.  I saw that it was written by Chris Bell, but I had yet to learn about Big Star.  Eventually my fanaticism with Paul Westerberg led me to Alex Chilton and company.  I listed to that song over and over again.Now with this Chris Bell release, I can listen to three different versions of it!  And each one is worthwhile.  No overkill, no filler, this is a solid record. What a pity Chris Bell fatally piled up his car in 1978 after giving up on a music industry that did its level best to finish him first because this is all we'll ever get to hear from him. This music is great and it shows Bell maturing as a writer out of Big Star. (I love Big Star, but this music improves on a lot of what Chris was doing there.)The playing is stripped down vintage, not at all dissimilar from the Big Star stuff with loud, crunchy/clean Strats through British valve amps, ringing acoustic six and twelve strings, drums, basses, some boogie piano, a touch of Moog, and lots and lots of harmony vocals. Arrangement is often quite cool, too, with instruments often adding by their restraint or even absence.  The production is similarly vintage with a nice tube-and-tape warmth you really don't hear much of anymore. (If you're looking for crystal clear recording on a '70s low budget recording, look elsewhere.) Alex Chilton's guest vocs on You and Your Sister really work well. Bell's not got Chilton's choir boy voice but has a raw aggression that Chilton frequently lacked (e.g., on Fight at the Table) and can keep a good tune for a ballad when he needs to (Though I Know She Lies). He's no slouch as a guitarist, too, playing better than he did on #1 Record. The comparison of Bell as Lennon to Chilton's McCartney isn't half bad, though for both their writing was rather more Lennon than the sweetness of McCartney.In all, what a loss but at least we've got these songs. An absolute must for Big Star fans. Chris Bell's infamous solo album finally available in a listenable CD format, just barely.The production of these songs is fair, leading to poor. This is no reflection on Chris or his songs, but rather on the recordings themselves.The instruments/vocals sound distant and muffled, while at times Bell's voice comes across as weak and unconvincing.But what of the music itself? Quite interesting actually, sort of like solo Lennon stuff early 70's. Good, solid, tuneful rock. What a terrible waste that Chris didn't stick with B.S. and add these very nice songs to what Chilton was doing and produce two more great albums.Between this and Third/Sister Lovers Bell wins hands down. If you love Big Star like me you will love this.  Chris Bell was one of the true geniuses behind Big Star and it can be heard here.  Heartfelt and honest.  Get it for your own good. Based on the almost mythic reputation of this album by one of the most important members of Big Star, and the fact that I really love a lot of the Big Star songs, I bought this CD expecting something a lot better.  I understand that there is no point in arguing about whether this album is &#34;good&#34; or  not; people have different tastes.  However, these songs all seem uncompelling and poorly produced to me.  Maybe the album is too much a product of its time; perhaps it meant something more significant to those who heard it back in the day.  However, after I received it I listened to the album all the way through once, and can't see myself ever listening to it again. This is an incredible album, and a must have for anyone that remotely enjoyed/enjoys the band, Big Star. Well worth the purchase. Actually despite sounding 'exactly' like John Lennon for a decent shake, it's also amalgamated with the Kinks & fine folky ballads - in many ways it's an improved refinement of the direction to the first Big Star group incarnation.It is 'I am the Cosmos' that completes the mysterious genius that is the Big Star bermuda tri-angle's place in 'popular' music- the other two posts being the successive BS albums (one being an awesome encapsulation of up for it beer drinking take on the world yet radio intentioned tunes being an almost totally obscure commercial flop for what must have been at least modest expectations , & the other being a 'lost' soul searching peerless type of guitar 'power' pop highs & lows which  didn't end up even being released)The songwriting for 'I am the Cosmos' is incredibly good & also has great production, giving it a really layered stylistic sensibility of, & at times deceptively wild, early rock n roll grovin within a more progressive & elaborate song context. Chris Bell was not only very good with the music but with the combination of sound styles also it seems.Some of the songs about Jesus may put listeners off, but are actually part of the charm of the musics' identity.- This review is for the vinyl version of the album - Chris Bell was always the underappreciated half of Big Star - while critics and fans raved over Alex Chilton's intense, brooding pop songs (deservedly so), Chris Bell was somewhat lost in the shuffle.  His songs are often chilling and desperate in the same mold as Chilton, but his voice is not quite as powerful or accessible as Chilton's - which never detracts from the songs.  This CD is a worthy companion to the essential Big Star albums, and fortunately is widely available.  Nothing here approaches the anthemic status of &quot;In The Street&quot; - Bell's one contribution to mainstream culture, from That 70's Show - but the more low key songs make this work well as a cohesive record.Best Tracks:&quot;I Am The Cosmos&quot; - Soul-searching, lonesome, and an all time power pop classic.  Would have sounded just as good on Third/Sister Lovers.&quot;Speed Of Sound&quot; - Runs a little long, but this emotionally fragile tune is one of the best on the CD.&quot;You And Your Sister&quot; - Chilton's backing vocals and the sweeping arrangement make this one of the greatest love songs nobody has ever heard.  Truly a keeper, in any of the 3 versions that appear here (they aren't TOO different, but all worthy).&quot;There Was A Light&quot; - I'd describe this as George Harrison and Mitch Easter jamming on a soul-pop theme. I wonder if many people know how agonizingly cruel and devastating it must have been for Chris Bell to have grown up in the south in the late sixties and know you were a homosexual. I'm sure that fed alot of the true sadness and depression in his songs(and his life).Music was probably one of the few places where he could turn to for somekind of solace and therapy.His songs of lost love weren't because he was ""In love with a Girl"". Having said that he knew how to turn all his emotions into the most beautiful art that anyone who's loved and lost can feel. I'm always surprised that hardly no-one seems to mention what a geat guitar player he was as well as a songwriter,as everything he plays is just so expressive and drives it all along perfectly to a kind of guitar pop heaven.This album is as essential as all the Big Star albums in my opinion. It could almost BE Big Star just without Chilton and a far more rewarding listen than most of the half hearted crap Alex Chilton released in his solo career.I'll be listening to this stuff till the day I die........ I initially wasn't going to buy this new edition of I Am The Cosmos,having finally picked up the original Rykodisc 1 CD release of the albumthat dates back to 1993 and this being a rather pricey Rhino Handmadeedition, but ended up not being able to resist, beingthe massive Big Star and Chris Bell fan that I am, and realizing howmuch extra material was included I realized it was well worth the investmentand so right was I!!  This a simply gorgeous reissue, complete with a lovelybooklet with great rare photos and some nice essays on Chris byhis brother David and other folks, and a run-down of the origins anddifferences in the alternate and demo tracks on disc 2.  Plus I think the wholething sounds even better than the original Ryko album edition,which already sounded fine but this sounds even cleaner and more powerfulof a remaster.I think the whole thing is essential and particularly if you'rea dedicated Big Star and Alex Chilton fan you'll likely want to add this to yourcollection.  I haven't stopped playing it since it arrived and I was alreadyplaying the Ryko CD constantly so it just augments what was already available.I don't have a least favorite song, they're pretty much all great, and the wholething grows on you over time even the alternate versions of tracks like ""Speed of Sound""or ""Fight at the Table"" or ""Better Save Yourself.""Also realized the price isn't that high considering all you're getting and the gorgeouspackaging and loving care with which this reissue was executed.  Hats off to Rhino, Ardent,the Bell family, everyone involved in getting this masterpiece released!  It's becomeone of my most prized possessions in a very short span of time, as with the Big Star box set which is alsoessential as far as I'm concerned.  I also recommend reading Rob Jovanovic'sfantastic book on Big Star as accompaniment to both this and the Big Star catalog,it can only enrich the listening experience that much more. As much as Alex Chilton, it was band founder and creator Chris Bell that made the 70's cult favorites Big Star tick, with his wonderfully meaty rock hooks and somewhat angst-rideen lyrics.  His contributions to their &quot;#1 Record&quot; were gloriously pure Brit-pop songs a la the Kinks, that were updated to fit the mold of Big Star. Alas, Bell's stay in the band would not last long, as Chilton began to assert his dominance. Big Star would be permanently altered by Bell's leaving. So would Bell.The songs that make up Bell's amazing &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; lp are an interesting mix of the glorious and those that needed to be tweaked and polished- much like Big Star itself. Bell's post Big Star life was that of a depressed and confused man. Some have speculated that Bell's sexual orientation was of concern to him in terms of trying to be a macho Brit-pop rocker. Whatever the case, Bell was a man trying to find his own place and voice.These songs reflect his introspective nature well, and while some are more polished than otehrs, the FEEL that the album exudes is palpable. The mix of folksy style tunes with pop tunes that are descendent of those of Badfinger or the Zombies, is balanced well. The sad part is that Bell could have made these tunes 100% gems had be had the chance to do so. Perhaps he would have re-written some of the keys so that he could lower his range some (the monotomy of his high-pitched voice wears on one over time).Complete with the brilliant &quot;I Don't Know,&quot; and the tasty &quot;I Get Kinda Lost,&quot; Bell's lp is a lost gem for the ages. Alas, so is Bell, who died in a car accident. It's hard to know how far Bell would have gone in his career had he lived, but if these songs are of any indication, he would have done well, even if he remained unknown.A brilliant gem. If Big Star's Radio City and #1 Record are five star records, this is four-and-a-half.  The high points are just as high (the title track, You and Your Sister), the weakest tracks maybe a bit weaker.  There is a real melancholy beauty to this music.  It creates its own atmosphere.Liner notes are rarely worth mentioning, but the ones here (by Bell's brother) are fascinating, telling the story of the recording and mixing of these tracks in Europe, including a brief encounter with Paul McCartney at Abbey Road.  Bell's is a sad story in many ways, and his depression is palpable on Cosmos.  One of those artists who was severely underappreciated in his too-short lifetime and still underrated today. Chris Bell was, along with Alex Chilton, one of singer/songwriter/guitarists of the seminal cult band Big Star. He left after the band's first album, the audaciously-named ""#1 Record"", flopped. In the six years he had left to live, he released one single, ""I Am The Cosmos"" with the ""You And Your Sister"" B-side, but continued recording. He died in a motorcycle crash in 1978. Over the next 14 years, his stray recordings were gathered and put out on this 1992 release. There are 12 original songs on the release, with the addition of a slow version of ""I Am The Cosmos"", and country and acoustic versions of ""You And Your Sister."" All of them are good. The two songs from the single also appear on the ""Keep An Eye On The Sky"" Big Star box set; that set also includes a live and a demo version of ""There Was A Light"" from 1973, Chris Bell's version of which appears on this release.The songs are mostly good, and sound very Paul McCartney-esque (Chris apparently once met Sir Paul in France, a truly big star, after Bell's Big Star days were done). The CD opens with its powerful, hoary, spooky title track, then gets into the gloomy, sludgy ""Better Save Yourself."" ""Speed of Sound"" is an acoustic, drumless strummer that sounds like it was lifted right off a Big Star album. Later on there's some light percussion and a really weird keyboard sound. ""Get Away"" is a jaunty rocker with some truly bizarre drumming. ""You And Your Sister"" is a beautiful song, although maybe a bit overproduced with bleating ""woah woah"", and a grinding cello. Happily, the country and acoustic versions delete these, the arrangements getting sparer and sparer as they go along - the acoustic version is the best. ""Make a Scene"" is a groovy, catchy pop-rocker, but a little dull. ""Look Up"" is another cosmic song, full of sweet melodies and light acoustic guitar. ""I Got Kinda Lost"" is a sweet rocker with a good pace and simple lyrics. ""Fight at the Table"" is a groovy rocker with a cool bass sound, juke joint piano, and scorching vocals that roar like Paul McCartney's on ""Oh! Darling."" Ditto for ""I Don't Know"", which sounds like it would have been at home on either of the first two Big Star albums. Closing song ""Though I Know She Lies"" is a sappy tune that, unfortunately, sounds more like the mellowest of Chris DeBurgh ballads (ew[...] Nice solo, at least, and later in the song Bell wrings some powerful emotion out of his sad lyrics. But having this song at the end of the list doesn't sour the album, since tacked onto the end are still the alternate versions of ""I Am The Cosmos"" (which comes in a ""slow"" version - as if it could be any slower than the original) and ""You And Your Sister,"" still the real winners of the release.Other bands have recorded Chris Bell songs, in particular the two from his single; This Mortal Coil recorded both of them, and Pete Yorn and Scarlett Johansson did ""I Am The Cosmos"", but of course none of them sound very good at all, a testament to the strength of the original.

358,711,B0000009OY,"And this has extra tracks on it.  Once these two albums were done they did two more with the same vocalist, and started to tone it down.  It's a shame cuz this stuff is spectacular.  If you like strong guitar with innocent lyrics, often about girls, and if you get your head (ears) around the vocalist who seems quite odd but is forever, the Undertones.  It's like David Thomas of Pere Ubu or Jad Fair of Half Japanese.  If you don't care for any of these 3 vocalists, forget it.  But if you can get on board, it's fantastic.  The energy of the Undertones and their sweetness along with very very strong song writing, makes this album and the s/t one before it work like crazy.  I even like the next two albums but not as much.  And the two or so they've done in later decades with a different vocalist I just can't listen to.  The songs don't seem to be written as strongly and the vocals are just some ordinary guy and somehow it just ain't the Undertones.  This is.  If you like rock, if you like pop, if you like Weezer who also know how to write songs and have pronounced guitars, and they have a pop sensibility tho not as light pop as the Undertones do, this is the band for you.  This is one of the most surprising bands of all time in that they should be too bubble gummy but there is no bubble gum sound.  It's pure innocence.  Look at that album cover.  There's proof they're just simple lads from Ireland.  Their first two albums (this is the second one and it has extra tracks, all of which are great like the album and I think come from 7&#34;s they issued at the time) have stood the test of time remarkably well.  Strong song writing will out and their enthusiasm and strong instrumentation and ernest vocals all make this a joy to listen to.  Become a fan.  If you are, I'm preachin' to the choir and I assume you have this album.  If not I'm flumuxed.  God bless ya kids and God bless the Undertones in particular. Buy this, but only after you buy the band's first album!  As the lead off track indicates, the Undertones did not stray too far from their original formula when they released their second LP.  Power-pop/first wave punk with silly lyrics.  A young Clash with no political agenda?  Good fun all around.  Standout tracks include Theres Goes Norman and My Perfect Cousin (I believe the band's highest charting single). This product, as any of this kind (music), depends on your likes. I love The Undertones, so I love this old recording too; less fresh than Undertones' first LP, it's probably musically more interesting. The only thing about it is about the sound volume itself. This recording sounds really low, someways like those Electra's recording (The Stooges, MC5, etc.) or their traduction into CD, that sounds really low and when someone tries to turn the volume up, the estatic, that uncomfortable buzz, starts sounding as a solid audible background. What could I say? You've Got my Number, Whizz Kids, My Perfect Cousin, There Goes Norman... if you like it, that is... maybe when they remaster it...Try it if you Know first what you are gonna get.By the way, sorry for my 'hispanic' english and enjoy this ""Hypnotised""... well, if you must. This is a good set of Undertones material. Not as raw as their first but not overproduced by any stretch either. A lot of good, short, fun, energetic songs in typical Undertones fashion. My favorites are ""Nine times out of ten"", ""The way girls talk"", and ""Tearproof"", but most all of the songs are good here and you can get a very good feel for their sound by a 30 second sampling.Note to those not familiar with the Undertones: if at first the lead singer's voice is a bit hard to take, give it time, it may grow on you. My tastes in music have been very eclectic, having run the gamut in genres throughout my 25-plus years of collecting music. This LP has always been one of my favorites.I first heard the Undertones ""Hypnotised"" LP shortly after it was released, having been a instant follower of the group after hearing their self-entitled debut LP. My older sister had both LPs, as she was tuned into punk by a local promoter who would bring punk bands to our area. She saw the Undertones perform locally in about 1979. I believe she told me the second floor nearly caved in from the pogo dancing at the venue.I didn't have to ever go to a concert to get caught up in what these guys were laying down for us. It was almost like punk rock meeting bubble gum music, but there's nothing corny about it. It has a sticky sweet and humorous side to it, but the humor is full of the sarcasm you'd expect from the punk rock movement. The guitar is edgy, fast, loud and the drumming drives the beat forward like any early Clash effort. The tunes are catchy and the lead singer Feargel Sharkey's voice is utterly unique.""Hypnotised"" songs revolve around these Irish boys coming of age. It's a retrospective look back for them. I liken it to taking carousel ride at the neighborhood carnival. All the sites and smells of your youth come back to you in one dizzying moment. It's like getting hit with a bucket of teenage angst and the wonder of it all. The first six tracks on this LP are rock solid. I like ""Whizz Kids,"" ""See That Girl,"" and ""There Goes Norman"" the most, but it's tough to forget their cover version of ""Under The Boardwalk"" for me. ""Boys Will Be Boys"" encapsulates the LP's theme. ""My Perfect Cousin"" was an instant classic.Best thing about this CD is that they add some bonus singles to the mix that were never released on any of their LPs. ""You've Got My Number (Why Don't You Use It)"" is one of my absolute favorite tunes by this band. They just threw it on the CD for good measure.","Alternative Rock,New Wave & Post-Punk,British Punk,Punk,Pop,New Wave,Rock,Hardcore & Punk",extra two done two vocalist started tone shame cuz stuff spectacular like strong guitar innocent lyrics often girls get head ears around vocalist seems quite odd forever undertones like david thomas pere ubu jad fair half japanese dont care vocalists forget get board fantastic energy undertones sweetness along strong writing makes one work like crazy even like next two much two theyve done later decades different vocalist cant listen dont seem written strongly vocals ordinary guy somehow aint undertones like rock like pop like weezer also know extra vocalist started tone shame stuff spectacular strong guitar innocent lyrics girls head ears vocalist seems quite odd forever undertones david thomas pere ubu ubu jad jad fair fair half half japanese japanese care vocalists forget board fantastic energy undertones sweetness strong writing work crazy later decades different vocalist listen seem written strongly vocals ordinary ordinary guy guy undertones rock pop know
359,712,B0000009P1,"I often think of The Roches as the female Beatles, not just for their creativity and harmonies but also becuase with 3 voices and 3 songwriters they are as multi-faceted and eclectic.  With that analogy in mind,  &quot;Can We Go Home Now&quot; might be compared to The Beatles'  &quot;White Album&quot;.  While there is less interplay between  &quot;lead&quot; singers and songwriters, the songs are more  straightforward and accessible to non-Roches' fans than in some other  works.  Nonetheless, after 20+ years, The Roches are still able to suprise  me melodically, even though I know to expect the unexpected. Only The  Roches could sing an 8+ minute song about a winter coat and leave you  wanting more when it's over. My favorite sister act of 3 stars always singsand plays like 5 stars. They have their ownstyle with amazing harmonies. My favorite songfrom ""Can We Go Home Now"" is the lengthy song aboutfinally finding the perfect winter coat. I almostlike it as much as their version of Bob Dylan's""Clothesline Saga""...Thanks again for all of theGREAT Roche music! ...it would get five stars.I hate it when the Roches go ""hah-hah-hah"" behind the lead vocal. That's their Partridge Family influence showing, and it compares negatively to the inventive harmonies of their first three records.  But this CD is a good comeback from a few mediocre offerings like ""A Dove"" and their children's stuff. ""Christlike"" is as good as anything they've done. And ""I'm Someone Who Loves You"" is fun (you gotta love the way Suzzy says ""ragdoll"".You can go home, girls. You've done it all. Frankly, I'm shocked that somebody gave this CD only 1 star!!!  I  personally feel that this album is the 2nd best Roches album, second only  to 1989's brilliant &quot;Speak&quot; album.  Who cares if the Roches lost  their hard edge they had in the late seventies and early eighties?  Artists  change and evolve!!!  Their fans should learn to do the same.  The Roches  have never forgotten how to write knock-out songs and to harmonize  brilliantly, which is a rare commodity on other 90's albums by artists who,  like the Roches, began their recording careers in the late seventies.  In  short, CWGHN is a great album.  Don't miss out on this one, either!!! this is overproduced. Agree with the reviewer who singled out ""Christlike"" as the best cut on this. It's produced the way their older stuff was. Less slick, less compressed-sounding...even MP3s of their earlier stuff sounds more three-dimensional somehow. They don't get much better.  I can't believe that at this date you can only buy this as an import.  Beautiful lyrics and music, and ""The Coat"" is priceless.  I saw them live in Dallas in 1989, right after ""Speak,"" and the harmonies were gorgeous.

360,713,B0000009PB,"Songs like ""Half of Everything"",""She's a Girl and I'm a Man"",""Weeping Wine"",""Butterfly"",""You will Never Be No Good"" and ""Are you Ready to be Heartbroken?"" won me over to Lloyd Cole's brand of cynical romanticism (or is it romantic cynicism?). In particular the sweeping grandeur of the string arrangements and melodies on DON'T GET WEIRD ON ME, BABE recalled prime era Jimmy Webb songs for me.This one...well, let's say I don't get that feeling here. There isn't anything on here that really screams ""outtake"" (with the possible exception of the overlong ""Can't Get Arrested"") but all too often it's just a bland middle of the road safeness. The songs are nice while they're playing, but I can't recall them when the disc ends. Even the ones I'm calling ""highlights"" here are merely the CD's better spots not necessarily great music.HIGHLIGHTS:""So You'd like to Save the World"" finds Cole chasing a treehugger type and simultaneously castigating her naivete (""Did you really cry/when you saw the hole in the sky?/Did you really hold your head and hide your eyes?"") and salivating over her body (""So you'd like to free my world/If you can free my inner child then I can free your inhibitions,baby""). ""Love You So What"" finds Cole after he's betrayed his lover and discovered what they say about a woman scorned is the truth. (""you beat me up, you put me down/you're slamming my name all over town/guess i'm big enough to roll with the punches/but you bruise me, you abuse me d**n good"") It's probably the ""poppiest"" song on here thanks to an indelible keyboard riff. The gently loping ""Wild Mushrooms"" is an ode to sex under the influence of less than legal substances, while ""Too Much of a Good Thing"" marries trip hop with country as twangy guitars collide with insistent drum machine high-hat. Here Cole is probably at his most pragmatic romantically. (""If it's good to me/And it's good to you/won't you stay with me/and i will stay with you.."") ""Seen the Future"" is a snide look at trendy musical acts. (""All my friends do the model girl thing/So I found one, now she wears my nose ring.."") ""For the Pleasure of Your Company"" underscores its tale of a flawed man on the make with menacing tremeloed guitars and dramatic martial drum interludes. (NOTE: This song appears only on this U.S. version..the U.K. version omits it and ""4 M.B."")LOWS:""Can't get Arrested"" should have been titled ""Can't Stay Awake"". Way...too...long. There's some nicely bitter words in there about Cole's unknown status in the U.S. but it should have been boiled down to a tasty confection instead of this sprawling Viennese torte of a song.  ""4 M.B."" finds Cole a nonentity in his own song..mixed so low that his muffled whisper quite often is a subtle coloring rather than center of the tune.BOTTOM LINE:Diehard Cole fans may still want to have this one and it does grow on you more with repeat listenings. However, I've owned this one for around 7 years now and it's still far from a favourite of mine. If you're dipping your toes in because of Cole's presence on so many Amazon lists here, make sure that DON'T GET WEIRD ON ME, BABE is your first exposure, not this disc. Definitely a ""hear it first"" CD. I pretty much like all of LC's albums. Some are mellower, some more acoustic, or more strings, or more country, but the lyrics are always funny/biting/sad & his singing is consistently strong.Bad Vibes has some louder guitar, some obvious Beatles/Lennon homages, & the last song is a nice tribute to T. Rex's Marc Bolan.Musically, Bad Vibes is up among his top 5 CD's. If anything, I think the production on his 1st CD has aged the worst, though the songs remain strong.Looking forward to hearing his 2011 CD as soon as it arrives in the mail. No more CD stores in my town...I've seen him solo in the mid-90's, with The Negatives in 2000 & solo again in San Fran in 2009. He's a great performer, & if you get a chance to talk to him, Lloyd is a humble, intelligent gentleman (just as you'd imagine).How he smokes & keeps his voice so smooth is a mystery to me. Bad Vibes starts well with Morning is Broken and So You'd Like to Save the World and ends pretty well with 4 M.B. (one of those ""who's it about?"" songs), but in between there is not much to get excited about.  Call this a tame CD. Very soft arrangements, the usual cynical romantic well-crafted lyrics, all of it with little  staying power in my book.  Sometimes Cole's vocals are so laid back they're barely audible in the already quiet mix.  Can't Get Arrested in particular meanders on entirely too long.  Mister Wrong and My Way to You are the only other cuts I'd consider keepers. Well?  Any one?  I don't get it.  Great album by the way.  One of the best ever made.  Scratches head and smokes a cig.... After DON'T GET WEIRD ON ME, BABE, I honestly felt that Cole was saying goodbye in some strange way...especially with the last song on that album that ended with such bittersweet melodic strings.But, no, he came back!  I remember going to college when this came out; I lived in England at the time, but was going to school in Colorado--hence, my mother in England was able to get me the UK release before a US release available.  She told me the album title and described the cover as ""Lloyd Cole slouched in a corner in a really bad mood.""It sent chills down me and the chills were intensified when the guitar rumbled through me with the opening strains of ""Morning is Broken.""  Following that song is Cole's satirical look towards global problems being treated as ""fads"" in ""So You'd Like To Save The World?""  There's the darkly sexual tone of ""Wild Mushrooms"" amongst other wonderful songs on this album.This album was such a refreshing 180 from DON'T GET WEIRD ON ME, BABE, which was a strange, confused album compared to this straightforward word play observations on self-reflection, relationships, and unabashedly unreserved obsession for a girl with her ""natural grace.""In my mind, there are no bad Lloyd Cole albums (Commotions, solo, or Negatives) -- but this is definitely his best solo album. This seems to be a polarizing album for fans of Lloyd Cole.  This is clearly his most cohesive set of songs since &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot;.  It's simply a question of whether or not you like the left turn he's taking here.&quot;Bad Vibes&quot; is indeed all about mood.  Things aren't going so well in Lloyd Cole's world. In a heart-breaking song near the end of the album, he sings softly &quot;I'm a lonseome alcoholic&quot;, while trying to screw up the courage to ask someone &quot;for the pleasure of your company&quot;.  You get the feeling his potential new lover would be better off staying away from him, and that Lloyd knows it, too.Nevertheless, Cole is a top songwriter and in fine form here. This is Lloyd Cole's soundtrack to falling out of love with his significant other, his own life, and his fellow man. His wry observations and insightful, cutting lyrics are still here, along with that pop sheen all his albums seem to have. This still sounds like a Lloyd Cole CD, just a little darker and more self-lacerating.&quot;So you'd like to save the world?&quot; he asks.  &quot;I suggest you take one person at a time and start with me&quot;.  Get the picture? I'm a huge fan of his most popular solo album ""Don't Get Weird on Me Babe"", but this album is a close second.  If you like Lloyd's vocals, this a wonderful album that grows better with each listen. He's an excellent songwriter and crafts atomospheric tunes mixed in with straight ahead rock n'roll.A very underrated musician and songwriter.  If you like his sound at all, this is a great album to have. Pulled this one out of my collection today (2014) and listened to it for the first time in many, many years.  It's now 20 years old, but I was amazed at how good it sounded and how much I enjoyed hearing it, and not because it was ever one of my real faves back in the day, because I don't recall that it was, and I don't have strong memories associated with this album.  But I am tempted to put this one back on my device in regular rotation with recent purchases, it's an excellent album and sounds to me good as new.","Alternative Rock,Pop,Adult Alternative,Singer-Songwriters,Rock,Folk",like half everything shes girl im man weeping wine butterfly never good ready heartbroken lloyd coles brand cynical romanticism romantic cynicism particular sweeping grandeur string arrangements melodies dont get weird babe recalled prime era jimmy webb one well lets say dont get feeling isnt anything really screams outtake possible exception overlong cant get arrested often bland middle road safeness nice theyre playing cant recall disc ends even ones im calling highlights merely cds better spots necessarily great highlights youd like save world finds cole chasing treehugger type simultaneously castigating naivete really cry saw hole sky really hold head hide like girl man weeping wine butterfly good ready heartbroken lloyd lloyd coles coles brand cynical romanticism romantic cynicism sweeping grandeur string string arrangements arrangements melodies weird babe recalled prime era jimmy lets say feeling really screams outtake possible exception overlong arrested bland middle road safeness nice playing recall disc ends ones calling highlights merely cds better spots necessarily great highlights save world finds cole chasing treehugger type simultaneously castigating naivete really cry saw hole sky really hold head hide
361,714,B0000009PS,"Golden Smog is a supergroup of sorts, whose lineup varies from release to release, including members from The Jayhawks, Wilco, Soul Asylum, Big Star, The Replacements, etc. Song contributed are fresh, often slightly experimental and somewhat off the beaten paths of their ""home"" bands. It's obvious they are having fun, and it's always interesting to hear artists combine their writing and singing talents to see what comes up. Down By the Old Mainstream is a solid album with eclectic contributions from Jeff Tweedy (Wilco), Dan Murphy (Soul Asylum), Gary Louris & Marc Perlman (The Jayhawks), Graig Johnston (Run Westy Run).GENRES: Rock, Mellow Rock.BUY IF YOU LIKE: The bands named above.MUST HEAR TRACKS: ""V,"" ""I'll Fated,"" ""Glad & Sorry,"" ""Walk Where He Walked,"" ""She Don't Have To See You,"" ""Radio King."" Though one might call Golden Smog a supergroup, the fact is that this collaboration is actually the exact opposite.  Depite bringing together a bunch of musicians who have achieved fame in other places, ""Down By the Old Mainstrem"" features them kicking back and having fun without letting individual egos get in the way.  ""Mainstream"" is a particular triumph for the Jayhawk's Gary Louris and Wilco's Jeff Tweedy.  Louris because the style of the album represents a more rocking departure from his usual work and Tweedy because he lightens up like he never has before (or since) in his career.  Tweedy's throaway ode to ""Pecan Pie,"" in fact, is highlighted by the visuals both on the CD booklet and the CD itself.The other highlights include an ace cover of Ronnie Laine's gorgeous ""Glad and Sorry,"" ""Won't Be Coming Home,"" Kraig Johnson's hilarious ""He's a Dick,"" ""Friend,"" the rocking ""Red Headed Stepchild,"" and the fine closer ""Radio King.""  Every song has the kind of loose, devil-may-care feel that is all-too-lacking in much of today's rock music.  In fact, ""Mainstream"" is more fun than the more recent ""Weird Tales,"" from this same bunch.Overall, a rollicking, spirited album showing the playful side of some very fine musicians. People who criticize this album really just don't get it, I'm afraid.  Yeah, the lyrics are kinda silly, and a couple of the songs are throwaways, but what did you expect when you squeeze The Jayhawks, Wilco, Soul Asylum  and Run Westy Run into one band?  If you expected Son Volt, then you're on  the wrong side of the alt-country fence, hombre.  This album is for people  who like Wilco's &quot;A.M.&quot; because Jeff Tweedy sounds like he's  smiling throughout the whole album, and the Jayhawks' &quot;Tomorrow the  Green Grass&quot; because Mark Olson and Gary Louris sound perfect  together. The songs on &quot;Mainstream&quot; don't break any new ground,  but that's not why you like these bands anyway, right?  You like them  because they have a warm, familiar sound that it would be a shame to mess  with.  It's great to hear these bands having such a good time together.  Even if you don't buy into Golden Smog (which would be a shame, because  &quot;Weird Tales&quot; is even better), think of it this way: no Jayhawks  collection is complete without &quot;V,&quot; and if you see Jeff Tweedy at  the Lounge Ax, he's gonna play &quot;Pecan Pie.&quot;  Give this album the  shot it deserves, and Golden Smog might end up knocking these individual  bands out to become your favorite. This album, while not up to the level of the Jayhawks, is great nonetheless.  V and Ill Fated are phenomenal tunes, and there are a bunch more thrown in to boot with minimal trash.  Much like the Jayhawks, the  music grows on you becoming more and more delightful everytime you hear it.  If you only buy one Golden Smog album, make it Weird Tales(an excellent  album on all levels).  If you like that(and you will), come back and buy  Mainstream.  If you like the Jayhawks, buy both and don't look back. A really fun album all around, with great songs, great musicians, and lots of goofiness. Not that it's a sloppy hoo-raw....the songs are very tight and well-constructed, as you would expect from this bunch. But I don't remember hearing a record that sounded so _fun_ to make. And I dare anyone not to be touched by &quot;Williamton Angel&quot;. This was the first full-length Golden Smog album. It was not a planned event; the songs were mostly things that members had cooked up separately or in various pairings. Gary Louris, Marc Perlman, Kraig Johnson and Dan Murphy, all based in the Minneapolis area, had been playing pickup gigs together for some time. Finding themselves with spare time and material, they decided to smog together an album. They invited Jeff Tweedy, recently divorced from Uncle Tupelo, to help make the record.Much of _...Old Mainstream_'s charm lies in its loose, unconcerned vibe. For that same reason, the more heavily-produced and polished followup _Weird Tales_ might be a better starting place. But for of all that album's high points, _Down By the Old Mainstream_ makes for a more consistent listen - the quality is steady throughout, and the songs fit right together. If _Weird Tales_ hits you over the head, this one sneaks up on you - somewhere around the third or fourth listening, right about the time you get to ""Williamton Angel"" or ""Radio King"", you'll be sitting up and saying, ""wow, this is good!"".I had the privlege of seeing these guys play two years ago, and even without Mr. Tweedy, they were awesome. I can't wait for the new album. OK, it doesn't break any new ground. OK, you may not need this to make your cd collection more complete or coherent. But why should yuo care? If you can have this music and listen to talented people with a taste for nostalgia and harmony, why don't you? I can stand to the Jayhawks and Wilco (the other bands I do not know) and it's great fun to listen to. Buy it and warm your heart. OK, it doesn't break any new ground. OK, you may not need this to make your cd collection more complete or coherent. But why should yuo care?

It can stand next to the Jayhawks and Wilco (the other bands I do not know) and it's great fun to listen to. Buy it and warm your heart. As a Jayhawks fan, i just had to buy this album.It's above average in my opinion, with a few stand out songs..and a few &#34;album fillers&#34;.Not a fan of the singer, but overall a good album. This is a good album but by no means a great one. With members from Soul Asylum, Wilco (and incidentially, Uncle Tupelo) and the Jayhawks, the songs evoke each of these bands, but not in the way one might hope. This is one of those albums that's good, until you hear the band's other work and then it's thrown to the bottom of the pile, though it's still pretty darn high on the pile. There are some truly great songs (V, He's Such a Dick, Pecan Pie, Radio King) but there are also many decent but decidedly filler tracks. Down By The Old Mainstream seems to be the bands ""tryout"" album, before they really hit one home with Weird Tales. IF you're a Wilco, Uncle Tupelo, Soul Asylum or Jayhawks fan you probably already have this, but if you're not, get Weird Tales instead. These guys are great. All three of their albums are worth adding to your collection, especially if you are a fan of Buffalo Springfield/Byrds country rock. This album bought me.  I didn't buy it.  I purchased it because of a longing for Uncle Tupelo type music, and being disappointed with Wilco's A.M. (which has grown on me).It's nothing like Uncle Tupelo.  Apples  and Oranges.  What I loved about Anodyne was the sparse, delicate, and  harsh realities it conjured up.  The dark side.  What I love about  &quot;Down By the Old Mainstream&quot; is pretty much the opposite.  For  some albums, the timing has everything to do with it's success, and I think  that the time, or period, in the lives of those who comprise Golden Smog,  was key to it's turn out.  I can listen to this over and over and over  again and never tire of it.  I actually like this one a little better than  Weird Tales, because it seems to encapsulate such a good time.","Alternative Rock,Country Rock,Americana,Country,Pop,Adult Alternative,Rock,Classic Rock",golden smog supergroup sorts whose lineup varies release release including members jayhawks wilco soul asylum big star replacements etc contributed fresh often slightly experimental somewhat beaten paths home bands obvious fun always interesting hear artists combine writing singing talents see comes old mainstream solid eclectic contributions jeff tweedy wilco dan murphy soul asylum gary louris marc perlman jayhawks graig johnston run westy run genres rock mellow rock buy like bands named must hear v ill fated glad sorry walk walked dont see radio king though one might call golden smog supergroup fact collaboration actually exact opposite depite bringing together bunch musicians achieved fame places old mainstrem features kicki golden golden smog smog supergroup sorts lineup varies release release including members jayhawks soul soul asylum asylum big star star replacements contributed fresh slightly experimental somewhat beaten paths home bands obvious fun interesting hear artists combine writing singing talents see comes old mainstream solid eclectic contributions jeff tweedy wilco dan dan murphy murphy soul soul asylum asylum gary louris marc jayhawks johnston run westy run genres rock mellow mellow rock rock buy bands hear ill fated glad sorry walk walked see radio king one call golden golden smog smog supergroup fact collaboration actually exact opposite bringing bunch musicians achieved fame places old features
362,716,B0000009Q4,"Based on what I'd heard and read about this record, I was expecting something really special. But unfortunately, this comes off as pretty tepid early ""alternative/college rock."" It reminds me of stuff like Gang of Four, the Minutemen, a less abrasive Saccharine Trust etc. In 1981 this might have stood out. Today it just sounds dated. To me, truly classic music doesn't ever sound dated... or at least not to this degree. You can find great music from any period and era that sounds fresh decades later. That doesn't describe this, unfortunately. This is my favorite MoB album.  In fact, it has what I consider one of the best songs ever written on it: Max Ernst.  After having it on album in the 80's, I picked this up on CD a few years ago and listened to it again.  Some have said it sounds dated.  Yes, it does.  But so do The Strokes, White Stripes, The Hives, The Vines, and most other bands out there.  At least MoB actually sound like the period they're from.  And I'm not knocking all the above mentioned bands, I'm just pointing out that it shouldn't be maligned because it sounds like the era its from.That's When I Reach for My Revolver is a fantastic song.  But the whole album is great.  I've been listening to it again consistantly for about 5 years now -- and that's something I never do.  It's in my top five albums of the 80's and would be one I carted off to a desert island. okay, I picked this up mainly from hearing that fugazi was influenced by this band and because of the book Our Band Could Be Your Life.  I am incredibly pleased that I bought this album.  Each song is complex and dense, especially songs like Red and Max Ernst.  The guitar, bass, and especially drum playing is really really well done and original. here is a synopsis of each song:Thats When I Reach for my Revolver- awesome song, great lyrics, one of their poppiest tunes, but still rather good.  Its just like Roger Miller said, every song Clint writes he has to include a bass solo. one of the funner songs on the albumOutlaw- straight out of the Gang of Four Bag O' Tricks, this song takes a few listens to appreciate. it is sorta danceable (!) and much better than some Franz Ferdinand songs.Fame and Fortune- Roger's attempt of writing a commercial song, but still rather good. a highlight, but sadly I havent listened to this album in awhile, so I cant say too much about it.  Pretty catchy and strongThis Is Not A Photograph- great song, the cries of &quot;this is not a photograph&quot; is one of the hooks in this song, and its got a few. I like the guitar work.Red- My favorite lyrics from this EP. great tune...I need to listen to it again.All World's Cowboy Romance (is that the right title?)- Fun instrumental.  I like it when it starts to get really noisyAcademy Fight Song- another one of those &quot;hits&quot; that wasnt actually a hit.  their catchiest song, with layers upon layers of guitar.  How can you not sing along in the chorus?Max Ernst- My favorite song off of this.  For me, its like their punk song, but its also got experimental stuff, like the weird timed breakdown and the yells of dada. great tune.I probably should have written this review after listening to this album again, but overall I believe if you know of this album, you are going to buy it. great stuff. I first encountered Burma on the radio; ""Academy fight Song"" and ""Revolver"" were actually ""hits"" on a major Boston radio station -- this being waaay back in the day before Clearchannel bought up everything and radio became the same sucky suck on every channel. Good catchy punk songs, they grab you quickly. (Though ""Academy"" really reveals its multi-tracked mystery in headphones...) It wasn't till some time later, coming down on clear MIT-blotter acid one misty dawn, that I heard ""Signals, Calls, and Marches"" in full, but when i did, it completely redefined what I thought was possible with a guitar, a bass, and some drums. (And tape loops, aaah, the tape loops...) ""Revolver"" pulls you in with its angular intensity, shakes you around (""and now the sky is empty, but that is nothing new...""), then leaves you hanging on this melancholy chord, which --before you ever have time to process it-- has Peter Prescott pushing you with his kick drum into ""Outlaw"", which kicks in with a jagged, ideologically choppy riff. ""Fame and Fortune"" rolls in on an epic, moody wave, and build in intensity before crashing into this haunting, spacious breakdown that has Roger pulling all sorts of sounds out of his guitar. And for two guys who never really put technique before passion in their vocals, Roger & Clint always come up with these rough harmonies that seem all the more effective for rising out of a sea of noise. (Something Husker Du would later take to the bank...) Side 2 (oops, showing my age) kicks off with ""This Is Not A Photograph"" which features Dada-esque lyrics, an absolutely PRIMAL riff, and some sicksickSICK slide guitar plunges from Roger.  ""Red"" is a journey through all sorts of terrain; ""there's a window in my head"", don't you know it. This one starts off thrashing, and dissolves into this abstract chaos, a looping octave-jumping bassline with a completely note-free guitar-solo, and swirling loops of vocal madness that just take this BEYOND. Then it all comes down with the chiming, double-guitar chords of ""All World Cowboy Romance"", perhaps Burma's most melodic track, and all without a vocal (except for their trademark ""oohs"" in the background...) Rhytmically, structurally, tonally, lyrically, this band was capable of  stuff I haven't heard anyone equal since. (OK, well UZI and early Sonic Youth came close.) But with this band, it all came down to an indefinable mad passion and intensity, and that comes across clearly on this record. I remember deciding to listen to this every day for 100 days straight, and I did, because I wasn't sure I'd ever hear anything as good and I wanted to savor this album, to burn it into my brain so deeply that it would cut the grooves on the grey matter. To this day, I can hear this album note for note in my head, and that's an intimacy I have declined to share with any other record. I had a chance to see Burma live in Lawrence Kansas, best live show I've ever seen and have been hooked ever since. Legend has it that the photo of Clint Connely holding the burma sign on the horriblr truth LP was taken at  that Lawrence show. I wonder if that's true? One of the first CDs I bought was Rykodisc's 1987 MoB complete compilation; it was at the time the longest CD yet issued! The sound on that, I thought, could not be bettered, but after waiting a while to buy the remastered EP, this is not a cash-in job simply getting you to pay for the album again in (for me) its third form (counting my vinyl). I tend not to 'upgrade' a CD unless absolutely convinced it's one needing improvement. On this, I admit I gambled. I thought MoB sounded fine on that pioneering CD, but this re-issue nearly a decade later shows the sound's tighter and ratcheted up a bit more in intensity.Which is saying a lot for MoB. The first four songs stand here as one of the most powerful post-punk statements ever recorded. The next eight (two--which were a single--are added to the original six). Why four stars? Well, I never liked ""Academy Fight Song,"" but even its clunkiness sounds passable here--it's in a better place following the EP as it was meant to be heard; the 1987 chronologically ordered compilation began with ""AFS,"" but I think it's moved better as a footnote than title header, so to speak.For a young band's first recorded songs, these show maturity in lyrical ambition (if a bit too strained into prep school self-consciously alienated smarts on the two single songs), precise musical arrangements, and three singer-songwriters in training. It sounds spacious yet coiled, and prepares you for their triumph, ""VS."" as more than a warm-up. (I might add that while their reunion ""Off/On"" nearly matched ""VS."", that their third album, this year's ""The Obliterati"" (great multi-level pun) may even surpass ""VS."" in its formidable stature. This EP shows that the band had what it takes for the long haul, then and now. It comes out roaring, and combines brains with brawn in a way few ""college radio/alternative"" bands of the era have managed to come close to. I don't think any American post-punk band on an early 80s debut surpassed this EP. I'm a big fan of postpunk, and this album is one of the shining gems of the genre.  Bands were taking to heart the freedom that punk rock offered and taking the music to a new place.  Burma were the voice of America in a postpunk world dominated by Wire, Gang of Four, Joy Division, Bauhaus, Killing Joke, et al.  If you like any of these bands, or are interested in this incredibly vital period in rock music,  Mission of Burma is necessary to your life.  'That's When I Reach for My Revolver', 'Academy Fight Song', and 'This is not a Photograph' are probably the best three songs to start your Burma fascination, and they're all on this album. This is an interesting, exciting, and disapointing CD of singles from MISSION of BURMA.  This collection titled SIGNALS, CALLS, and MARCHES is as slip-shod as the underachieving career of this exciting and influential band.  As a reissue, it presents the songs vividly and remastered.  The songs capture the driving energy of East-Coast US Post-Punk.  TWIRFMR is a prime example of the best. The lyrics are a poignant appraisal of punk's manifesto.  &quot;Once I had my heroes / Once I had my dreams / But all that is changed now / The truth begins, again / The truth is not that comfortable&quot;  F&amp;F is another fine example : &quot;Try to catch a falling star / Crush it into dust / Stuff it into a jar / and throw it far away &quot;.  Musically, the song couragously collapses into a whimper and recovers with a strong finish.  Few bands of any period pull off a song like F&amp;F as successfully.  At the same time, what did MoB do with this talent if not crush it and throw it far away?  Why should I care two decades later?  This collection does nothing to motivate a new listener.  It is not enough that Mr Richard Hall (aka Moby) enjoyed MoB while growing up in Connecticut.  Like the band this collection is a disappointment of underperformance. I never get tired of this album. The music is filled with restless energy, the lyrics evoke a kind of dreamy stream-of-consiousness, and the production is astounding. It takes several listens (with headphones) to &quot;get&quot; all that is happening.Obvious standouts are &quot;That's When I Reach For My Revolver,&quot; &quot;Red,&quot; and the added single and its' b-side. The influence this cd has had on more recent artists is apparent, and very disappointing. Nothing this good will EVER be made again, we don't need 5th rate Mission Of Burma impersonators running around (are you reading, Mike Stipe??????). But enough. Buy the cd, you won't be sorry! (however, I'd avoid the followup, Vs. There is no possible way they could have succeded at ANYTHING after creating anything this powerful!) A truly historic band, Mission of Burma challenged not merely the status quo of the mid 80's punk/hardcore, but the very constraints of BLAH BLAH BLAH - if you want a an overwrought, spin-filled history of MoB, go read Pitchfork or SPIN. This is a great CD with most of the band's ""hits"" (ha!) and is probably the best introduction to the band for new listeners. Plus, it has the amazing Academy Fight Song b-side from the Max Ernst 7"". I can't pigeonhole their sound to any specific genre, but it has as much in common with Gang Green as it does Gang of Four. The songs have intelligent lyrics, complex structures, catchy riffs, hummable choruses, and whether you're a punk looking for something a cut above the average 80's Boston hardcore, a hipster riding their reunion buzz or just looking for some great, timeless music, you really can't go wrong with Mission of Burma. When I want to show someone where the Burma experience began for me I will put this Ep on the turntable. Granted That's When I Reach for My Revolver is the standout track, the nature of the format dictates that featured  tracks often eclipse the others on a great many Eps &amp; singles. Perhaps  self-consciously avante-garde tracks like This Is Not a Photograph or Max  Ernst seem out of place. Max Ernst was a holdover from the pre-Burma band  The Moving Parts and Photograph had been refined to such a degree that this  version would effectively supplant the earlier version in the minds of all  but the completist. How about  All World Cowboy Romance, an irresistably  silly title behind which a layered and cunning beauty resides. All of that  said, if you haven't already purchased VS. (not to be confused with the  Pearl Jam album of the same name)  then do so without delay. VS. is where  anyone interested in Burma should start. Nothing can prepare you. No amount  of listening to early glories such as Academy Fight Song (not on Signals,  Calls and Marches Ep originally anyway) will come close, so few records  have. This endlessly inventive, humorous, passionate and influential  collection will stand on its own merits with or without critical acclaim.  Like a &quot;..mineral deposit, a ball of mica, inside a rock.&quot;!  There is no non-essential Mission of Burma. I have it on vinyl; I was listening to it back in the day.  It's okay, mildly interesting aggressive arty &quot;alternative&quot; rock.  The following LP, &quot;Vs.&quot;, is more substantial.  Best track here is &quot;All World Cowboy Romance&quot;, but even that track is fairly dispensible connect-the-dots stuff. A crystalline distillation of everything that was Boston's MOB.  Grrrrrrr-eat songs like ""This Is Not A Photograph"" and ""Acadamy Fight Song"" punctuated with Roger Miller's twisting guitar.  This is an envigorating listen, right up there with ""Spiral Scratch."" This is one of those bands that causes everyone to retell the old chestnut about the Velvet Underground: &quot;Only X amount of people bought their record, but those that did went out and formed a band&quot;.  Not hard to see why here.  This EP contains the first offical recordings done by MOB.  They are at their most accesible here, with &quot;Academy Fight Song&quot; and &quot;That's When I Reach For My Revolver&quot;.  Once you get this and enjoy it, move onto their only album from the early years - &quot;Vs.&quot;  It only gets better.  Their recent reformation yielded another album &quot;Onoffon&quot; - another worthy addition to their legacy.","Alternative Rock,New Wave & Post-Punk,American Punk,Indie Rock,Indie & Lo-Fi,Punk,Pop,Post-Punk,Rock,Hardcore & Punk",based id heard read record expecting something really special unfortunately comes pretty tepid early alternative college rock reminds stuff like gang four minutemen less abrasive saccharine trust etc might stood today sounds dated truly classic doesnt ever sound dated least degree find great period era sounds fresh decades later doesnt describe unfortunately favorite mob fact consider one best ever written max ernst picked cd years ago listened said sounds dated yes strokes white stripes hives vines bands least mob actually sound like period theyre im knocking mentioned bands im pointing shou based heard read record expecting really special unfortunately comes pretty tepid early alternative alternative college college college rock rock reminds stuff gang minutemen abrasive saccharine saccharine trust trust stood today sounds dated truly classic sound dated degree find great period era sounds fresh decades later describe unfortunately favorite mob fact consider best written max max ernst ernst picked cd years years ago listened said sounds dated strokes white white stripes stripes hives vines bands mob actually sound like period knocking mentioned bands pointing shou
363,717,B0000009Q6,"Don't let any negative reviews scare you away:  If you really want to know what Mission of Burma were about Back In The Day, look no further: The Horrible Truth perfectly captures the brilliant, brutal fury of this hugely influential band at their very peak.Guitarist Roger Miller often said that the reason Vs., Burma's widely acclaimed studio masterpiece, so eclipsed their earlier studio efforts was the fact that Vs. was essentially recorded live in the studio.  By extrapolation then, ""The Horrible Truth"" is an even more significant recording than Vs., because it captures all the immediacy and rawness of Burma in an actual live setting.That Burma was/is really a live band, and not creatures of the studio, is an important point.  Every twist and wierd effect you hear on Vs. can be -- and was in fact intended to be -- reproduced in real time in a live setting. If you have been lucky enough to catch Burma live, you will know I do not exaggerate when I say that their live shows blow away anything they've recorded in the studio -- with perhaps the exception of The Horrible Truth.So what you get here are roaring, sizzling, edgy performances -- especially ""Tremelo"", ""1970"" and the jaw-dropping Pere Ubu cover, ""Heart Of Darkness"" -- albeit with a slightly less refined mix than what one would expect from a studio recording like Vs.  But make no mistake:  this is essential Burma. This album is a real nostalgia trip for me. I became aquainted with Mission of Burma as a student in Boston in 1979. It was a time of great creative ferment in the avant-garde scene, both in jazz and in rock. MOB blew me away when I first heard Revolver on WBCN. I followed the band as much as I could at the time, and continued to be interested in Roger Miller's followup band Birdsongs of the Mesozoic. But MOB had it all. It had the raw rage of British punk, but the experimental attitude of other avant-rock groups like Pere Ubu, who are their most clear forebears. And the lyrics were smart...this was college student's punk.This album captures much of the energy of that period. The cuts include the biggest hit, Revolver, along with numbers from Vs., MOB's strongest work, and other cuts that never made it to wax during the band's lifetime. The playing on the album is white hot, and Mike Swope's tape loop work is even more creative than on the studio work. And the more atmospheric work is prescient of the electronic ambient music of the later 80s and 90s. And though there is the requiset thrash and slash on the album, the writing and playing is excellent. These aren't guys who just learned to play their instruments, they are true creative musicians.One big problem with the album however is the recorded sound. Though not bad for music recorded in small bars around the country, it is still kind of muddy and at times, the instruments overpower the singing. MOB shouted with the best of the punkers, but you could usually hear them over the din. That's not always the case here and you loose something by not hearing all the lyrics.All in all though, this is one of the best underground bands of the early 80s. It amazes me that it still sounds fresh, even after 20 years (though I suppose I shouldn't be amazed since the Velvet Underground still sounds fresh as well and it's been 40 years for them!) So many bands in the late 90s and today seem to think that they've invented punk attitude. MOB has them all down cold. Hey is that other message from Martin Swope? Tape god extrordinaire? First, I implore you to ignore abrasive, mediocre reviews.  This, a document of the final tour by a band gone WAY before their time, is wonderful.A live album can be a tricky thing, but Burma delivered onstage &amp; that is captured to good effect here.  Cover songs are monsters (Stooges &amp; Pere Ubu) and originals are given that extra kick (Peking Spring ROCKS).  Martin Swope in particular is revealed here as a fuller collaborator that on the studio albums, tweaking, spindling, folding &amp; mutilating chunks of the band' playing &amp; sending them back though the sound system in realtime via analog tape loops, way before any samplers were around.  Fine stuff from a band having one last blast of decibels before hanging it up. Abrasive, mediocre live recording by the band that cut the brilliant &quot;Vs.&quot;.","Alternative Rock,New Wave & Post-Punk,American Punk,Indie Rock,Indie & Lo-Fi,Punk,Pop,Post-Punk,Rock,Hardcore & Punk",dont let negative reviews scare away really want know mission burma back day look horrible truth perfectly captures brilliant brutal fury hugely influential band peak guitarist roger miller often said reason vs burmas widely acclaimed studio masterpiece eclipsed earlier studio efforts fact vs essentially recorded live studio extrapolation horrible truth even significant recording vs captures immediacy rawness burma actual live setting burma really live band creatures studio important point every twist wierd effect hear vs fact intended reproduced real time live setting lucky enough catch burma live know exaggerate say live shows blow away anything theyve recorded let negative reviews scare scare away away really want know mission burma day look horrible truth perfectly captures brilliant brutal fury hugely influential band peak guitarist roger roger miller miller said reason burmas widely acclaimed studio masterpiece eclipsed earlier studio efforts fact essentially recorded live studio extrapolation horrible truth significant recording captures immediacy rawness burma actual live setting burma really live live band band creatures studio important point twist effect hear fact intended reproduced real real time time live setting lucky catch burma live know exaggerate say live live shows shows blow blow away away recorded
364,718,B0000009RP,"The band has had numerous compilations over the years, but this one definitely had the most effort put into it. The songs are more or less in reverse chronological order, letting you hear how their diverse sounds have changed over the years. The first CD (""Unum"") covers 1981-96, while the second CD (""Pluribus"") covers the ""Classic"" album years of 1980-1972. One thing that makes this particlar compilations special are the several ""concentrates"" -- medlies created from several or all songs from a particular album.  They concentrates aren't just space fillers though; they flow really well for the albums they were selected for.Even if you do have most of the major releases from The Residents, this compilation includes a good number of rarities and general non-album songs. You don't have to get them just for the sake of completion though: in all honesty, they're really good songs!  The booklet was also very well done, including an informative biography, tons of great photos, and track-by-track descriptions of the songs and their sources.  The booklet has two cover photos, so you can display either one on the front by flippling the booklet over.There was also a 4-CD version of this release, but I don't think it's still in print. It included everything from the 2-CD version, plus tons of more rarities, and more concentrates for albums not covered at all in the 2-CD release (Meet The Residents, Not Available, the albums for the Cube E and Mark of the Mole tours, the Hunters soundtrack, etc.)  So for those of you wondering ""why didn't they include material from album so-and-so"", that's the reason why.This is the very first release I ever bought from The Residents. Music has always been one of my passions, but just when I thought I had heard every style and genre, The Residents came into my life and turned my perceptions upside-down. They're incredibly weird and dissonant at a first listen, but once you aquire the taste...wow, you can't get enough. This stuff is absolutely SUBLIME!!!! We have a saying in Spanish: &quot;Zapatero a su zapato&quot; (&quot;The shoemaker to his shoes&quot;) that applies to the marvelously underappreciated Residents... Radiohead should stick to their wonderfully challenging Rock 'N Roll and should leave the avant-garde deconstruction to people like The Residents. Don't buy &quot;Kid A&quot;...(see my review for that album)...BUY THIS, INSTEAD!!! It's been ten months since I bought this CD set, and I still listen to it weekly.  Yes, I am the guy who used to sit in the unlit recording booth at my college radio station with Tubular Bells on the speakers, freaking out anybody who walked in, so you get an idea about my personal likes.  This CD, however, still gets to me.  It's disturbing, as the Residents are at their best.  The concentrated versions of Gingerbread Man, Have a Bad Day and The Third Reich and Roll are enough to make me long for the full CDs, and if I have any regrets in the package, it's that there isn't  music from The Mole Trilogy (uncompleted) and that Santa Dog (spoken about at great length in the liner notes) is not included.  I also recommend the DVD Icky Flix by the Residents for a visual version of some of this Double CD.  It's the kind of DVD I'd put on in the broadcast booth of a cable station and watch in the dark, creeping out anybody who happens to walk in. While I have enjoyed several of the other works by the Residents.  This collection has a few tracks on disk one and a couple on disk two that stand out for me. The rest of the work reminded me of a free form jam session at a Dead concert.  For me the money spent was not a good value. Most of the tracks that stand out are on disks that you would find on recommendation lists.  So I paid about $4 per track of music, that I would listen to on an MP3 player.  If you have very little of the bands music you should find about 6 or 7 tracks that you will want to repeatedly listen to.  If you find less then that, this music just isn't your cup of tea. The residents find themeselves 25 years in the making w/ this release. A collective work from the early seventies to the present. They work at breaking down standards of media uses and have been very important figures in the re-invention of music video, live theatre, and most recently cd-rom. The main thing I like about this band of eye-balled freaks is that their music has greatly improved with age. They are watching somewhere even now with their bulbous eye-balled heads! This is a great compilation of the Residents. It has in my opinion, a representation of a hit/s from everyone of their albums up to the point of this compilation. It includes 10 of the 1 minute jingles from the Commercial album. One of my favorites ""SKINNY"" from the album Duckstab is also here. Other standouts include ""IT'S A MAN'S WORLD"", ""THIRD REICH AND ROLL"", ""WEED"", and ""CONSTANTINOPLE"". The music is weird,fun,synth-laden and deconstructed 60's pop with a punk edge. The Residents sound like no other band and their the pioneers of this genere-whatever it may be called. I like how they've kept their anonimity with their eyeball heads/masks(on their later albums) and top hat and tails attire. What's truly great about these two guys (for they are two guys), is that they are weird without being violent, angry, or in bad taste. What sets them apart from other weird-band wannabes is that once you get beyond the  weirdness, it's really quite beautiful music. They aren't weird for weird  sake. I listen to the Residents when I want to be rebellious and  &quot;apart&quot;, but still love life. Their music will survive the ages,  while most other avant-garde pop will die out for not being musically  satisfying. A tolerable Rezzies collection.  The fact of the Residents is they really only sound great some of the time.  Some of the rest of the time they are kinda conceptually innarestin, but there are bog stretches when they ain't nmothing but indulgent whine.  No matter whatyou may have heard, that's it.  When they are real good, they're pretty good.  When they're just OK,t hey ain't much.  3rd ReichnRoll is a classic till you burn out on it; its something worth having.  A few 45s  are Ok ; the only thing by them I still have is the Satisfaction single.  Eskimo is actually fairly bonafide and keepable; cut and all but a good effort.  Mole stuff a little less so but not so bad.  Most everything else they did is at least 50%con.  Oh yeah, Duck Stab is part of that original batch - its real precious but they put a lot of effort into it, enough to keep it on th shelf.  True art farts and techno queers, the Rezzies only go downhill from there, which is about 1984 on down.  This is a tolerable map of a tolerable art act. You could so worse and you could have an even moe interesting life without ever hearing the Residents, unless the skillfully marketed plastic fruits of arty farrty rock are what purples your passion. p.s. like the mothers, the original stuff includes other people who make the records walk and talk ;  once the main guys run them off its gets crummy fast, ala the mothers of invention w/out the real mothers There are a lot of highly talented musicians, thousands actually, in the recording industry today, posessing great gifts, skills, chops, senses of pitch, manual precision, on-tune voices, professionality ..... and we have to ask ourselves: just what are they doing with it?Answer: pretty much what they've always done.  The same as each other, with occasional attempts to do it better.Then you have The Residents.  No one knows who they are so much as what they are, a collective consciousness that produces recordings and media quite unlike anyone else.  Their musical chops may not be the most highly competent, but that's not the point.  The point is, once you've heard the music of The Residents, you don't forget it.  They have created their own classification, one I like to call &quot;Techno-Naiive&quot;, a very raw, phonetic, intuitive impression of the art we call &quot;music&quot;, and have invited us to view it with all the wide-eyed wonderment of discovering it for the first time.I haven't heard this collection, and don't really need to.  Most of it I have on the albums the material is from.  It seems to be a good sampling for the curious beginner - a first listening of any of their recordings should determine whether one loves or hates them.  Imagine a small group of marginally talented performers producing the most determinedly disturbing recordings they can, unleashing them on an unsuspecting public, and doing it for nearly 30 years under a strict veil of anonymity, and you have The Residents.  Imagine (if you can) the ultimate alternative to so-called &quot;Alternative&quot; music, and once again, you have The Residents.When you are fed up with everything else .... thank God, you ALWAYS have The Residents.  Help yourself to this appetizer, and if it digests well, go for the feast.  Bon appetit! If you are a fan of The Residents, as I am, this is an excellent compilation.  If you want to meet The Residents, this might be the only compliation you'll ever need.","Alternative Rock,New Wave & Post-Punk,Progressive,Jazz,Special Interest,Pop,Post-Punk,Rock,Hardcore & Punk,Progressive Rock,Avant Garde & Free Jazz",band numerous compilations years one definitely effort put less reverse chronological order letting hear diverse sounds changed years first cd unum covers second cd pluribus covers classic years one thing makes particlar compilations special several concentrates medlies created several particular concentrates arent space fillers though flow really well selected even major releases residents compilation includes good number rarities general non dont get sake completion though honesty theyre really good booklet also well done including informative biography tons great photos descriptions sources bo band numerous compilations years definitely effort reverse chronological chronological order order letting hear diverse sounds changed years cd covers second cd pluribus covers classic years compilations special concentrates created concentrates space fillers flow really selected major releases residents compilation includes good number rarities general sake completion honesty really good booklet including informative biography tons great photos descriptions sources

366,722,B0000009UN,"Have been looking for this cd to replace a tape I had gotten years ago.Love the music and this is a great one. This is an awesome album, they rock very hard, highly venerable band from the U.K.... I discovered The Soft Boys while tracing the musical legacy of Syd Barrett, the original lead creative force of Pink Floyd. Syd Barrett is one of my favorite rock musicians of all time, and his influence on this band is very apparent, both musically and in spirit. Like Barrett's work, the music on A Can of Bees is at once friendly and endearing, and mischievously irreverent, with an underlying &#34;screwed-up&#34; quality.Leppo & The Jooves should have been their breakout hit, but the quirky, offbeat nature of this album has proven somewhat alienating to general audiences. The first seven tracks of the original album are absolute treasures, culminating in the ludicrous Sandra's Having Her Brain Out, my personal favorite. The quality of songwriting drops off quite noticeably after that, as if the band simply ran out of grade-A material, but with the 9 bonus tracks included with the digital album, there is at least one full album's worth of a truly unforgettable classic (and even the lesser songs aren't bad). The Soft Boys debut A Can Of Bees is the easily the hardest albumin Hitchcock's career. It's a genuinely weird record from the school of Beefheart. ""Sandra's Having Her Brain Out"",""Fatman's Son"", ""The Return Of The Sacred Crab"", ""The Pigworker"" and ""Do The Chisel"" are all original, angular power pop.""Human Music"" sees Robyn's first great song.Great four-part harmonies, intricate arrangements and greatjarring pop. Great guitar interplay betweenRew and Hitchcock. Crazy harmonica parts via Jim Melton.All-in-all a great debut from a hugely influental band. I bought this album simply to complete my Soft Boys collection - the painfully high price had kept me away for long enough, and I finally gave in.  And it does not disappoint.  If you love The Soft Boys, and if you enjoy Hitchcock's absurd lyrics, this is worth the price.  ""Sandra's Having Her Brains Out"" is such a great song - heavier than most of Robyn's material, with delightful variances in the feel and texture throughout the song.  ""Human Music"" is a softer song, which is lyrically and musically much more mature feeling than many of the other tracks on this album - a great song which really foreshadows much of Hitchock's music to come.  Other favorites for this disc include ""Leppo and the Jooves,"" along with ""Skool Dinner Blues"" which never fails to get me dancing or at the very least toe tapping.  The Soft Boys harmonies are always lovely, and this first album really puts them to good use.  For anyone else who, like me, shies away from buying this because of price and only OK reviews, just GO FOR IT.  It's really very good.  Hell, I even enjoy the live bonus material... a lot!  It's not Underwater Moonlight, but really, nothing is up to that standard. I ordered this along with the YepRoc vinyl reissue of UNDERWATER MOONLIGHT.  I've been a Soft Boys/Hitchcock fan for many years and have never had the chance to enjoy these masterworks on vinyl, much less in a restored/remastered form, so these were quite welcome additions to my vinyl collection.  The packaging, pressing and added value material (i. e. downloads) from YepRoc are first-rate, as usual. The release history of this album is quite patchy - over the years there have been several variations with numerous track listings and sequences.  Here, much to my delight, the album is restored to its original state in terms of track selection and sequencing. Apparently, this LP was mastered from an original vinyl pressing as the master tape is MIA and the DAT from which the Ryko CD was mastered was deemed substandard.  In many cases of vinyl mastered from vinyl, the sonic results range from disappointing to maddening.  In this case, the results are nothing short of miraculous. Considering the technology of the time, the Ryko CD (mastered from a DAT of the original analog master) sounds pretty decent (I've also heard a UK CD on Armageddon that sounds like it was dubbed from a worn-out cassette). The YepRoc vinyl has an in-your-face quality (in a good way) that the Ryko CD sorely lacks.  It seems punchier, more immediate and somehow better blended than the Ryko CD version. Also, the bass and the high end so lacking on the Ryko CD (leaving only muddy low midrange and shrill high midrange) are restored on the YepRoc LP - suddenly, the mixes make sense.  The best improvement over previous versions, however, has to be ""Cold Turkey"".  On the Ryko CD, a minute or so into the track, a rather obvious edit can be heard.  At the edit point, the mix seems to change completely.  I assumed it was a case of Hitchcock liking the first part of one mix and the latter part of another (radically different) mix and splicing them together to get a ""composite"" of the two - a fairly common practice in rock recording for years, what're ya gonna do?  I listened to the new YepRoc pressing fully expecting that dreadful edit to be there...but it wasn't.  The mix remains the same throughout - to these ears a much more satisfying listen.  All in all, a cracking good slab o' wax.[Newbies to the world of Soft Boys/Robyn Hitchcock who particularly dig the live tracks that make up the latter half of side 2 ('Cold Turkey', 'Skool Dinner Blues', 'Wading Through a Ventilator') may want to seek out ROUT OF THE CLONES, a full LP/CD from that show.  It contains the CAN OF BEES tracks, and many others, along with some of Hitchcock's inimitable between-song banter, all with a mix different from A CAN OF BEES.  ROUT OF THE CLONES was a scarcity on vinyl for years until it was reissued on a small UK label on both vinyl and CD, the latter featuring more material than the LP.] Look, I'm no audiophile but there is something wrong with Yeprocs vinyl pressing of this album. I have heard two different copies and on both of them the fidelity gets worse and worse as the record progresses. Everybody knows that the first track on an album sounds better than the ones on the inside but I have never heard such a noticeable difference as this.I think this is a case where I would buy the cd instead or seek out an original pressing of the vinyl. Although not the band's best album (and certainly not Robyn's favorite for that matter), Can of Bees is classic Soft Boys. All the elements are here; Kimberly Rew's masterful guitar playing, Morris Windsor's powerful drumming and, of course, Robyn's eccentric songwriting.This import has all the songs found on the Rykodisc release from 5 or 6 years ago but with a much heftier price tag. I'd probably wait for Matador to reissue this (they've done a great job with Underwater Moonlight)as it'll probably come with more extras.Still fresh after all these years, Can of Bees demonstrates Robyn's finding his &quot;voice&quot; as a songwriter. Highly recommended.","Alternative Rock,New Wave & Post-Punk,British Punk,Indie & Lo-Fi,Punk,Pop,New Wave,Post-Punk,Rock,Hardcore & Punk,Jangle Pop",looking cd replace tape gotten years ago love great one awesome rock hard highly venerable band u k discovered soft boys tracing musical legacy syd barrett original lead creative force pink floyd syd barrett one favorite rock musicians time influence band apparent musically spirit like barretts work bees friendly endearing mischievously irreverent underlying screwed quality leppo jooves breakout hit quirky offbeat nature proven somewhat alienating general audiences first seven original absolute treasures culminating ludicrous sandras brain personal favorite quality songwriting drops quite noticeably band simply ran grade looking cd replace tape years love great awesome rock hard highly venerable band u k discovered soft soft boys boys tracing musical legacy syd syd barrett barrett original lead creative creative force force pink pink floyd syd syd barrett barrett favorite rock rock musicians musicians time influence band apparent musically spirit barretts work bees friendly endearing mischievously irreverent underlying screwed quality breakout hit quirky offbeat nature proven somewhat alienating general general audiences audiences original absolute treasures culminating ludicrous brain personal favorite quality drops quite noticeably band simply ran grade
367,726,B0000009W3,"How ignorant and provincial I have been! Until Arthur Lyman's music was highlighted in a spot on NPR's Morning Edition (10/4/03), I had not the slightest clue that anyone on earth other than my family had ever heard of him and his audio-licious TABOO. We received it in the late 50s from a family friend when he unloaded his entire record collection on my parents before shipping overseas. I was smitten with it from the ripe old age of 5!!! The acoustics of the Kaiser Dome and all those exotic animal noises and percussion instruments absolutely transported me. By the time I was 12 or 13, I had worn the grooves down to dust. It was only in the 90s that I dug it out of an ancient cabinet and queued it up again. It brought back miles of memories, but I also came to realize that, while all of the cuts had marvelous mood and execution as well as terrific production values (TUBE GEAR/ANALOG/VINYL RULE!!!), I kept waiting for Lyman to DO SOMETHING with the music, TAKE IT SOMEWHERE. So many themes, not nearly enough development. Still, I am absolutely thrilled to have discovered, albeit late, that this man had a long career, and that millions of other people know who he is. And despite arrangement limitations, TABOO is still an acoustic and instrumental tour de force. BUY THIS ALBUM! Arthur Lyman is undoubtedly one of the best artists of the exotica/cocktail music genre.  If you like this kind of music, then you can't miss with this CD. This music has exotic campiness and I enjoyed this blast from the past.  I like the Matin Denny stuff a little better, but this is still an entertaining album.  A Hollywood/white guy's version of the exotic tropics, but it's fun.  Play it for the luau with the neighbors and bring me a Mai Tai. Okay, so I don't really have the CD.  I would, but I have the original vinyl released before Hawaii was a state.  It's great.  Picked it up for a dollar at the Salvation Army.  I probably will get the CD eventually, but the pops and cracks add some authenticity.  Remastered it would be fine too.

What a Delight to get one of the Favourite Albums of my teen-age years, and it's in a green-tinted jewel case, meaning that it was produced in Canada. This is one of the earliest albums that I can recall from my youth. Arthur Lyman was definetly a fixture in my house, and listening to his music always transports me back to my youth. This album is highly recommended; the sounds are very lovely, and beautiful to the ears. I have actually fallen asleep putting this album on the stereo. If you like to be mentally transported to a distant land, then this album will do the trick. The gentle melodies of Arthur Lyman's music are soothing and will put you in a state of total relaxation.Arthur Lyman started out as a vibraphonist in Martin Denny's band in Hawaii back in the 1950s. [Martin Denny was also great]. When Lyman left the band to form his own, he created a very unique musical style which would result in several albums. [I have them all, thanks to my Mom]. Lyman combined different sounds in his music through the use of a tropical style infused with a jazz sound. The recording of his music was done in the late Henry Kaiser's Shell Bar in Honolulu, which created a unique sound due to the fact that the auditorium was aluminum. This is a highly recommended CD, enjoy the beautiful sound of one of the great instrumentalists of his time. About 40 years ago, I bought this title of a record.Last year I got two CDs of his music.And now I get the disc titled ""Taboo"".Hearing this music, I remember my young days. Same as all other Arthur Lyman reviews--he's the best and this is no different in the category of  Islands Exotic In the dawn of 90s cocktail culture, Arthur Lyman often stands in the shadow of his former bandleader, Martin Denny. Denny is celebrated for his seminal late-50s version of ""Quiet Village"" and his string of influential exotica LPs. Lyman, a charter member of Denny's combo, is often lost, despite having pioneered a unique blend of jazz and exotica on dozens of his own releases.While Scamp Records was busy reissuing Denny's original catalog, Rykodisc took their own plunge into the warm Pacific waters with  reissues of several pivotal Lyman LPsand compilations.As a vibe player and arranger, Lyman has a relaxed West Coast sound, his band playing in a tranquil tropical style. The arrangements feature the essential exotica elements: mainland and island standards, smoothly flowing melodies, human-voiced bird calls, and a globe-trotting collection of percussion instruments.Lyman's solo debut, &quot;Taboo,&quot;  has been remastered from the original 3-track recordings. It's perhaps the clearest statement of his musical mood: cool jazz infused with the rhythms and sounds of his native Hawaii. The differences from Denny's work of the same period are subtle, often hinging on the arrangement, or the slight swing to Lyman's beats. Chances are if you like Denny's seminal early LP's (Exotica, et al.), you'll like Lyman's, as well. Took a chance and ordered this old favorite from the 50's and really surprised to hear it still has great sounds. This was one reel-to-reel tape bought in the 60's because it was so different and exotic. At that time did not realize there was so much jazz in some of the pieces. Sound is really clear and with the extra bonus tracks this is quite a good deal. The music does not feel out of date at all and guess you could say it fits in with the ""world"" music now common in several new bands. Put this one on, pour a glass of wine and just sit in a relaxing chair and listen....it will mellow you out just fine. Along with Martin Denny, Arthur Lyman created a luscious, sensual, and totally FAKE tropical soundscape..... But so what? The music is enchanting, and all you need is a tequila sunrise, (OK so its not a Mai Tai, but hey I'm Chicano!) you hammock, and a glorious Saturday summer afternoon, next to your significant other.... and voila!YOU are ""lost"" in your own tropical eden. Not to bad for the price of a CD..... I just recently started enjoying exotica music. I primarily have been focusing on Martin Denny and Les Baxter, but recently i have been branching out with some new artists. One of them being Arthur Lyman. His music is different then Denny and Baxter. It has a smoother more melodic approach and yet it has good rhythms. Although most of the music has a Polynesian feel to it he does mix in a good amount of jazz stylings. I personally have recommended this CD to a couple of friends who are Vibe players because they can learn from Arthur's technique. He is a fantastic musician and even if the style of music is not in your taste, the performance by the gifted musician is well worth the listen. Prompt delivery and friendly service.. a breath of fresh air in this world.. thank you Okay, I like Mancini-inspired lounge, Bobby Darin, Nat King Cole, etc. I even have an import CD of the Rat Pack(the best one available on CD). However, I'm not a huge exotica freak. I can take or leave Martin Denny and the bunch. Nevertheless, I was looking for a birthday gift for a friend, who's into tiki, and I came across this CD. Now, again, I've looked for Les Baxter before, but the ""Best of..."" compilation(more lounge than exotica). Arthur Lyman, on the other hand, really merges the two styles of lounge and exotica on this album, one of the original exotica albums of the period. My friend really likes it. It's got a couple so-so pieces, too, but for the most part it's pretty fun. This one's definitely for the lounge lover who secretly likes mai-tais. If exotica isn't your thing, check it out. You may be surprised on this one. My friend has the soundtrack to the film ""2046"" and I knew he'd go for this. I previously had a reel to reel tape of this recording.I just purchased and received this Taboo CD by Author Lyman from Amazon.com and it is just as great as I remembered, and I really enjoy it.I had previously purchased the CD called Quiet Village by Martin Denny from Amazon.com.Although it is similar, it is not nearly as enjoyable.Richard Both Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny led similar sounding groups that specialised in what was then called ""Exotica"". It sounds pretty corny today but it's good fun and well done. Beneath all the wild bird and animal calls there are very good musicians who play some pretty good music. The original labels, Hi-Fi for Lyman and Liberty for Denny must have done well out of these guys. This is a great album that brought back a lot of good memories of Hawaii. I remember this music from the 60's, but I'd forgotten how relaxing and romantic it is.  Put on the CD, close your eyes and be transported to a tropical island.","Pop,Easy Listening",ignorant provincial arthur lymans highlighted spot nprs morning edition slightest clue anyone earth family ever heard audio licious taboo received late family friend unloaded entire record collection parents shipping overseas smitten ripe old age acoustics kaiser dome exotic animal noises percussion instruments absolutely transported time worn grooves dust dug ancient cabinet queued brought back miles memories also came realize cuts marvelous mood execution well terrific production values tube gear analog vinyl rule kept waiting lyman something take somewhere many themes nearly enough development still ab ignorant provincial arthur lymans highlighted spot nprs morning edition edition clue earth family heard audio taboo received late family family friend friend unloaded entire record record collection collection parents shipping overseas smitten ripe old old age age acoustics dome exotic exotic animal animal animal noises noises percussion percussion instruments instruments absolutely transported time worn grooves dust dug ancient cabinet queued brought brought back miles memories came realize cuts marvelous mood execution terrific production production values values tube gear analog vinyl rule kept waiting themes nearly development
368,727,B0000009W4,"This is a BAD recording. It's titled &#34;The Sounds of Arthur Lyman&#34; but sound nothing like it. The bass is overemphasized to the extent that I must turn down the volume on the sub to make it bearable. The tempo of the tracks are lazy and in an attempt to salvage the effort, four bonus tracks from another recording are added. A total waste. If you're new to the long-gone world of Exotica music, this is NOT a beginners album.  A great exotica album to start with would be Robert Drasnin's ""Voodoo"" or Vol. 1 from Capitol Records ""Ultra Lounge"" series.  Having said that, this is a nice, calm entry in the Arthur Lyman library.  Lyman's style of exotica was much softer than that of Martin Denny and Les Baxter, highlighting his soothing vibraphone over birdcalls and mild percussion.  Sometimes you hear someone talk about something that ""really speaks"" to them.  This is an album that will not speak to you, it will whisper.  Lyman is one of the masters of exotica, and this is supreme Hawaiian lounge music, performed as quietly as possible.At first, when you put this album on and lay down to relax, you will suspect something is wrong with your stereo speakers.  The sounds here are so soft, you'll barely hear it, and you'll get up to raise the volume.  You'll notice the music moving along at a moderate pace.  Lyman's vibraphone sounds attractive but the melody of each tune never takes hold because all you want to do is fall for the mood of the music rather than the song itself.  Babies and grandparents alike could relax to this record or anybody else who needs help while trying to take a nap.  ""Hawaiian Sunset"" isn't as cartoonish as so many other exotica records, this is intended to put you to sleep while planting dreams for you of a vacation on the isle of Maui.  The music on this album is barely noticeable, and I think Arthur Lyman intended it that way. Take a mini vacation and let your mind wander to these sounds of Arthur Lyman and his band.  Sure to please and relax. I really enjoy listening to this music. He, along with Martin Denny, were among the first groups to use sounds from nature ( the surf, thunderstorms, etc,) and I have found the music very soothing and peaceful. Any Cd of his is terrific. you can find a clip of his performances on U Tube fromt he 60's in O'ahu.","Hawaii,Pacific Islands,World Music,Pop,Easy Listening",bad recording titled sounds arthur lyman sound nothing like bass overemphasized extent must turn volume sub make bearable tempo lazy attempt salvage effort four bonus another recording added total waste youre new long gone world exotica beginners great exotica start would robert drasnins voodoo vol capitol records ultra lounge series said nice calm entry arthur lyman library lymans style exotica much softer martin denny les baxter highlighting soothing vibraphone birdcalls mild percussion sometimes hear someone talk something really speaks speak whisper lyman one masters exotica supreme hawaiian lounge performed quietly possib bad recording titled sounds sound bass overemphasized extent turn volume sub bearable tempo lazy attempt salvage effort bonus recording added total waste youre new long world exotica beginners great start voodoo vol capitol capitol records records ultra ultra lounge lounge series said nice calm entry arthur arthur lyman library style exotica martin martin denny denny highlighting soothing vibraphone birdcalls mild percussion hear talk really speaks speak whisper masters exotica hawaiian lounge performed quietly
369,728,B0000009XB,"I never heard of this guy, but after listening to this CD for a day, I ordered all of his others.  Good stuff for sure. Sweet Blues !Fenton lays down some Good stuff, a blues man indeed !Hopefully the kids will find this and another Blues revival will start !!! Fenton left us late last year - he will be sorely missed. Brilliant in his  own right, masterful in both recordings and live venues (Fenton rarely  performed live). This album is simply phenomenal. Want to feel the blues?  Down to the deepest depths of your soul? Get this CD! A must have for any  appreciator of music - blues or otherwise. I used to listen to Somebody Loan me a Dime when I was a teenager and then lost the cd. Now in my 30s, rediscovering this on Spotify brings back my initial impression. He's got some jazz phrasing that sets him apart from most of the typical Chicago blues sound. Not to mention very nice smooth vocals. I agree with the person that said he has more in common with T-bone Walker than most blues guitarists. It's refreshing to hear clean, thick, big hollowbody jazzy blues. Great inspiration for a guitarist such as myself. I believe this remains as his classic album. BEYOND AWESOME!!!  I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN HE EVEN EXISTED IF A FRIEND HADN'T TOLD ME HE WOULD LIKE TO FIND IT.  UNBELEIVABLE IF YOU LIKE THE BLUES, AND I LOVE THE BLUES!!!!!!!!! Although I had heard of Fenton Robinson, I was not familiar with his music. Somebody Loan Me a Dime was indeed a great ""find."" People, listen, this is the real deal. This is classic Chicago blues. The vocals are amazing, the guitar playing is laid back and beautiful and the backing band is first rate. This is what blues should be and what it isn't, anymore. There is a great mix of minor key tunes, shuffles and swing and Fenton pullls off these different styles with class. He somehow perfected a sweet-gruffness to his singing - it is hard to describe, but it is very effective. He can, vocally, hold a note/line a long time and it sounds great. His guitar playing is a model of what should be done by a professional musician. It is understated, jazzy and very bluesy. There is no distortion, reverb or overdrive - just straight ahead playing. I've read a lot about how Buddy Guy can't get on mainstream radio, and that is very true. Guy's solution is to play a lot of rock and roll and with a lot of noise. Listen, Guy is entitled. But blues music, of any kind, will never get much mainstream radio support. It makes moresense to stick to what is true to the art form. If there are any kids reading this, who are interested in playing electric blues, Buy this CD. Not to copy it, per se, but to see how it is done. All the Robillard's amd Earl's will never match this for originality and powerful vocals. Fenton Robinson was a bluesman with country grit and city sophistication at the same time. This is the album on which it all came together.As I write this review, all the Customer Reviews are five star. I completely agree. This CD arrived and I was not sure what to expect, but it fulfilled my best hopes at the true sound of rhythm and blues. When I think of Alligator Records, I typically associate that label with fairly modern, often times &#34;slick&#34; recordings featuring modern production approaches to modern blues artists. Much of the time, their approach to production is well suited to the artists they record.  In this case, the recording from the early seventies is a no frills, roll tape and let's just get this band recorded approach. The end result is pure Chicago blues.  The combination of Fenton's vocal approach, his playing, the rhythm section (especially the sound of the bass guitar) and horns all sound like they were straight out of a Saturday night gig at Kingston Mines on Lincoln Avenue. Once I purchased this recording, I listened to Fenton's other listed recordings on Amazon - comparatively speaking, none has the charm and authenticity of Somebody Loan Me a Dime. This record is a gem -a little known blues classic. It's highly representative of a period in Chicago music that unfortunately has long passed. Fenton Robinson was one of the most promising blues artists of the 70's.  With a beautiful voice and guitar style he had it all to hit it big.  But despite releasing several very fine albums his career never took off, mainly because his style did not appeal to the mass blues fan base who wanted it all to sound like SRV or Johnny Winter.  Though he was based in Chicago, his style was jazzier and owed more to T-Bone Walker than Muddy Waters, making even more distinct.  After releasing a pair of disappointing albums for 77 Records he went to Alligator Records to record this, his finest album and one of the best blues albums of the 70's.  He co-produced with Bruce Igauler and they got the perfect sound and feel for what was needed for a Fenton Robinson.  The backing band is terrific, which includes Mighty Joe Young, who contributes very fine and unobtrusive rhythm guitar.  The song's are varied, including several terrific slow blues (""Somebody Loan Me A Dime"", ""Directly From My Heart To You"") to more up-tempo numbers (""The Getaway"", ""You Don't Know What Love Is"").  There are a few well chosen covers as well, including his friend Larry Davis's ""Texas Flood"" and the classic ""Going To Chicago"".  Throughout Fenton's smooth guitar playing and rich vocals are out front, definitely making him the star of the album.This is an essential blues album, though it has not garnered the attention it deserves despite being as good as it is.  Fenton died in 1997, and so this album is the best way to remember this truly great and under-recognized blues master. While Chicago has an impeccable list of blues giants, not many of those  lists include Mississippi born, Fenton Robinson.  On &quot;Somebody Loan Me  a Dime&quot; Fenton blends incredibly tasteful guitar work, soulful vocals  and a silky smooth funk groove, into a perfect blues experience.  A  mandatory addition to any blues catalog. No need rehashing Fenton Robinson's life story nor his credits. Suffice to say, this is one of the best blues albums you will find. Robinson's rich, heartfelt vocals give every song a haunting quality and you wonder how this man manages not to be mentioned among the likes of B.B. King, Bobby Bland, John Lee Hooker, et al. I used to listen as my dad played this album, and though I was no fan of the blues then, it was this album that got me hooked. This also shows how the album has stood the test of time.All the songs are special, but the standouts for me are ""Texas Flood,"" ""I Gotta Wake Up,"" and ""Directly From My Heart To You.""Alligator records may be defunct, but this reissue shows one of the best examples of the quality of music that label produced.","Chicago Blues,Regional Blues,Pop,Texas Blues,Electric Blues,Modern Blues,Blues",never heard guy listening cd day ordered others good stuff sure sweet blues fenton lays good stuff blues man indeed hopefully kids find another blues revival start fenton left us late last year sorely missed brilliant right masterful recordings live venues fenton rarely performed live simply phenomenal want feel blues deepest depths soul get cd must appreciator blues otherwise used listen somebody loan dime teenager lost cd rediscovering spotify brings back initial impression hes got jazz phrasing sets apart typical chicago blues sound mention nice smooth vocals agree person said common bone walker blues guitarists refreshing hear clean th heard guy listening cd day ordered good stuff sure sweet blues lays good stuff blues blues man man hopefully kids find blues blues revival revival start left late last year year sorely missed brilliant right masterful recordings live venues rarely performed live simply phenomenal want feel blues depths soul cd blues used listen somebody loan dime teenager lost cd rediscovering spotify brings brings back initial impression got jazz phrasing sets sets apart apart typical chicago chicago blues blues sound mention nice smooth vocals agree person said common bone blues blues guitarists guitarists refreshing hear clean

372,732,B0000009Z3,"Bought this Lazy Lester album down in New Orleans at the Louisiana Music Factory.  I like it because it is loose, sloppy and has an easy-going feel.  Good job by Lazy Lester.

He cracks me up on alot of the songs on this CD just because I can hear the humor and irony in his voice. His is a natural voice for all kinds of music and thats what's here on this CD. You get Bo Diddley's ""I'm A Man"", Boyd's classic ""Five Long Years"", you get Classic Blues, Cajun, some country, and  alittle Rockabilly, something like I imagine would be on the bill at a big shrimp and crawdad feast along some country road down in Louisiana, or maybe in a little dive juke joint late some Saturday night on some dark swamp road.Put another log on the fire, yell for another cold beer and enjoy Lesters songs,"" Take Me In Your Arms"",and the"" Alligator Shuffle"", and ""Bye Bye Baby"", some goodies he wrote.Kenny Neal does a class A job on guitar too....they all sound [darn] good to me too.Lester's voice sounds perfect on almost all of the songs here due to his practising by performing professionally since the 50's.The liner notes give info on Lester's personality also, here's a quote:""The fans who are meeting Lester for the first time sem to be equally astonished by his terrific harp playing and his wacky sense of humor. In New England, he's been called ""a national treasure"", in New York, ""The High Sherrif of Louisiana"", in Atlanta, ""A Nut"", and in Austin the newspapers wrote ""he aint lazy, he's crazy.""You'll hear some people saying, ""Chuck Berry, Forever and ever!"". I gotta add my cry of ""Long live King Lester, as mellow as they come.""please enjoy and thank you. I have seen him a couple of times in person, and he is the best!

373,734,B0000009ZY,"This is one of the best albums by Otis. Usually the problem is that he refers to emotions too directly by singing and playing phrases that have an analogy that is too close to actual screams of pain or dispair. Here he recognizes the medium of music and creates some great openness in his music through singing in a more abstract and relaxed way, letting timing and the solid blues scheme do the work. The Jimmy Reed tunes are more than entertainment (no pushing the button entertainment as is mentioned in a review here). These more straight blues songs, which in their abstract form leave no place for direct emotions, suit him very well. The band is very good as it does not stress the backbeat too much which gives the solo's and singing the change to take off and stay in the air without bringing them back to the ground at each beat.bela teeken While any Otis Rush effort will always include fine guitar work and great singing, Lost in the Blues is one of his least interesting albums.  First time listeners would be better off going directly to the Cobra material  which includes some of the finest blues ever recorded or either of his two  most recent recordings.  Lost in the Blues is a downer for Rush fans on all  scores. Alligator Records' lack of respect for Otis in the release ought to  motivate blues fans to turn elsewhere. As ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"", if I could summarize the categories of blues aficionado's, I would put them into 3 main groups. 1) Acoustic (Not for Shaq.) 2) mellow (Shaq likes some.) 3) string bending, thundering, lightning, earthquaking, TIDAL WAVE, soul shaking, guttural, blues! (My favorite type!) This CD by Otis, is definitely ""mellow"". I rate it 3 stars, but if ""mellow"" blues is your style, it would probably be a 4. This CD is reminiscent to me, of BB's ""Blues on the Bayou"". (See previous Shaq review.) SUMMARY: If you want to mellow out, this CD is for you. If you want to shake yourself up, this is not for you. Hoo! Haa! This is a competent release and while Otis may not be happy with it his guitar sounds sweet and his voice sounds as warm as ever.  The problem is that this just isn't the best material Otis ever touched and while varying drastically in tone and style &quot;Cold Day in Hell&quot;, &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, or a compilation of his Cobra sides is where to find out what Otis Rush is all about.  Look here when you've got those essential discs as well as the currently out of print &quot;Anyplace I'm Going&quot; and the still available &quot;Ain't Enough Comin' In&quot;.  But just because it's on Alligator don't assume this release is the one with the most cred.  It's one of the ones with the least.  It's near the bottom of his studio work.  It's not bad.  I've heard LOTS of blues worse than this.  However, for a legend like Rush there are many places to look first.  And if you're a completist you'll buy this no matter what I say, won't you?","Electric Blues,Blues,Regional Blues,Pop,Chicago Blues",one best otis usually problem refers emotions directly singing playing phrases analogy close actual screams pain dispair recognizes medium creates great openness singing abstract relaxed way letting timing solid blues scheme work jimmy reed tunes entertainment pushing button entertainment mentioned review straight blues abstract form leave place direct emotions suit well band good stress backbeat much gives solos singing change take stay air without bringing back ground beat bela teeken otis rush effort always include fine guitar work great singing lost blues one least interesting first time listeners one best usually problem refers emotions directly singing playing phrases analogy close actual screams pain dispair recognizes medium creates great openness singing abstract relaxed way letting timing solid blues scheme work jimmy jimmy reed tunes entertainment pushing button entertainment mentioned review straight blues abstract form leave place direct emotions suit band good stress backbeat solos singing change stay air bringing bringing back ground beat otis rush rush effort include fine guitar work great singing lost blues interesting time listeners
374,735,B000000A04,"I listened to this CD on broadcast.com and came straight away to amazon.com to buy it.  This is a must for anyone who claims to love the blues.  Buddy's guitar and Junior's harmonica tell it like it is.  This  will rank with my John Lee Hooker CDs among the best in my collection. This album is a welcome return to acoustic blues. The guitar playing is crisp, accurate and soulful and the singing is first rate. An essential purchase for blues lovers. Readers of this space may be aware that over the past year or so I have gone to great lengths to highlight some of the blues greats that I was doggedly devoted to as a kid (and still am) and who helped form in me, and others from my generation, the Generation of '68 as well, an important musical component as we fought our political battles for a more just society. The names of Lead Belly, Josh White, Son House, Muddy Waters and the like easily come to mind.And then in a whisper in the back of the brain comes- don't forget Buddy Guy. Well, of course. The Chicago blues branch of the blues tree would not be complete without recognizing what every serious blues artist of the time recognized- here was a master. This CD only goes to prove the point. Electric guitar, acoustic guitar, solo, with Junior Wells, as a backup to others and so on Guy did it all. Even with all-star help here this is strictly Buddy's gig. That's why there was that little whisper.So what is good here? Well, how about the super-blues classic ""Rollin' and Tumblin'"", the wild ""High Heel Sneakers"" and the sensuous ""Sally Mae"". Listen and see if you agree. Very nice blues, kind of smooth.  The medley and Cut you loose are my faves.  Them Rollin and tumblin.  I also like their TNT CD. Buddy Guy and Junior Wells do not quite replicate the magic of Hoodoo Man Blues, but Wow, they come as close as could be expected nearly 20 years after the release of that marvelous and inimitable 1965 album.  What we are treated to on this album are the songs which are in the annals of blues history as the tried and true blues greats.  From ""Boogie Chillin'"" to ""My Home is in the Delta"", we get an experience of the blues as (in my opinion) they are meant to be, pure and acoustic.  And listen closely to the lyrics of ""My Home is in the Delta"".....the lyrics are vastly different from those of the same song Muddy Waters sang decades ago.  These two take blues classics and reshape them to fit their own style, instead of simply making a retread of a famous song.One of the ""must have"" albums in the modern blues genre. Oh Buddy Guy and Junior Wells hanging out in Paris, making incredible music.... Oh I wanted to love this vinyl album, so much, so so much. I think those that have said the CD is better, are probably right. The pressing is good and flat and well centered, but there are a number of strange strained areas on the disc that aren't dirt, they are pressing flaws.The music is to die for. In 1981 Junior and Buddy were touring Europe. They stopped by a studio in Paris where Buddy played acoustic guitar and Junior played harmonica. Those two did an unplugged blues album. Buddy is incredible on the electric guitar; nobody can play quite like he does. After all, Stevie Ray, Jimi, and Eric were heavily influenced by Buddy. Nobody has a stage presence quite like him. He drives that electric guitar like nobody else. To hear him caress an acoustic guitar the way he does on this album is incredible, and so unexpected.The album is almost and hour long, some incredible feat to put that much music on a single LP. They sing a few songs they each wrote, some John Lee, and others. This album is almost like sitting in a dead silent perfect live club listening to them. The magic of creating blues was captured on this album.Sorry to say that the vinyl might not be really worth buying. It is so too darn bad, the music is incredible. This album just begs to be mastered and pressed properly. I'll still listen to this LP; you know blues isn't ever perfect. I could sit and listen to these two all day. It would be great if more blues albums were made this way. The pure sound of a 12 string guitar and a unamplified harmonica. I think the great vocals of Junior Wells on &quot;Big Boat&quot; would be worth the price of this album alone - but it is just one of the many treats on this album. This album is full of standard blues classics, but the sound is so fresh it is like you are hearing them for the first time.A treat for anyone, no matter what their favorite style of the blues is. This CD is at least as good as any CDs by the Sonny Terry &amp; Brownie McGhee duo, and its sound quality is better. The singing, acoustic guitar playing, and 'the blues harp' are all crystally pure and innocent. Gee, I love this kind of blues! Absolutely the best acoustic blues album (MP3) I own. If you like the blues -- buy it! This CD is simply outstanding.  Originally released in 1981, it features blues greats Buddy Guy and Junior Wells unplugged.  Two men, one day in Paris, one acoustic guitar and one harmonica with each  sharing the vocal  duties.  While the material is not new it is performed with such  individuality and conviction that other interpretations of this same  material pales in comparison.  There are 15 songs arranged into an hours  worth of deep south acoustic blues.  This has got to be one of Alligators  finest releases and is a must have for any fan of these two giants, fans of  acoustic blues and fans of the blues period. I loved this CD from the very first notes played by Buddy on the first track 'Give me my coat and Shoes'.They took turns in singing and Wells' harmonica and Guy's guitar sound fantastic throughout this album.A couple of John Lee Hooker songs in the shape of 'I'm in the mood' and 'Boogie Chillen' but for me the last track medley of 'Baby what do you want me to do/That's allright' is just world class! Buddy started off by singing like Jimmy Reed but soon 'found' his own voice again. Fantastic music from two guys who enjoy being together and who simply love their music.  And it shows here! Okay, an acoustic guitar and a harmonica, how good can it be? Geez, everything must sound the same!Eh? Well, it can be very good indeed, actually. And it is.1991's &quot;Alone & Acoustic&quot; is one of the very best of the numerous albums that Chicago blues greats Buddy Guy and Junior Wells recorded together, an intimate, expressive session, and a showcase for Guy's abilities on the acoustic twelve-string as well as for Amos &quot;Junior&quot; Wells' tasteful harp playing.Sharing lead vocals, the relaxed mood seems to suggest that the two old friends are just sitting down for an hour of easy jamming, but the performances are never sloppy, always tight and done with honesty and conviction.Buddy Guy and Junior Wells play their own compositions (Guy's &quot;Give Me My Coat And Shoes&quot; and Wells' &quot;Big Boat&quot; are among the highlights), as well as covering artists like Jimmy Rogers (a great &quot;That's All Right&quot;), Sonny Terry (an equally fine &quot;Diggin' My Potatoes&quot;), and John Lee Hooker. There are no fewer than three John Lee Hooker-numbers here, actually, and rather than substituting his own name in Hooker's mini-epos &quot;Boogie Chillen&quot;, George &quot;Buddy&quot; Guy lets the narrator refer to himself as &quot;Johnny&quot;!Okay, so the setting may have been an Alligator Records studio, but this is still acoustic street-corner blues at its best, and one of the warmest, most enjoyable blues records I've ever listened to. This is two old blues pro's and running mates doing it up!Yes its laid back, improvised fun...but thats what Buddy and Junior were all about.  I love it and I think anybody who is a fan of these two giants will too. I got this CD back in the 90s.  Since then, I've been looking for anything that comes close to it.  If there is acoustic blues anywhere that approaches this album, I can't find it.  I don't believe it is there, even in other recordings by these two.For me, this album defines blues.  Not the Chicago blues you expect from Buddy Guy, but the rawest Delta blues you'll ever hear.This is one I wouldn't want to be without. Everytime I listen to this wonderful performance, I have an urge to offer Junior &amp; Buddy some coffee. The sound of this CD makes you feel like this pair is sitting next to you, playing just for you. And if one could have them play just for him, wouldn't he offer them, at least, some coffee?The CD is quiet, calm, natural and with the deep voices of the artists makes a great companion for the winter season.This CD contains a collection of mostly classics tracks, some vocals by Junior and some be Buddy (But no duets but the last track). You'll love this one whether you are a blues fan or not. Everytime I listen to this wonderful performance, I have an urge to offer Junior &amp; Buddy some coffee.

THAT TOGETHER WITH THE GUITAR THE MIXING OF BOTH &quot;INSTRUMENTS&quot; IS AMAZING!!RECORD TO DIE4. 10 years I've had this cd, and it has been a constant favorite.  I also love the heavily instrumented and ""loud"" albums of buddy guy and junior wells, but this album is much different.  It covers a completely different mood, occasion for listening.the vocals are amazing, the guitar is feel good.  I can't get enough of this sound, so the fact that some of the songs sound like the one before is not a bad thing here. This collection of two great bluesmen emphasizes a closer connection to roots blues than many latter-day releases. You can't go wrong if you want to connect the folk blues with modern blues. Full of class and style, and one that you'll return to many times... This is a fantastic album and the music is just a MUST HAVE.  I bought vinyl (the sound quality is great), but the pressing quality is just dismal.  I thought I had a bad pressing and returned it (Amazon.com is just amazing).  I had a new copy within 2 days and that is just as bad.  I've even cleaned both copies on my VPI 16.5 record cleaning machine to no avail.  Very subtle improvement, but the pressing is plain noisy, no fill areas and a pathetic way to present such a good album. I was so excited to hear it all analog and it just disappointed me.  I am in two minds about returning my second vinyl copy as well and stick with the CD.Should have used RTI for the pressing and should have had Kevin Gray master it...If you're going to go through the trouble of putting a release on vinyl, do it properly or don't do it at all. Simple as that. Got to agree with the sentiment of the other reviews here. This is one brilliant acoustic blues album. Pity that Buddy Guy hasn't devoted more of his immense talents to the acoustic format. His singing is fantastic, playing brilliant, as is Junior Wells. Thoroughly recommend this CD for anyone, blues fans or not. This product meets expectations any fan of the blues could ask for, content and cliarity are very good. If you are looking for a warm feeling old style blues ( circa 1940's to early 50's) this will satisfy anyone who enjoys the blues of older times and the twelve string rifs are impressive to say the least. The magical synergy of Junior Wells and Buddy Guy was apparent in  ""Hoodoo Man Blues"", recorded before Buddy Guy was well known.  Junior Wells' subsequent solo works, while workmanlike, have never achieved the same pinnacle (e.g., Come On Into This House).  With this joint effort, that synergy is back.It is very interesting to see (hear) the pair together 30 years after that first work together.  The undefinable synergy is still there -  Is it the way Buddy sets up a background for Junior's vocals or harmonica?  Or is it the way that Junior defers to Buddys guitar?  However, with age, the two interact more sensitively and with a polish - No, a burnished patina - that makes this work a mellower version of their earlier work together.  Both performers are secure in their careers and accomplishments and this results in a very special and mature interaction between them.From the folk blues of Big Boat to the John Lee Hooker homage in Boogie Chillen, the pairing in ""Alone and Acoustic"" is seamless - You can almost see one person playing the guitar and harmonica while singing.Caution: As the title suggests, this is not the Buddy Guy that Jimi Hendrix studied. For those of us who grew up with the Eric Clapton of John Mayall (also Cream, Blind Faith)  Canned Heat, and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac as our introduction to the blues (along with Hendrix's 'Red House') in the late 60's, this could be a disappointment.  But to me the CD is not.  It is a great pleasure, with the lack of other instruments a sort of relief.  No, for those of us of that era, this is more like the 'Hot Tuna' record (remember records?) after lots of electric music from Jefferson Airplane, Led Zepplin, Cream, Iron Butterfly, etc...  clean and unpretentious.And in 'Big Boat' we hear something like one of my favorites from Hoodoo Man, Buddy's sharp ""Ow!"" during Junior's first harmonica solo in 'Early in the Morning'. And Buddy  sings on this one, too!  (Hoodoo Man is one of the classic blues albums - Do yourself a favor and get it if you don't have it!)A wonderful CD to just listen to and enjoy. what else can be said? with guy/wells you got a great cd of  acoustic/harmonica blues recorded from france. I've said it before and I'll say it again (over and over) I'm sure, the best way to hear a blues artist is live...and this is one of the best moments ever caught on tape.  Solo, both Buddy Guy and the late Junior  Wells, are fabulous, but there was a magic when they played together.  This  1981 set captures the early days of blues as played on backporches all  through the south.  I heard one cut on a radio show and went out to find  the disc and it's been one of the prized recordings in my collection.  YOU  MUST OWN THIS! This is a good representation of traditional acoustic, country blues.  The playing is great.  The songs are a little on the average side. All I can say is that I have over 200 titles in my collection and this wonderful CD has been my favorite for years.... Two of the Blues greats, both individually and as a duo, play classic early blues tunes. Very basic. Also very boring. No virtuoso solos, no hot guitar licks, no great blues harp riffs. No song is memorable, nor is any of the playing. Nothing I want to hear a second time. In fact, the songs are so forgettable that I forgot that I'd already purchased the album and downloaded it a second time. In listening to the songs and rating them I finally stumbled to the fact that I already had the album. Searching my listings I also discovered that I'd previously rated the songs exactly the same.I've been listening to folk and blues since the early '60s and I prefer acoustic to electric, this is a good album for someone wanting to learn about the blues or who wants to learn to play blues guitar or harmonica but it is certainly not their best work in terms of great musicianship. I've always heard Buddy in electric mode and I was totally shocked at how he sounded and played unplugged. I must admit that I cheated and listened to this on the internet but I had to buy it after hearing it. Yes, we all thought it would be good but it is best to chalk this one off as a loss. If you were unfortunate enough to be someone who actually paid for the album, the going rate on ebay is around 9 Buddy Guy is a killer electric guitarist, but this album shows off how truly great of a guitarist he is.  Just acoustic guitar and harmonica with Buddy signing, worth more money then they are charging. Very enjoyable set with Buddy Guy and Junior Wells.  Performance is very good and recording quality is fine.  Purchased on vinyl.  Poorest quality pressing I have seen in some time.  Very audible distortion bursts occur on several songs that can only be attributed to the poor quality of the pressing. Recommend that those purchasing this work do so on CD rather than on vinyl. this is a lesson from the masters of blues on how to miix it up.One of my favorites. Get it. My past experiences with Buddy Guy's music has been with his fender plugged in and turned up.A true blues icon imitated by every guitar player in the last decade so you could imagine my suprise to see this acoustic set  with Junior Wells. Let me tell you one thing...I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!! He is a  master of the guitar ..plugged in or not.This albulm is the real deal born  from the juke-joints of yesterday.Every note he plays takes you furthur  back to the days of smoke filled gin joints where hard working folk escaped  the oppression of their days. If you only buy one CD this year make it this  one. It is the best blues I ever heard. Buddy and Junior keepin it strong  and real.Robert Johnson would be proud to hear his blues come full circle  .THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ...and I mean raw in a good way. This CD is old school blues. The combination of two giants in the blues world is wonderful. The combination of a lone guitar and harmonica is blues at its best. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is because I would have replaced a few of the songs on the album with alternates that I felt didn't work quite as well as others. I hate to think what might have been left on the proverbial ""cutting room floor"". This is simply a great bit of acoustic blues. I highly recommend it for any listening audience. Recording since the early 1950's, Buddy Guy and Junior Wells represent the cream of rhythm and blues ... and Alone & Acoustic may just be one of the first of what's become known as ""Unplugged"" performances.  While the material is not new, the presentation is, these two gunslingers faced off in Paris back around 1981, during a European tour, Buddy Guy with his smokin' Chicago guitar, and Junior Wells rippin' up the place with his legendary harmonica, both sharing lead vocals, and both harmonizing with each other and their instruments.  All of the fifteen tracks found here are pure southern roots blues, delivered with conviction, in the manner necessary for pure blues to be heard ... acoustically.What's been laid down here is nothing short of historical magic, where these two gentlemen at the pinnacle of their game, managed to circle back and not only rediscover each other again after thirty years, but to rediscover the essence of the most important music in the world, music that is hands down responsible for all that rock n' roll ever was.  As laid back as these numbers sound, there's a tension in the air that allows Buddy and Junior to interact with each other on a sensitive level, one that flows across the floor, and snakes up your legs, like the devil himself reaching out to corrupt your very soul.It's thrilling to hear renditions of songs such as ""Rollin' & Tumblin',"" ""Sweet Black Girl,"" and ""High Heeled Sneakers,"" songs we've come to treasure as back-bending electric blues staples, sounding all the more demanding, lighter than ear, and all the more essential here.  There are few albums which I would consider masterpieces, Blonde On Blonde, by Mr. Dylan is one, Revolver, by the Beatles is another, not to mention The Rolling Stones' Beggar's Banquet"" ... all of which, owe everything that's found right here.Dig it ...Review by Jenell Kesler It's geat live, impromptu blues, good quality, good jams, great harmonica, a must have for anyone who loves Junior and Buddy. This album is so magnificent and the essence of the blues at it's most primal and magic level. You must hear this unamplified or gussied up studio tricks to really find the heart of the blues. Buddy Guy and Junior Wells have long been icons on the Chicago Blues scene.  With this album they take their roots in Delta Blues and portray them in an acoustical venue.  Guy's guitar mastery is shown in this album using both a 12 string as well as 6 string guitar.  The sound of Junior Wells' harmonica provides an accompaniment that should be considered a benchmark for any true blues lover.If this were merely an instrumental recording, it would be well worth it, but it comes with the vocals of both Buddy Guy and Junior Wells which give one the feel of the true soul stirring blues that has made this style of music popular for so long.  This is a recording that is to be listened to and cherished over a long period of time.","Chicago Blues,Pop,Electric Blues,R&B,Regional Blues,Acoustic Blues,Contemporary Blues,Blues",listened cd broadcast com came straight away amazon com buy must anyone claims love blues buddys guitar juniors harmonica tell like rank john lee hooker cds among best collection welcome return acoustic blues guitar playing crisp accurate soulful singing first rate essential purchase blues lovers readers space may aware past year gone great lengths highlight blues greats doggedly devoted kid still helped form others generation generation well important musical component fought political battles society names lead belly josh white son house muddy waters like easily come mind whisper back brain comes dont forget buddy guy well course chicago blues branch listened cd broadcast com came straight straight away away amazon com com buy claims love blues buddys guitar juniors tell rank john john lee hooker lee lee hooker cds best collection welcome return acoustic acoustic blues blues blues guitar blues guitar playing guitar playing crisp accurate soulful singing first rate rate essential purchase blues blues lovers lovers readers space aware past year great lengths highlight blues greats doggedly devoted kid helped form generation generation important musical component fought political battles society names lead lead belly belly josh white white son son house house muddy muddy waters waters easily come mind whisper brain comes forget buddy buddy guy guy course chicago chicago blues blues branch
375,736,B000000A0H,"Billy Boy Arnold has never received the attention he deserves.

376,737,B000000A10,"Just what I expected.  Luther's intensity still makes me marvel. One of the ultimate albums to own in your blues collection.  Luther pours  his soul into the songs and drags you in with him.  A must for anyone who  loves music. as always, Luther delivers his excellent guitar and great vocals on this cd just like all the others.  You can't go wrong on anything Luther or Bernard Allison if you are a true blues lover, or just love great guitar playing. Luther Allison's Blue Streak is simply one of the best blues albums around.  There is not a disappointing track on the entire CD.  From the infectious wood-block beat of &quot;What have I Done Wrong&quot; to the  heart-wrenching &quot;Cherry Red Wine&quot;, Allison poured his heart and  soul into every cut. The combination of Allison's powerful vocals and  virtuoso guitar playing blend perfectly; neither takes the back seat to the  other.  If you have never heard Luther Allison, give this CD a listen.  Then, like me, you'll be a fan and want to have all of his CD's.  Rest in  peace, Luther. Watch out!  &quot;Restless&quot; gathered much more acclaim, but this CD is just as good if not better!  There's a lot of heart and soul, as well as electric blues on this one.  It's too bad Luther passed away just as he was  really hitting his stride. This is a great album.  He didn't ever make back blues music.  He plays with such passion.  I dont think it gets much better than this.Move from the hood is probably my favorite on this album When this cd came out in 1995 it was one of the top albums on Guitar World's magazine year end list and for good reason! Excellent production, deep stirring vocals, Icy guitar playing and an excellent band added to a great cd! A favorite on The Crazy Coyote Blues Power Show 1490 KOTY AM (1490koty.com) Yakima Nation Radio in south central Washington state. Another strong Chicago blues album from Allison and band.  This is a great album that features some killer guitar and Allison's trademark vocals.  I believe Allison won a W.C. Handy award for song of the year with ""Cherry Red Wine"" from this album, and it is a great track.  I have since heard it recorded by several other artists including Johnny Lang, but none of them hold up to the original.  Allsion also branches into some slide and steel guitar on this album which adds some nice variety.  Other standout tracks include ""All The Kings Horses"", ""Walking Papers"", ""What's Going On In My Home"", ""Big City"", and ""Move From The Hood"".  As on previous albums Allison maintains a kind of 70's funk vibe to some of his stuff, which works quite well.

380,750,B000000B4C,"The Seeds, enough said. This CD is a welcome treat to those of us who have owned the official releases and needed more. This CD is a companion piece to an earlierSeeds CD, which featured their first two albums.  This one features the ""best"" songs that were not on their first two albums, other than ""Pushin' Too Hard"", which was.  My personal favorite song is the haunting ""The Wind Blows Your Hair"".  Some other good ones include ""Satisfy You"", ""Flower Lady and Her Assistant"", ""A Thousand Shadows"", ""Nobody Spoil My Fun"" and ""900 Million People Daily"" (available here for the first time in the uncut ten minute version).  Some of the other songs are rather mediocre, though.  The Seeds actually recorded a blues album, which was a mistake, as they didn't really have an affinity for that type of material (thankfully only one song from that album is included here).  Not every song is a winner, but there aren't any complete failures here, either.  Fans of the '60s garage band or psychedelic scenes should enjoy it. I really like this particular album by 'The Seeds'. I think all the selection of songs are really good examples of their material, some of the songs are more rare than others. If your into 'The Seeds' or just want to check them out, to see what their sound is like, I highly recommend this album. I realize 'The Seeds' have been accused of sounding redundant in much of their song material, but I happen to like their simple style, so if there was just one of their album's to check out, I would say this one. Well assembled twenty track disc of The Seed's repertoire between 1965-67. Duration of CD, 65:50. This is one of those lesser known '60's garage / psych bands that true fans of such can never completely let go of. Cuts that I was sort of taken away with were ""Satisfy You"", ""Pretty Girl"", the heavy psych ""Chocolate River"", ""Out Of The Question"", the title track ""Travel With Your Mind"", ""Flower Lady"", ""900 Million People Daily"" (great fuzz guitar), ""Nobody Spoil My Fun"" and the two versions of their sole hit ""Pushin' Too Hard"". Line-up: Sky Saxon - guitar, keyboards & vocals, Daryl Hooper - vocals, Jan Savage - lead guitar and Rick Andridge - drums. Will most likely appeal to fans of Music Machine, Barbarians, Chocolate Watchband and The Kingsmen. A should-have. This 20 song compilation of Seeds' standarts, outtakes, rehearsals and rare versions is better than you could expect. Maybe it's not a  best introduction to one of the most seminal garage rock bands, but it's a highly entertaining document, with strong feeling of music expression freedom. Opening ""Satisfy You"" is one of the best garage rock thunderous tracks i ever heard, sparring with most frenetic records by the Sonics or The Troggs. ""Pushing Too Hard"" is another gem, and is more famous single closing this album. In between there's a lot hit'n'miss items, most of them are easily to love with first listening.Totally, this compilation is not top-form Seeds, however it sounds impressively fresh and fun.","Alternative Rock,Oldies,Pop,Psychedelic Rock,Rock,Classic Rock",seeds enough said cd welcome treat us owned official releases needed cd companion piece earlierseeds cd featured first two one features best first two pushin hard personal favorite haunting wind blows hair good ones include satisfy flower lady assistant thousand shadows nobody spoil fun million people daily available first time uncut ten minute version rather mediocre though seeds actually recorded blues mistake didnt really affinity type material thankfully one included every winner arent complete failures either fans garage band psychedelic scenes enjoy really like particular seeds said cd welcome treat official releases needed cd companion companion piece piece cd featured features best hard personal favorite haunting wind blows hair good ones include satisfy flower lady assistant shadows spoil fun people daily available time uncut minute version mediocre seeds actually recorded blues mistake really affinity type type material material thankfully included winner complete complete failures failures fans garage garage band band psychedelic scenes enjoy really

383,754,B000000B62,"I purchased this album due to a song by the Ananda Project, ""Deep Transcendental."" To my good fortune were a total of three Chris Brann/Ananda Project collaborations! Even better, was how many of the songs caused me to daydream and reflect on past experiences. For example, song four, ""Tiger From Venus"" has such a good vibe to it that it reminded me of the great times (and some sad) I've had with many women from my past. From the uplifting guitar to the sound of Nicole Henry's emotional voice, this song captured my attention even more than the main song I bought the album for. TERRIFIC ALBUM! As a devout Feelies fan, I was psyched when I heard about Wake Ooloo, with Glen and Dave.  Their 1st album, &quot;Hear No Evil&quot;, picked up where the Feelies left off, with its hypnotic guitar licks and understated  vocals.  While Glen's guitar style can still be felt in &quot;What About  It&quot;, I think that the album has sort of a rushed feel to it.  Still, a  must have for any devout feelies fan. If you are a Feelies fan, it's easy to say this album doesn't sound like the Feelies.  Wake Ooloo is more of a rock band.  However, if you like the song-crafting of the primary Feelies singer/songwriter/guitarist, you'll hear the same quality on this album.  The song Beautiful Feeling is a good, slow electric song with really good electric guitar distortion stronger than anything the Feelies did.  The song Anything is really good - it could have been an acoustic Feelies song fromOnly Life, it just happens to use electric rhythm guitar.  Hard to Find and Monday Morning both sound likeTime for a Witness, and both really good.  Down That Road is a little different with a gentle bluesy slide guitar sound, but it's a really good song too.There are a couple of songs on this album I really don't like, but it doesn't matter because the others are good.","Alternative Rock,Folk Rock,Pop,Rock",purchased due ananda project deep transcendental good fortune total three chris brann ananda project collaborations even better many caused daydream reflect past experiences example four tiger venus good vibe reminded great times sad ive many women past uplifting guitar sound nicole henrys emotional voice captured attention even main bought terrific devout feelies fan psyched heard wake ooloo glen dave st quot hear evil quot picked feelies left hypnotic guitar licks understated vocals glens guitar style still felt quot quot think sort rushed feel still must devout feelies fan feelies fan easy purchased ananda project deep transcendental good good fortune fortune total chris ananda project collaborations better daydream reflect past experiences example tiger good vibe reminded great great times times sad women uplifting guitar sound nicole henrys henrys emotional voice captured attention main bought terrific devout fan psyched heard wake glen quot hear evil quot picked left hypnotic guitar guitar licks licks understated vocals glens guitar style felt quot quot think sort rushed feel devout fan fan easy

385,758,B000000B6E,"Something like the final product of setting the Communist Manifesto to the tunes from the first 2 They Might Be Giants records, jetting the results and a multitrack round-trip to the 19th century for Sergei Rachmaninoff to  record a version of, then giving his tapes to Faust (with special  guest-star Charles Ives) for extensive remixing. The disadvantage of these  comparson games is how useless they are if you don't know the referents, so  if that's you, well, this particular release has major-key left-wing  revolution jingles stretched on the rack into wondrously grandiose piano  pieces and interlaced with all kinds of weird strangely-tuned interrupting  riffs, drones, electronic jags, and other such eruptions. Occasionally  Cheer-Accident forget to redefine music in favor of ignoring musical  requirements altogether, but &quot;Vacuum&quot;'s buildup of interlocking  drones is a remarkable study in Krautrock construction (poor  frequent-replay value, but very worth hearing twice), and &quot;Dismantling  The Berlin Waltz&quot;, an actual song and the Platonic ideal of the sound  I've just been describing, has joined my all-time favorite songs shortlist  (but do hit forward-skip when the closing siren kicks in, 6:20  through).&quot;The Law Of Attraction&quot; is more Gastr Del Sol-like:  unperiodic strums, sounding like the bass notes of an autoharp with no key  selected, setting a thin high voice singing the oddly romantic &quot;We  collide at the intersection/ I fly through the windshield into your arms/  we embrace/ the ambulance sirens/ as the sound of metal is cut away/ we  display intermingled remains&quot;. &quot;Failure&quot;, on the other hand,  plays half its length as pop, like one of Ben Folds Five's serious numbers,  before evolving into the group sound and then into a peppy brass  arrangement. I've owned this album for 14 months as I write and it just now  is emerging among my most-played records of the moment. Some things take a  while to get past the &quot;Huh?&quot; stage. Cheer-Accident outdid themselves on this finely crafted work of art.  It's a listening experience, complete with droning noises, patchwork edits, and beautiful melodies.  Parts of it recall the ultra-poppy WHY ALBUM of a few years earlier; most of it is in a new realm of music, not often explored by anyone.  The band is one of the best I've ever witnessed in live performance, and they're as creative and varied as any musical artist in the history of modern music (i.e., the last eighty years or so).  If you don't own this record, buy it without regret.  And if you have any spare copies  of their old stuff on cassette and/or vinyl, send me an e-mail.","Alternative Rock,Metal,Pop,Rock",something like final product setting communist manifesto tunes first might giants records jetting results multitrack round trip th century sergei rachmaninoff record version giving tapes faust special guest star charles ives extensive remixing disadvantage comparson games useless dont know referents thats well particular release major key left wing revolution jingles stretched rack wondrously grandiose piano pieces interlaced kinds weird strangely tuned interrupting riffs drones electronic jags eruptions occasionally cheer accident forget redefine favor ignoring musical requirements altogether quot vacuum quot buildup interlocking drones remarkable study krautrock construction poor frequent replay value worth hearing twice quot dismantling berlin waltz q final final product product product setting setting communist communist manifesto manifesto tunes giants records jetting results multitrack round round trip trip century sergei sergei rachmaninoff rachmaninoff record version tapes special special guest star guest guest star star charles ives extensive remixing disadvantage games useless dont know referents release major key left left wing wing revolution jingles stretched rack wondrously grandiose piano pieces interlaced kinds weird strangely tuned interrupting riffs drones electronic jags eruptions occasionally cheer accident forget redefine favor ignoring musical requirements altogether vacuum quot buildup interlocking drones remarkable study krautrock construction poor frequent replay replay value value worth hearing twice dismantling berlin waltz

They love singing and reminiscing about the good old days. Got it for my mom who still watches the rerums of Lawrence Welk on TV. She loved it! We like music--and need some discs of dance music for our senior dance. This is best for senior dancers because we are familiar with is kind of music Not a fan, but my father-in-law really, really, really loves it.This is classic 1940s-50s swing and big band stuff. I watched the Lawrence Welk Show for years and always waited to hear the big band pieces. The musicians were always superb. A lot of corny comments have come out of this show, but how can you argue with 29 consecutive years on TV!! All studio cats, these guys played together for years which produced a cohesive, clean sound. Their phrasing, intonation, and time is magnificent. This is a great CD for anyone who wants to be introduced to classic, big band music. Even the vocals are wonderful and crystal clear. The singer's intonation also is fantastic.Enjoy If you are a fan of the Big Band era and enjoy the Lawrence Welk band, then you will enjoy this CD. If you love the big sound, you will truly enjoy this CD. Hardly a weak number in the whole lot. Bought this CD for my 85 year old father who watches the Welk Show every Saturday night.  He LOVES this CD.  Listens to it everyday and enjoys dancing around the house with my mother.  I'm sooo glad I got it for them. I enjoy the olde and goodie music of yesteryear.

387,760,B000000B8K,"The product was in excellent condition, just what I wanted and I received it a timely manner.  I am completely satisfied and would do business again with this company without hesitation.  thank you. Ranwood's nonexistent documentation fails to disclose that these are NOT the vaunted original recordings we might expect but rerecordings dating from the final years of Vaughn's semiretirement. All the usual suspects are included in their familiar arrangements in true (if cramped) stereo but the band is noticeably smaller, probably recruited off the streets and not from the studio-musician elite of Hollywood. Vaughn completists might relish the rarity ""Sway,"" and the scaled-down ""Blue tango"" actually works, in a tawdry way befitting this release marketed at full price to unsuspecting buyers. Admittedly the unflattering cover photography of Vaughn modeling the world's ugliest hairpiece provides a clue to the provenance of these tracks: great arrangements, subpar presentation. Avoid it like the plague and seek out worthier compilations, from Germany or the Netherlands, of the original tracks. Billy Vaughn was the original A&amp;R men, along with Randy Wood at Dot  Records. He helped bring DOT Records into the  national spotlight by  producing all of Pat Boone, Gale Storm, The Hilltoppers and almost everyone  that recorded for the label. This selection of his greatest hits includes  &quot;Sail Along Silvery Moon&quot; which is a true classic. Virtually  every selection on this package brings back a wealth of classic memories.  If you love the classic pop sounds of the 50's this &quot;Best Of&quot;  should be high on your list. I am trying to find a CD that lives up to my memories of a Billy Vaughn LP from the early 1960's (I believe the word ""golden"" was in the title and that the cover showed Billy V. with a shining saxophone), so admittedly I start with a bias.  This CD is quite enjoyable, but a little too sweet for my taste (e.g. tracks 2 and 3!).  I miss the gutsy, exhilarating sax playing that I recall from that earlier recording, particularly in cuts such as ""Sail along silv'ry moon,"" even though this one is in stereo.  However, ""In the mood"" is rightly wonderfully infectious.  I agree with the Music Fan from Alaska about the liner notes.  The skinny pamphlet sadly adds very little to the information available on the back cover.  Surely much interesting material is available on a career as long and impressive as that of Billy Vaughn's, so, Ranwood, please share it with us!

389,764,B000000BES,"It is as thrilling to listen to this album as it was to see Ann Hampton Callaway perform in person.  She is electric, vibrant, and extremely talented.  I played this album for my 19 year old son who thought he wouldn't like her.  When Ann began to scat; my son's jaw dropped!  He made me play it again and then play it for his dad (who is a jazz nut).  She is now a family favorite!  See her in person if you ever get the chance; but in the meantime, but this album.  She is superb!! Ella would be thrilled to hear this one! This is a tribute to both artists and an album that will get lots of play at my house. Callaway's range, clarity and original delivery make her one of our most talented musicians and while listening to her is an exceptional treat watching her perform is even more amazing. I can't get enough of her. Recently saw Ann in person with the Cleveland Jazz Orchestra.  Album is excellent, and seeing her performance in person was outstanding. I can say but a few words, Read the reviews on Ann, find the ones that sound the best and closest to the type of music you enjoy and it's a done deal. Buy her CD's or CD's and You will not be disappointed.I love her Blues & Jazz CD's best but that's my favorite type of music..She is just incredible at what she does.She will make you smile and cry....Go for it Ms Ann I think you are great. Ann Hampton Callaway and her cadre of talented musicians have captured the sound and spirit of jazz at its best.Ella Fitzgerald lives in the voice of Ann Hampton Callaway. Wynton Marsalis would make Louis Armstrong proud.  I can't say enough good about this CD.All lovers of quality music do  yourself a favor and purchase this album! This is my first CD of Ann Hampton Callaway.I was lucky enough to get and try this cd in one of our stores. Jazz, especially good jazz cds, are very rare to find in the philippines. Especially now, many artists are trying to piggy back on the commercial success of michael buble. Most &quot;jazz&quot; cds capitalize on the band wagon.However, Miss Callaway is an ORIGINAL. Though this cd is a tribute to ella, ann hampton is able to give this a unique spin. her voice is simply elegant and amazing.the way she shifts from low note to high note is amazing. it also helps that the band is excellent.Currently, i only have two cds of hers, this one and &quot;easy living&quot;. it is nice to know now that many of her cds are available online. I did not think I would care all that much for this album. I bought it only because I really like Ann Hampton Callaway and wanted to give it a chance. I'm glad I did and it was worth it!As the title implies, this is a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald. These were Ella songs but Ann has made them hew own. A few, like ""I got it bad"", evoke the original but for the most part, these are done in Callaway's own impressive style. It is a product that she can be proud of and which Ella Fitzgerald can be proud of as well. For the most part, the tempos a slowed down a bit from those which Fitzgerald would have used but that fits Callaway's style. In short, it works. Having been a fan of both Ella and Ann the fusion of them intrigued me. With Ella's ownership as a premise, this album surely took some getting used to. But in its own way, Ann's redefinition of the songs is sublime. One of my absolute favorites being ""That Old Black Magic"", which (imho) has never been done quite as beautifully as on this album. The missing star is due to the 'unoriginality' any cover-album bears with it. Still, Ann's love for Ella shines through very clearly, which makes her - and this album - even more endearing. For a young, white, contemporary singer to attempt the tunes of the legendary Ella would seem impossible and vaguely insulting and it would be if all she did was attempt but Ann Hampton Callaway succeeds. And Lord how she swings! Turn down the lights, stir up the fire and let the sound wrap around you like a soft, warm blanket. Jazz at its best cuts to the emotions like laser and the Callaway variety burns brighter than any other living singer. You should have this CD. If you don't there is a big hole in your life but you can fill it with a single decision. Buy &quot;To Ella: With Love.&quot; Another great find from the Thrift store, thanks sweetly. The CD I got has a different front cover from the one pictured in Amazon. I must have an older copy which was recorded in Estonia 1996. Of coarse this is tribute to Ella Fitzgerald & Ann Callaway sings with her own style but at times strains the low notes. All the famous songs are here: Let's Fall in Love, A Fine Romance, Embraceable You etc...Wynton Marsalis  guest solos on trumpet with Cyrus Chestnut on piano, Christian McBride on bass, & Lewis Nash on drums with a small orchestra behind them. The recording is rather centered with little outside space. In other words there is no difference between the speakers, it almost sounds mono. Some great scatting in ""How High The Moon"" with Wynton following. Time for a little old time romance. I agree, this is one of Ann's best recordings, and I have them all.  She's flawless - pitch always right on; and totally creative in her style.  To top it off she's backed by a stellar group of musicians. I've always enjoyed Ella and her approach to a song, so I can understand why Ann made this tribute album.  The songs are well-chosen, tunes with melodies and lyrics befitting the chops of both artists.  But when chops enter the discussion, no one comes close to Ann.  Her rich musical imagination coupled with a beyond human vocal range makes the listener stop everything and just...well listen.  While listening to this CD in my car, I had to pull over and give Ann my undivided attention.  Wait until you hear her scatting and her original lyrics.  You, too, will find yourself focused on Ann's artistry to the point of turning off the paraphernalia which unfortunately steals our energies.  Ann brings music to new levels.Unfortunately Amazon's cloud refuses to play this album for me.  Since March 18, I've been asking Amazon's techies to fix the problem.  So far not. Ann Hampton Callaway is probably best known for her more intimate appearances on the New York cabaret circuit which often hosts other sophisticated and uncommonly talented vocalists such as Barbara Cook, Andrea Marcovicci, Jessica  Molasky,Jane Monheit, Micheal Feinstein, K.T. Sullivan,and others. The concert stages shared by such talents as Streisand, Dion and other international recording stars is not her venue, so if you're not familiar with her and you enjoy great jazz styling coupled with a stylized somewhat swinging version of the American Songbook, reminiscent of the late Ella Fitzgerald, you should buy this CD. It comprises a wonderful songlist and if you were to own just one CD by this atist, this is the one to own.STANBOBRAP A bit hysterical and baroque, but the talent is undeniable.","Oldies,Jazz,Traditional Vocal Pop,Traditional Pop,Pop,Traditional Jazz & Ragtime,Broadway & Vocalists,Vocal Pop",thrilling listen see ann hampton callaway perform person electric vibrant extremely talented played year old son thought wouldnt like ann began scat sons jaw dropped made play play dad jazz nut family favorite see person ever get chance meantime superb ella would thrilled hear one tribute artists get lots play house callaways range clarity original delivery make one talented musicians listening exceptional treat watching perform even amazing cant get enough recently saw ann person cleveland jazz orchestra excellent seeing performance person outstanding say words read reviews ann find ones sound th thrilling listen see ann ann hampton callaway hampton perform person electric vibrant extremely talented played year old son thought ann began scat sons jaw dropped play play dad jazz nut family favorite see person chance meantime superb thrilled hear tribute artists lots play play house house range clarity original delivery talented musicians listening exceptional treat watching perform amazing recently saw ann person jazz jazz orchestra orchestra excellent seeing performance person outstanding say words read reviews ann find ones sound
390,766,B000000BQT,"If you need a break from the manufactured ""country radio"" sound, try Eddy Raven.  Right before the surge of music videos, Eddy was very popular.  Eddy hails from Louisiana and he is considered rock/country/cajun and blues.I learned about him from the old Country Music Television programs where he played many of his number one hits.  He has great tapping footwork when he performs.  He writes a lot of his music.  Especially fun is ""Bayou Boys""  One of the most beautiful and my all time ever favorite song is ""Island"".  There was a music video to that song that was even more beautiful.  .....Excellent CD....Rizzo Eddy Raven is one of those artists that has been lost to todays radio. What a shame because this is what country music is all about and is truly the ""backbone"" of country. Lets not forget the past! The first 5 songs on this cd are new.  My favorite of them is Rip Rap Road.  The other four songs are all good also though. The rest of the 13 songs are hits that he has put on other cds.  And my favorites of those are Sometimes A Lady.  which is one of my favorite Eddy Raven songs.  And Bayou boys.  And he does his version of his own Thank God For Kids.  This is a good cd that would have been better with more new songs. This CD contains some of Eddy Raven's best songs. My personal favorite is &quot;In a Letter to You.&quot; It's a great collection of fun, toe-tapping, good dancing music, suitable for any country lover's library.

The only disappointment  was that they didn't include the song &quot;SLYDE&quot;.Cameo is an  original. Unlike most of today's groups, they are musicians.They had nine  or more people in the group at one point.

393,771,B000000BTP,"I absolutely love this CD. I play this all the time. I especially love tracks 13 and 14. This is my favorite band and favorite CD. I can assure you that you will not be disappointed if you purchase this Live and Well  CD. What a great way for the Gap Band to come back. Charlie will always be  the man. This live album is just that, &quot;LIVE&quot;!  The band is alive and enchanting, taking the audience on a musical journey that few of them probably imagined while on the way to the show.From the opening  annoucement, to the ending of the shoo-be mix of &quot;Yearning&quot;, you  can't help but bob your head and STOMP your feet.  Charlie Wilson reminds  you why artists such as R. Kelly, Aaron Hall, Stokley (of Mint Condition),  Johnny Gill, and many others have picked up his style.If you love to  &quot;see&quot; the performance you &quot;hear&quot; then you should  already have this in your live album collection.  What,you're still  readiing this?!  Get going...! I play this albumn every day, in my car and at home. I exercise with it, I groove with it, I pretend I am part of the band. When will these extraordinarly talented brothers and their band get their due recognition? If I am down, all I have to do is put this cd or any one of their others cd's and I am out of my bad funk and groovin in the good funk.I just saw them perform two weeks ago at the San Diego Sports Arena and the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine and they kicked [bottom]. Charlie is the sexiest thing on the planet and what a performer. I was in heaven for two nights in a row.And what a class act they are. At the end of one of the performances they brought their Dad on stage. It was very moving.And Charlie's message to all of us, a Gap Band concert ain't nothing but a party. No place for violence or anything else. Ain't nothing but a party...From a committed GAPPER for eternity.P.S. See y'all in the Rock In Roll Hall Of Fame... I PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT FOR FRIEND OF MINE AT WORK..HE WAS AMAZED THAT I WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT NICE FOR HIM...BUT HE LOVES THIS LITTLE CD AND PROBABLY WILL END UP WEARING IT OUT..IF THATS POSSIBLE I have been looking for this CD (The Gap Band Live & Well)for a few years now and boy I am grooving to the beat!! Also I'm impressed on how fast the CD came to me Thank you..

394,772,B000000BTT,"Crystal Gayle is known to many but not to enough.  Many of my friends thought her style was all akin to the DON'T IT MAKE MY BROWN EYES BLUE sound.  Alas, not only is Crystal Gayle's talent so much beyond that, but  in this work- a collection of beautiful and traditional Christmas songs-  her smooth vocals and eloquent enunciations put the finishing touches on  songs that will never sound the same to you again.Once you hear the  songs, all joined together by choice in varying melody, you will want to  hear it again and again.  I have made copies of this tape for so many of my  friends and family.  Some love the way she does certain songs, such as THE  LITTLE DRUMMER BOY; others love what she DOES with certain songs, such as  HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS.  The usual response I hear is,  &quot;Wow, I didn't know she could sing like that!&quot;.  Beyond her range  and dramatic ability, however, the album exemplifies her golden, lush,  smooth voice.  She can melt you like ice cream on a July day, and what's  more, the selection of songs is something that especially children will  warm to and love.On the other hand, Crystal grew up and recorded in days  when artists didn't pour sixty minutes into an album.  As a result, these  selections go very fast if you're watching the clock.  Granted, Christmas  songs are sometimes short to begin with; so, perhaps I've always been left  with wanting just a bit more.  But that's the price you pay when you find  someone this talented:  you cannot get enough!! This is one christmas album that is truly worth keeping. Crystal Gayle's voice is as mellow as it can be. Her voice is simply amazing!! As Lawrence Welk would say ""wonderful, wonderful, wonderful"" truly describes this Christmas album. However, before paying collector price for this CD check on Amazon and see if the reissue is available instead. The reissue, on the Laserlight label, consists of exactly the same recordings only in difference sequence. The reissue currently sells brand new for around $4 which, if you check the current prices for this edition, is about less than 1/10th of the current asking price for a new copy. The quality of the recordings are identical as they were both pressed from the same masters. So, unless you're a purist and absolutely must have the original release, you'll be getting a terrific bargain on a terrific CD by purchasing the reissue. The current listing on Amazon for the reissue is listed as Crystal Christmas while this album is listed as A Crystal Christmas - drop the ""A"" and do a search and it will show up. Or follow the link I have attached to this review.Crystal Christmas I gave this to my niece on Christmas Eve to replace her old worn-out music cassette of 1996, played in many seasons, and she simply beamed at me in disbelief and started hearing it immediately! This exact Crystal Gayle collection is HER real way to feel Christmas sentiments. Needless to say I listened to it umpteen times before I gave it away while I decorated my place....Delivery was in a timely manner and although the CD was a used one there is no problem with it. (Good deal - the product was less expensive than shipping).I also bought the newer version of the collection, more recently remastered in 2006 which - at first - I did not like as much. But hearing it over and over I found that I even preferred it to the &#34;old&#34; one. Be it as it may, both CD's are a great addition to my Christmas entertainment and I say: Go for it!","Noels,Country,Pop,Holiday & Wedding,Today's Country,Opera & Classical Vocal,Vocal Non-Opera,Christmas",crystal gayle known many enough many friends thought style akin dont make brown eyes blue sound alas crystal gayles talent much beyond work collection beautiful traditional christmas smooth vocals eloquent enunciations put finishing touches never sound hear joined together choice varying melody want hear made copies tape many friends family love way certain little drummer boy others love certain merry little christmas usual response hear quot wow didnt know could sing like quot beyond range dramatic ability however exemplifies golden lush smooth voice melt like ice cream july day whats selection crystal gayle known friends thought style akin brown brown eyes eyes blue sound crystal gayles talent work collection beautiful traditional christmas smooth vocals eloquent enunciations finishing finishing touches touches sound hear joined choice varying melody want hear copies tape friends family love way little drummer boy drummer drummer boy boy love merry merry little christmas little christmas christmas usual response hear quot wow know sing quot range dramatic ability exemplifies golden lush smooth voice melt ice ice cream cream july day whats selection
395,773,B000000BUQ,"Con Funk Shun is one of my favorite r&amp;b/quiet storm groups of the 1970's.  At one time I had ALL of their albums.  I think that the albums &quot;Spirit of Love&quot;, &quot;Touch&quot;, and &quot;7&quot; were their very best &quot;total package&quot; efforts.  I would like to obtain a copy of &quot;7&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot; and &quot;Loveshine&quot; again (hint for anyone who can help with a cassette tape copy).Anyway, this live recording contains a good sample of Con Funk Shun's best material.  The new members of the group don't miss a beat.  I am curious as to what happened to the other original members: Cedric Martin/bass, Louis McCall/drums and Danny Tho mas/keyboards.  I had the pleasure of meeting Cedric Martin after a concert in Cleveland, Ohio in @1978.  There is nothing so great as live horns and this album has plenty of that in the Ffun intro segueing into Chase Me.  The bass is booming and popping with Michael Cooper and Felton &quot;Clyde&quot; Pilate still doing great justice on vocals.There are many, many jams that they could have done on this cd but the representation is good.  Personaly, I like Candy, Got to Be Enough, Touch, Body Lovers, Ms. Got-the-body and Do Ya.  But these guys do a super job of mixing it up between fast jams and ballads.The slow jams are awesome!!!  Let Me Put Love on Your Mind and Love's Train are mega-BEGGING songs and I was very pleased to see Straight From the Heart on this list... it is a very beatiful song and reminds me of my youngest daughter who died tragically 10 years ago at the age of 8.5 months. I use this song to express the love of a father to his young daughter... with all the hopes and dreams we all have for our children... only to see them sadly dashed away.  Probably not the original intent of the song, but it works for me.  I'm Leaving Baby and Baby, I'm Hooked are good choices too, but I would like to have heard Honey Wild, Make It Last, Can't Say Goodbye, Give You love To Me or their first slow jam Another World.The inclusion of By Your Side with the instrumental solos and introductions of the band members is a brief taste of the true musicianship these guys had during the 70's.  Remember Indian Summer Love, California 1, Foley Park, If You're In Need, and Play Widit?Of course, they HAD to end the live segment of the cd with Ffun appropriately.  Throw It Up is a nice take on George &quot;Dukey Stick&quot; Duke's popular Reach for It.  The mega-mix could have been left off the cd as far as I'm concerned because when you start to listen to it, it sounds so good you want to skip back  and hear the entire song again not just small clips!!!I'd love to see this band live again, but since I live in New England now and these guys are California bred, that seems like a very remote possibility.  In the meantime, I'm glad to hear that they have gotten back together and are doing some shows.Wow... the 1970's sure produced a lot of enjoyable, clean r&amp;b to listen and dance to.  This is a refreshing taste worthy to be added to any collection. If you are looking for pre-recorded vocals, overdubs and pre-recorded beats then pass this by - but if you want REAL music played LIVE, with the energy and drive of a bad a$$ band, then look no further. This LIVE recording is dripping with Funk and features the great vocals of Felton and Michael and the ever-so-funky bass playing of Eric Young.  Be sure pick up this CD AND check the band out the next time they are in your town! I was pleasantly surprised. Not a real fan of Confunkshun, except for 'Love Train' but the concert kept me listening. So, yes, I recommend this one for those who like ""live' concerts. You won't be disappointed. Now, can we get a video? Michael and Felton takes you on a musical journey that you will never forget.  This is a great buy for all old schoolers. Con Funk Shun is blazing on this Live set.The Band is sounding Great.FFun hearing those Horns sounds great.all the jams here&amp;more.a truly rewarding great Live set.It's Funky&amp;Blazing.","Soul,Pop,Quiet Storm,R&B,Blues,Funk",con funk shun one favorite r amp b quiet storm groups one time think quot spirit love quot quot touch quot quot quot best quot total package quot efforts would like obtain copy quot quot quot candy quot quot loveshine quot hint anyone help cassette tape copy anyway live recording contains good sample con funk shuns best material new members group dont miss beat curious happened original members cedric martin bass louis mccall drums danny tho mas keyboards pleasure meeting cedric martin concert cleveland ohio nothing great live horns plenty ffun intro segueing chase bass booming popping michael cooper felton quot clyde quot pilate still great justice vocals many many jams coul con funk shun funk shun favorite amp quiet quiet storm storm groups time think quot spirit love quot quot touch quot quot quot best quot total package quot efforts like obtain copy quot quot quot candy quot quot quot hint help cassette cassette tape tape copy live recording contains good sample con funk shuns funk shuns best material new members group miss beat curious happened original members martin bass louis drums keyboards pleasure meeting martin concert cleveland cleveland ohio ohio great live horns plenty ffun intro segueing chase bass booming popping michael michael cooper felton quot quot great justice vocals jams
396,774,B000000BVG,"Anyone who loves a great singer will go crazy over this awesome DIVA collection of magnificent performances by the greatest singer on the planet who happens to be the music industry best kept secret and never understood why!  Vocally this extraordinary singer can sing circles around anyone alive today, leaving them gasping for air or running for stage exit, always right on target getting to emotional core of a song, soaring to the sky or equally at home with a soft smoldering ballad. ""On & On"" is a phenomenal mix of everything this amazing singer can do, every song done to complete perfection with those glorious breathtaking vocals captivating. Mesmerizing rousing opener ""Let Jesus Love You"" finds Jennifer singing with depth and passion towering brilliantly over majestic gospel choir and this stunner is just the opener! Wild organ/keyboard arrangement compliment a soulful Jennifer who goes full throttle making ""I'll Praise His Name"" a riveting gem with great support from a full gospel choir with everyone in peak form. A gorgeous and heartfelt ballad ""To Teach Me"" reveals this stellar singer's extraordinary vocal beauty, making this soul-deep breathtaking classic a memorable listening experience that is incomparable.  Like a great ride in a amusement park, the remarkable title song ""On & On"" is a stunner that flows then builds to amazing crescendos becoming Jennifer's magical musical tour-de-force that hopefully received a deserved Grammy Award, if not those folks are really out of it! Any true music lover will find this collection totally stunning and must be one of the greatest ever Gospel recordings by a major recording artist and Tony Award Winner. Gutsy, soulful and completely inspiring ""In Spite Of It All"" finds the legendary singer doing some amazing things in the upper range of her unique gorgeous voice, then rocking out in the driving rhythmic ""Show Some Sign"", ""Healing Hands"" is a masterful power-ballad featuring a smooth yet powerful vocal from Jennifer, showing this lady should be at the top of the music industry and Billboard charts!  Imagine this voice doing Motion Picture Themes, Miss Holliday would be awesome creating memorable classics that would be sure to win Oscar for Best Song.  Another exhilirating performance ""It Is Well With My Soul"" has Jennifer taking the lucky listener on a brilliant musical journey ride of a lifetime on that glorious voice in just under ten minutes of pure bliss...beautiful spiritual celebration grand finale ""Hallelujah, Amen!"" closes out one of the best vocal collections ever... Bravo Jennifer Holliday and thank you for this magnificent masterpiece that ultimately is a timeless collection of ""Master Class"" performances! Jennifer Holliday returns to her gospel roots here in a way that makes it clear that she never really left.  Every form of inspirational music is impeccably displayed in &quot;On &amp; On&quot; - a feat few recording artists -gospel or secular- manage in their chosen genre. From soft, reflective ballads, to more rousing, mid-tempo numbers that give hint to her powerful voice like a Mustang idling at a traffic light, she thoughtfully and strategically tunes the listener up.  By the end of the CD, we are given what I suspect she knows we were waiting for: a gut-wrenching, heart-stopping, truly &quot;gospel&quot; piece.  Her spirit-filled testimonial cover of the gospel standard &quot;It Is Well With My Soul&quot; deserved a Grammy, Stellar, Dove among other awards.  For that number alone, I know she will be richly rewarded in heaven.  For old faithful J.H. fans, such as myself, and newcomers just discovering this awesome vocalist, &quot;On &amp; On&quot; proves to be, pe! rhaps, the best display of Jennifer Holliday's amazing talent yet.  With writer/producers the likes of Richard Smallwood, Orlando Draper, Diane Warren and others, Jennifer definitely came ready to make an (exclamation) point!  In my view, this is a &quot;must-listen.&quot; Jennifer Holliday is one of the greatest underrated talents of our time. Her powerhouse voice is perfect for Broadway and Gospel style music.  That being said, this album is straight ahead gospel and displays her passion for the subject matter. The album is a bit low budget and the insrumental accompaniment is keyboard synthesizers, but it was produced for the love of the music. Some of the songs contain spoken sermon introductions but they really don't deter from the performances here. The label distrubuting this cd probably doesn't have an art department, which explains the rather spartan and somewhat dated photograph of Jennifer with unusually big hair. Never judge a book by it's cover.","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Soul,Pop,Quiet Storm,R&B,Gospel",anyone loves great singer go crazy awesome diva collection magnificent performances greatest singer planet happens industry best kept secret never understood vocally extraordinary singer sing circles around anyone alive today leaving gasping air running stage exit always right target getting emotional core soaring sky equally home soft smoldering ballad phenomenal mix everything amazing singer every done complete perfection glorious breathtaking vocals captivating mesmerizing rousing opener let jesus love finds jennifer singing depth passion towering brilliantly majestic gospel choir stunner opener wild organ keyboard arrangement compliment soulful jennifer goes full throttle making ill praise name riveting gem great support full gospel choir everyon loves great singer go crazy crazy awesome diva collection magnificent performances greatest singer planet happens industry best kept secret understood vocally extraordinary singer sing circles alive today leaving gasping air running stage exit right target emotional core soaring sky equally home soft smoldering ballad phenomenal mix amazing singer complete complete perfection perfection glorious vocals captivating mesmerizing rousing opener let jesus love finds jennifer singing depth passion towering brilliantly majestic gospel gospel choir choir stunner opener wild organ keyboard arrangement compliment soulful jennifer full throttle ill praise riveting gem great support full full gospel gospel gospel choir choir

I got this cd brand new and at a bargain price (3.00). What a steal that was. First of all, it has some great songs from the 80's that I've never seen on a compilation such as the mysterious ""Captain of her heart"", one of the best hits of the 80's. ""Could've been"" by Tiffiny is a sweet song. If she knew what she wants by the Bangles is in my opinon their best song.Heart and Soul by T'Pau is sexy.

399,781,B000000CDV,"Run DMC is arguably the most influential group in rap, and Raising Hell was the album that made them famous back in 1986.  This singles-oriented album had classics like ""Peter Piper"" and the timeless song ""It's Tricky"", and at the same time, set trends in hip-hop footwear with ""My Adidas"", and helped rap crossover into the mainstream with ""Walk This Way"", a rap-ified remake of the Aerosmith classic.  Emcees Run and DMC were both capable of delivering meaningful lyrics like in the socially conscious song ""Proud to be Black"", but at the same time, they show they know how to have fun and rock a party with songs like ""Hit it Run"" and ""You be Illin'"".  Run and DMC also gave birth to the tag-team rhyming used by other great rap groups such as the Beastie Boys and Outkast.  Jam Master Jay was a genius in his own right, using a fair number of samples to perfection, not to mention his sick turntable skills.Since this album IS singles-oriented, the filler isn't all that great, and that's where this album loses a star.  The filler isn't exactly wack, but songs like ""Perfection"" sound underproduced, and ""Dumb Girl"", though humourous, is pretty dumb.  It's not wack by any means, but it could have been better.  Filler aside, this is one of the best rap albums of all time, it's all great music for party-goers and hip-hop heads alike. I remember when I was young listening to this album like whoa,thinking to myself ""does it get any better than this"".NO it really doesnt, RUN-DMC & JAM MASTER JAY (R.I.P) took it to a whole new level you could'nt help but love this album it has something for everyone!!!They definetly made their mark in the rap world,paved the way for alot of other cats too.TRUE PIONEERS OF THIS DIRTY RAP GAME!!! FOREVER RUN-D.M.C.&JAM MASTER JAY The best hip hop album of all time with the top DJ in the genre.  A staple of my childhood and should be in any hip hop fan's collection. This is where Run DMC reached their peak. At the University of South Carolina at the time, this album and the beastie Boys &quot;License to Ill&quot; were heard everywhere. Rap was still fun and rappers were still not taking themselves too seriously.Now for the songs. I DEFY anyone to sit still while listening to &quot;Peter Piper&quot; or &quot;My Adidas.&quot; &quot;Proud To Be Black&quot; is a bit more tounge-in-cheek than the &quot;afrocentric&quot; rappers of a few years later. Yes, there is &quot;Walk This Way&quot; (sorry, I prefer the original), but most people don't know that rappers had been sampling this beat before rap was recorded. &quot;Perfection&quot; is wonderful in that it has our heroes doing a relaxed rap with a live 16-year old drummer named Stix in the background, with an interesting effect.But enough of this. Get this and Run DM's self-titled debut to hear how much fun rap was in the pre-gangsta era. Rap was getting real hot in the mid-1980's with artists like the Fat Boys,LL Cool J,and of course,Run D.M.C. Of course on this album,we hear the digital percussion but no ""beatbox"" like on some of the Fat Boys' recordings. The biggest hit from this album is a cover of Aerosmith's 1975 hit WALK THIS WAY. Here,Aerosmith members guitarist Joe Perry and frontman Steven Tyler give Run D.M.C. moral support. This even appears on Aerosmith's 2002 compilation O YEAH! ULTIMATE AEROSMITH HITS. The LP cover came in various colors just like Michael Jackson's INVINCIBLE and Hall & Oates' ROCK AND SOUL PART 1(later retitled GREATEST HITS). Awesome album! In my opinion, this is easliy the best album ever.  I bought it when it came out in 1986, and it is even better now.  After listening to &quot;Raising Hell&quot; all the way through changed the way I listened to music.  A perfect blend of rap and hard rock, the way rap is supposed to be.  Run and DMC are the best MC's out there, and no one scratches vinyl like Jam Master Jay.  You cannot call yourself a fan of rap if you have never heard this album--or if you don't like this album.  Every rapper of today owes it to Run-DMC for making rap mainstream.  So do yourself a favor and listen to this and I'll promise to shut up! A lo largo de varios a&ntilde;os he podido comprobar que Zoverstocks es uno de los proveedores mas serios en plazos de entrega, calidad del producto y estado del mismo This is the most essential rap album of all time. This is the one that every old-school rap fan should have. All songs are great, with Run and D turning out their legendary razor-sharp lyrics and catchy beats. The classic 'Walk This Way'(w/Aerosmith), 'Peter Piper' with rhymes as fast and sharp as an f-16 jet. 'It's Tricky' and 'My Adidas' were the other songs to get heavy radio play. Run and D pull off a stunning beat-box on 'Hit It Run'. My fav song on the album is the title track, 'Raising Hell'. That song is just absolutely fantastic, the mix of rock and rap make listening the ultimate experience on that song. In my opinion, this is THE best rap album of all-time. Some have come close, but none can measure up to ""Raising Hell"". This album was the trend setter, fusing rap and rock in a dazzling array of 12 songs. Run, D, and Jam Master Jay are the true pioneers of rap, and this is a must have for all rap fans. If you don't have it, get it. ROCK ON! You want to listen to real hip-hop? Not the stuff that calls itself rap and hip-hop music that is all over the radio and MTV but real, honest, fun hip-hop? Then you need to not look any further then Run DMC.I am not a big fan of rap, but I am a big fan of this disc. With only two MC's and one DJ(the late, great Jam Master Jay), &quot;Raising Hell&quot; is as full and real as any record you are likely to hear. These guys didn't need any big, elaborate porduciton to make you like their record, nor did they need fake bravodo and machoism. All they need is a crate of records and two mics with some of the best rhymes you are liable to hear.I mean, go down the list. &quot;It's Tricky&quot;, &quot;Peter Piper&quot;, &quot;Walk this Way&quot;, &quot;My A.d.i.d.a.s.&quot;, &quot;Porud to be Black&quot;. There isn't a song on here that isn't cool and worth listening to on repeat.If you like your hip-hop with trite lyrics about jewlery, fast cars, gangsta stories that are stale and dull, then you should not buy &quot;Raising Hell&quot;. But if you like music that is fun to listen to as well as interesting, then &quot;Raising Hell&quot; is for you. Screw genre. This is just a great album. This was the first rap tape I got when I was about ten and unlike most hip hop records that go out of style in a few years, i find myself coming back to this time and time again.  This album was definitely way before it's  time.  It was great then, it's great now and it will be bumping into the  new millenium! Where there's only 10 reviews for Raising Hell? A world where I'm getting old, I guess. To anyone who has ever listened to commercial rap, and is glad for the hip-hop movement as it is today, respect MUST be paid to  Reverend Run, DMC, and Jay as pioneers in appealing to a wide audience.  They didn't invent rap, they just made it a cultural force. If it weren't  for Run DMC Snoop Dogg would still be Calvin Broadus, rapping in his garage  and trying to make ends meet. How glad hip-hop fans should be that's not  the case. Steven Tyler is pretty kool on this rap album! I remember this all the way back in 1986.  Its alright. Condition of the album is great and of course this is a hip hop classic, so I had to have it. Yes.  For a third album, this one got even better!  They still managed to keep the same hard-core sound but advance it into a newer time.Now, as I review this album, I will point out that there are TWO memories of this album - the white one (Walk this Way and It's Tricky) and the black one(the rest of the album).  I will of course give everyone the black point of view.I must do this because everytime this album is relfected upon, it is ALWAYS in the context of ""Walk this Way"" only.  I am here to argue that this album hit BEFORE ""Walk this Way"" was to be released.The good:  This album hit on the streets alreasy because of ""Peter Piper"" and ""My Adidas"" which were release prior to the album.  Street classics are: everything but ""Walk this Way.""  This album was one of the rare damn near perfect albums.  Every song was hot.  This album blew up in the streets, but was served to ""others.""  If you can get away with such a formula, cool.  The streets kind of got left out since all of the press was about ""Walk this Way"" and ""it's Tricky.""  It was almost like ""let's invest our money and time into the white audience and let the streets(blacks) just listen to it however.""The Bad:  It seems as if whites and especially MTV and VH1(Viacom) only want you to remember this album for what white people liked about it - Aerosmith.  If the album was not as hot as it was, I would almost take it out of my collection because of how they catagorize it.  That cover shows what was on their minds while making the album.  I wonder if whites or many others would see Run-DMC as the hip-hop beatles if it were not for that one song.  The hip-hop world would have still seen them that way.  Although there is EPMD...I can't stand it when they review this album for that one song and dismiss the hard-core hip-hop classics of the rest of it.  Run DMC was a rare group who had four strong albums of similar strenth.  Rare indeed. You have to give them credit but still you can't judge them on that. Their ryhmes can't compare to the master 2pac or 50 cent. I think everyone who floats it with hip hop knows that these kids blew it by getting involved with Aerosmith. Rock n Roll and drugs were never meant to mix with rap. This music needed to be about bling, [...] and guns while rock needed to be about drugs, cars and [...]. Praise them if you want but tell me you would'nt rather listen to Public Enemy or Starsailor. By their third album, Run-D.M.C. were primed for a breakthrough into the mainstream, but nobody was prepared for a blockbuster on the level of Raising Hell. Run-D.M.C. and King of Rock had established the crew's fusion of hip-hop and hard rock, but that sound didn't blossom until Raising Hell, partially due to the presence of Rick Rubin as producer. Rubin loved metal and rap in equal measures and he knew how to play to the strengths of both, while slipping in commercial concessions that seemed sly even when they borrowed from songs as familiar as ""My Sharona"" (heard on ""It's Tricky""). Along with longtime Run-D.M.C. producer Russell Simmons, Rubin blew down the doors of what hip-hop could do with Raising Hell because it reached beyond rap-rock and found all sorts of sounds outside of it. Sonically, there is simply more going on in this album than any previous rap record, more hooks, more drum loops, more scratching, more riffs, more of everything. Where other rap records, including Run-D.M.C.'s, were all about the rhythm, this is layered with sounds and ideas, giving the music a tangible flow. But the brilliance of this record is that even with this increased musical depth, it still rocks as hard as hell, and in a manner that brought in a new audience. Of course, the cover of Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way,"" complete with that band's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, helped matters considerably, since it gave an audience unfamiliar with rap an entry point, but if it was just a novelty record, a one-shot fusion of rap and rock, Raising Hell would never have sold three million copies. No, the music was fully realized and thoroughly invigorating, rocking harder and better than any of its rock or rap peers in 1986, and years later, The remastering of the Raising Hell album was overseen by Rick Rubin.  Rick played a very large role in the early days of Def Jam and went on to have huge success in the rock world producing a lot of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers greatest hits.  The Raising Hell  reissue comes in a soft digipak as all of the other reissues do.  The cover art is the same as the original album.  Run-Dmc were hip-hop legends by the time Raising Hell was released.  The had kicked the door open for rap music being played on the radio. Raising Hell includes the classic tracks ""It's Tricky,"" ""My Adidas"" and ""You Be Illin'"" but it was one track on this album that sent Run-DMC into the stratosphere of mainstream cross-over top 40 music.  ""Walk This Way,"" Run-DMC's ""duet"" or mash-up with Aerosmith was a huge hit for the group in 1986 and it's still probably one of their most recognized songs.  The bonus tracks on the reissue include ""My Adidas"" A Capella, ""Walk This Way"" (demo), Lords of Lyrics (demo), Raising Hell Radio Tour Spot and Live At The Apolla Raw Vocal Commercial.  The set also includes a very impressive color booklet with a really cool album bio and quotes from Rick Rubin, Kid Rock, Ice-T, and Eminem. This album is definately a ""5"".  There is really not much more that I need to say.  If you've never owned it or heard it, you are truly missing out on a piece of history. Arguably one of the most important Rap acts to ever grace a Mic, Run DMC where largely credited with taking rap music, which at that point, was largely considered the domain of the streets and small clubs, and managing to cross over to the mainstream.  This, their third (and unarguably most important) album, was the moment when the trio, found themselves at the forefront of the MTV generation.  And although 2002's ""Greatest Hits"" album cherry picks the biggest moments in their career (i.e. The most popular Singles) this album is probably a better overview of the immortal Run Dmc's output.  If any of their albums could be stood up as their greatest achievement with the late `Jam Master Jay', and Cement, Run Dmc's Place, in rap history as Hip-Hop's ambassadors....then this is it!!  With the tongue twisting raps of ""Peter Pier"", with it's energetic bravado and uncompromising swagger, this was a exactly the sort of track that endeared them to both underground rap fans, and the chart buying public.  As the first track on this album beautifully leading straight into the superlative ""It's Tricky"", with it's stuttering bass/beats and playful rhymes, not to mention a superbly playful video to accompany the single release.  Run Dmc began the gradual crossover appeal of Hip-Hop.  But to purely mention just Run Dmc in this review would be unfair, not to mention a unsung pivotal figure in their success....the production genius of ""Rick Rubin"" that toughened their sound, and give the rudimentary production of their first two albums, a more polished and accessible edge.  And nowhere is this better exemplified then, when the phenomenal Aerosmith/Run Dmc pairing ""Walk This Way"" rolls into view, it skilfully mixed rock dynamics, with the cool loops and beats of Hip-Hop, and although it's now been played to the point of over-familiarity, there can be no arguments as to how influential it was, in taking Hip-Hop/Rap from the underground and to a much wider audience.  As a group, Run Dmc where always smart then the average rap act, firstly by affiliating themselves with the `Adidas' shoe company  (Hence the ""My Adidas"" track).  Their sound has always been one of Confident street smart and the Brash (""Dumb Girl""), and more importantly by being louder and more invigorating then their rivals, but in such a way as to not scare of potential new listeners.  Compared to the sort of lyrical delivery of more contemporary acts (Nas, Jay-Z, Gza), or the leap and strides made in Production (Madlib, Kayne West, Dj Premier), this album can sound a little dated on occasion.  but this album was (and still is) Run Dmc's Crowning Glory and Paved the way, for future acts, and it's importance in Hip-Hop simply cannot be underestimated. An inarguable rap classic, although I prefer the debut. It's still packed with incredible tunes, though. The first four songs are some of the best of early hip-hop: the brilliant Jam Master Jay showpiece ""Peter Piper,"" ""It's Tricky,"" a fantastic example of the group's ""rap with heavy guitars"" thing; ""My Adidas,"" a shoe commercial that's nonetheless incredibly funky and loads better than the similar designer commercials that pass for rap hits these days (you know, that stupid ""apple bottom jeans, boots with the fur"" song? The one that really blows? Whoever it's by, they're not very good), and the rap-rock breakthrough ""Walk This Way."" That's my pick for the best rap tune ever, by the way. Note how, rather than simply sampling the main riff and the chorus and adding a rap over it, as most of today's rappers would do, they actually collaborate with Joe Perry and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, and they have Joe Perry play the actual riff of the actual song, and add a really cool guitar solo. And it was a great choice for a rap group to cover, because Tyler was pretty much rapping the song in the original version, and it's a good song to begin with no matter which version you're talking about. Even the more clich&eacute;d boasting tracks are good: ""Is it Live"" has great turntable rock; ""Perfection"" has a solid beat. Okay, so ""Hit it Run"" isn't too interesting, but it's made up by the riff monster title track, ""You be Illin',"" a funny song with nice horn blasts and a good bass line; and the social comment ""Proud to be Black."" Despite a few songs that overuse annoying gimmicks (""Dumb Girl""), this is still an excellent release. Normally, I'm more of a rock fan but in my spare time I listened to Beastie Boys, and that was usually as far as it went until one day I heard the song &quot;Peter Piper&quot; and thought, wow, Run D.M.C, is awesome. So I heard five more songs and now I own the CD, if you've never heard a Run D.M.C. song, you must hear this first. Drop what you're doing, run to the store, and buy it, it's well worth the money. RIP, Grand Master Jay. The best cd of all time with no doubt.They've reached perfection.True legends 4everRIP Jam Master Jay Before the days of the internet, I had to fly down to New York to pick up the latest 12"" singles.  When the Peter Piper/My Adidas single was released, it was blowing up parties everywhere, and I can remember the anticipation waiting for the new album.  By chance I was in NYC the day that Raising Hell was released, and I remember seeing it/hearing it in a record store in Manhattan, and I just flipped.  Everything about it was awesome.  Finally a rap group that was doing it big!!!  Raising Hell was so different, so tight, and it had such a live feel to it!!!It was comparable to when the first Run DMC album came out, and me and the crew were like ""What the heck is that?""  If the first album said ""New school is here,"" this album said ""we're staying!!!""Definitely an album that no hip hopper should be without.  I'm finally buying the CD because all my vinyl copies have finally worn out, and this copy is for the archives. People who praise folks like Limp Bizkit as being innovative just aren't hip to the fact that RUN DMC mixed rap and rock music a long time ago, even as far back as their first album.  The monster cut on here that proves that is &quot;Walk This Way&quot; done with Aerosmith.  This album also boasts four other songs that got major airplay -- &quot;You Be Illin'&quot;, &quot;Peter Piper&quot;, &quot;My Adidas&quot; (a shout out to the shoe manufacturer who's products they endorsed heavily), and &quot;It's Tricky&quot;. This album is the sole reason why my station name is hiphopforlife.I make it a point to listen to this album everyday. The essence of old school hip hop coming from the &quot;second generation hip hoppers&quot;.No Limp Bizkit,Korn,Linkin Park,or any nu-metal band without Run,DMC or Jam Master Jay. Where can I get the single Walk This Way? With Run DMC And Aerosmith Most of the rap and hip hop today is filled with vile, degrading lyrics and repetitive, unimaginative synthesized music. This album has to be in the top 5 best every in its genre. I liked it a lot when it first came out in the mid 80's and I like it even more today! &quot;Raising Hell&quot; is definately the best album from Run-D.M.C. and arguably one of the greatest rap albums ever produced.  This is a must have for any true fan of rap music. This album is one of the finest moments in Hip-Hop history, and in music history indeed. It has influenced a great array of bands from USA to Spain. Fabulous track list: Walk this way, My Adidas, and many others. Just for Walk this way this album worths the price. It is a must for any modern music lover. Why did I wait so long to have it?. When &quot;Raising Hell&quot; was released in 1986, it literally took rap music from being an underground phenomenon to setting it on the course for mainstream success and acceptance. The first rap album to go  multi-platinum, top ten on the pop chart, and helped pave the way for the  Beastie Boys huge success with &quot;Licensed To Ill&quot; which was  released just three months after this album(and Run and D co-wrote  &quot;Paul Revere&quot; and &quot;Slow and Low&quot;). Most importantly,  there are the songs. &quot;Peter Piper&quot;, &quot;My Addias&quot;,  &quot;You Be Illin'&quot;,and &quot;Walk This Way&quot; which was  responsible for helping revive Aerosmith's flagging career. This reissue  also sounds much better than the original CD pressing. You can't call  yourself a real hip-hop fan if you don't own this album. One of the very  best of the genre. Straight off, there are 3 killer tracks here 'It's tricky', Walk this way, and You be illin. The original version of it's tricky (which is found here) is heaps better than the version released in 1998. The only other song that comes close to the above mentioned is 'Dumb Girl' which is catchy. But the fierce beats on this CD make up for the rest of the tracks. Check out RUN DMC to hear the original masters of rap/metal, the only other band that can match them in rap/metal is Rage Against the Machine. By the time I was 11 years old, I had heard several RUN-DMC songs:  ""Sucker MCs"", ""Hard Times"", ""It's Like That"", ""Rock Box"", ""King Of Rock"", ""You Talk Too Much"" and ""Can You Rock It Like This"", but I had never thought to ask for some money to buy a RUN DMC tape because I knew I had to pick and choose wisely what tapes I wanted from my folks.  However, once I heard ""Peter Piper"" and ""My Adidas"" blaring out of one of my friend's boombox, I knew that I had to pick up ""Raising Hell"".  I still remember the look that my aunt had when she looked at the title.  This is definitely in my Top 25 of all rap releases of all time.  The whole tape stayed in heavy rotation, along with the Beastie Boys' ""Licensed To Ill"" for a long time.  ""Peter Piper"" was a way for DJ Run and DMC to pay homage to their one man band, Jam Master Jay.  After Grandmaster Flash, Jam Master Jay was the first DJ who did it all.  He played percussion, drums and several other instruments and he provided the infamous scratches that you always heard in all of RUN-DMC's songs.  ""Walk This Way"", a remake to the rock group, Aerosmith's song, became the smash hit from this CD. Even MTV had to make sure this video was in heavy rotation.  ""Raising Hell"" became the first platinum album from any rap group.  ""My Adidas"" made everyone, no matter what race or age, want a pair of Adidas or some sort of Adidas apparel.  ""Is It Live"" used a nice DC go go beat and Run and DMC flowed something lovely on the song.  ""Perfection"" used a drum beat that was one of my favoites back in the day.  ""You Be Illin'"" was a very comical track.  Even when I hear the song to this day, I can't help from laughing.  Run was beat boxing like Buffy from the Fat Boys on ""Hit It Run"" and DMC had no problem handling the lyrics by himself.  ""Proud To Be Black"" was the change of pace song on the CD and you had to actually listen to the lyrics and understand what message they were trying to get across.  Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin handled the production but Run and Jam Master Jay co-produced most of the songs, so they had input in the production process as well.  Overall when you look at Run-DMC's library of CDs, ""Raising Hell"" is their best CD, in my opinion.  However, more important than their legacy in hip hop, the hip hop world has lost an icon in hip hop music.  Jam Master Jay paved the way for DJs all over this world and along with Run and DMC, he helped hip hop crossover into the mainstream audience.  Without Run-DMC there would not be any of the popular rappers that many fans enjoy today.  Jam Master Jay has left his mark on the hip hop industry forever and he will be missed.  RIP and my prayers go out to his family and friends. First off, all the DJ's need to get like 8 copies of this record because beat juggling this & the singles are always fresh. I myself, have an ill routine/juggle with Peter Piper (such a great song) Look...you won't have to skip any of the tracks because the LP is perfect. I just bought this album today, and it is definatly one of the best albums in hip-hop history. They are truly one of the best groups in hip-hop history, but i never thought they were this good. I don't even have to skip a single song, and what impresses me the most is they don't have to cuss in every verse 20 times. They have nice beats and they mix it all in with a little rock too. The remake of Walk This Way is just awesome, and i really can't say what my favorites are, because I like them all. Run-DMC really paved the way for rappers today, and really left a mark on hip-hop history. R.I.P. Jam Master Jay. Like most white kids, my introduction to rap came via Run D.M.C. and their big radio hit, ""Walk This Way"". After 3 months of really wanting ""Raising Hell"", I had enough money to buy the cassette for $6.99 at the now defunct mall music store Discount Records. At the time, I was 13 years old and in 8th grade. Of course my very conservative parents hated them, my father for racist reasons and my mother for music reasons. He liked country and she liked easy listening.Hearing the album today, memories come flooding back. Just like 501s, this is what the cool kids had. Most importantly, I discovered just how FUN and NERDY these guys are. Anybody into current rap and hip-hop should give this a spin and see how it's done old school! The album that brought the joy of rap to thousnads of white children around the world. 13 years after its relase it still holds its own. Perhaps the greatest rap album ever recorded. Raising Hell propelled the pioneering trio to icon status, as Run, DMC and Jam Master Jay became the first ever hip-hop group to attain platinum sales and be embraced by MTV.Everyone knows that the classic cuts such as It's Tricky, Peter Piper and My Adidas are what hip-hop classics are made of. You Be Illin' still remains to be a hilarious track (Run DMC's mentally challenged character orders a Big Mac at a Kentucky Fried Chicken), and the heavy 808 bass on Dumb Girl can still bust the tweeters of any sound system.The trump card/main attraction was definitely Walk this Way, their groundbreaking cover and collaboration with a washed up Aerosmith. Every rap-inspired rocker from Kid Rock to Linkin Park to Fred Durst should bow down on their knees and thank the Almighty that underrated producer Rick Rubin and the classic hardcore hip-hop group re-recorded a dusty breakbeat favorite.Personal favorite= Walk this WayHonorable mentions= Peter Piper, My Adidas and You Be Illin' Raising Hell is RunDMC at their best. Its one of those classic albums that will sell way beyond their time like Dr. Dre's Chronic and Bob Marley's Legend. No joke! All songs come together to make an unforgetable impact on the rap genre. Just look at the song list and see at least half the album are hits. Even the songs that dont look familiar to you are decent at worst. I may be biased when it comes to old school because thats where im from, but beleive me when you r3ad this. This album is definetely an Essential to anyone who takes music seriously. This, I am proud to say, was the first cassette tape I ever owned.  The amazing thing is, 15 years later, Raising Hell still sounds great.  It doesn't sound dated in the least, probably due in part to the fact that current artists (the Beastie Boys in particular) still borrow liberally from Run-DMC.  If you haven't heard it, you'll be surprised at how familiar Raising Hell sounds.  An essential album for anyone who likes anything with a beat. 2 that person called darkfather and his one star rating of Raising Hell, Huh? Run-DMC vs. 50-Cent or 2-Pac? Don't make me laugh!!! No contest!!! I'll take The Kingz of Rock over 2 Quarters any day!!! They laid the ground work for future hip-hoppers, and unfortunately, other than PE, LL, and NWA, maybe Biggie, there hasn't been many able to truly measure up or carry the torch the way the Adidas Boyz did. Run-D.M.C. and their Raising Hell album is still in my opinion the single greatest reason why there is a rap genre today. Your rating and comments suggest that you are not a real fan and student of true hip-hop and its' humble beginnings. Never has there been a group that has made me think &quot;damn these guys are good&quot; more than Run D.M.C. Raising hell is the peak of their career. This album was a true groundbreaker in hip hop, I keep asking my self &quot;where would we be without &quot;Raising Hell&quot;?My favorite track is Walk this way with Steven Tyler of the vocals. A definite staple in any rock or hip hop fans collection, get it now! This album along with Beastie Boys - Licensed To Ill defined so much of my childhood and musical tastes.  It takes me back to a time when hip hop was young and it was more about the music and less about the money & bling.  Sure people still rapped about having several fancy cars, nice clothes and money but it was done in a way that wasn't excessive or obnoxious.  For example, I saw Young Jeezy's ""All White Everything"" video the other night and it disgusted me to see that rap continues to degrade into such a pitiful state.  That's why it's good to look back on when hip hop was young and actually meant something more than material things.  Not to mention the talent was there where it clearly is lacking with many of today's artists.  Here are my track ratings for this iconic album by RUN D.M.C.;1. Peter Piper  8/102. Its Tricky  10/10 (This song constantly gets stuck in my head, I love it!)3. My Adidas  10/10 (Classic and probably why I still love adidas so much today)4. Walk This Way  10/10 (How can you not like this song?)5. Is It Live  8/106. Perfection  6/107. Hit It Run  10/10 (Brilliant)8. Raising Hell  8/109. You Be Illin  8/1010. Dumb Girl  6/1011. Son Of Byford  7/1012. Proud To Be Black  7/10While not every song on this album is a hit, the album as a whole is absolutely phenomenal.  Add in the fact that many of the songs have positive messages regarding issues such as race and anti-drug use.  Something you never seen in modern rap since it wouldn't be seen as ""credible.""  Sad really.  In any case, a brilliant album that defined an entire genre and will never to be forgotten. This is a great cd from RUN-DMC that really gives you a good sample of what these guys were capable of doing. It has some of the best lines when rapping was clever and funny, not like today. This is something to play and help ease away the tensions of sitting in rush hour traffic, just be prepared to get loud! If your looking for a good rap cd that will take you back to the amazing 80's you found it. Run-DMC's third album, 1986's Raising Hell is not the best or most influential album in hip hop history, but it is the most important.  Up until then, hip hop was thought of a fringe genre popular in urban areas but not accessible to the rest of the country.  Raising Hell broke that stereotype by crashing into the Billboard 200 top ten peaking at number 3 and going triple platinum becoming the first hip hop album to crossover and make the top ten.  The group savily released as the first single a cover of Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way"" (featuring Steven Tyler & Joe Perry) which was a smash hit and also became the first hip hop song to make the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at number 4 (the song also reignited Aerosmith's career which was dead at the time).  One of the weakest songs on the album is actually ""Walk This Way"". ""It's Tricky"", ""You Be Illin'"", ""Peter Piper"", ""My Adidas"" and the title track are all much better examples of the group's rap skills and DJ ability. This is a great album.  As I played the the first song, I was dancing and jumping around.  If you like rap music I would buy this album. I would consider Run Dmc to be one of the pioneers of rap music. They delivered the goods with this album.  Good party record. In the middle of the 80's, when we went from old school to new school, Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay were the kings of the hill. Breakbeats got exchanged with drum machines, and the trio put the skills in focus. ""Two turntables and a mic"" as we say it.That was all you needed, and the interaction between MC Run and Darryl Mack really shock people. Now it wasn't just important what you said, but how you said it.Even though Run-DMC and King Of Rock also did well, with respectively gold- and platinum selling, it was Raising Hell that was the real breakthrough for the Queens-trio. The record sold more than three million copies, and seriously put hip-hop on the map. Run-DMC were known for being the first to merge rap and rock (""Rock Box"" from 1984) and their collaboration with Aerosmith, ""Walk This Way"", which became a huge crossover hit. Others songs, for example the DJ-favorite ""Peter Piper"", ""It's Tricky"", ""My Adidas"" and ""You Be Illin'"", are all looked upon as classics today.In my opinion Raising Hell are their finest moment. The debutalbum, Run-DMC are also classic material, but Raising Hell was more universality and entertaining. They were grown up, and talked about more than just sucker mc's. I remember this record was in heavy rotation home in my room, and I also remembering I tried to learn the lyrics by memory.One of my personal favorites was actually the acapella track ""Son Of Byford"". If you wanna learn more about the roots of hip-hop, this is the essential buy. These three are real pioneers, and Raising Hell are nothing less than a milestone in the music industry. Recognize! I'm a huge old school rap fan and this is the blueprint on how it's supposed to be done. I was in 8th grade when this came out and it just added to my already legendary flow. I would recite ""Son of Byford"" while walking down the hall with a smoking hot philly on each arm. I was wearing generra shirts, polo shirts, coca-cola shirts and Diet Pepsi jeans. My hair was parted perfectly on the right side to the point that women just wanted to touch it. This CD is flawless all the way through and inspired me to start the hottest new rap group in Millard at the time. Run B.R.A.(Burns, Rich, Abs) was just off the hook and hit home with the under 15 set. We had hit after hit with songs like, ""I can't wait until I'm 16"", ""Hooking up at the roller rink"" and ""Grab my butt you crazy woman!!"". These standards were requested time after time at birthday parties. We would play retirement homes, Copier repair shops and the Sapp Brothers Ballroom. It was always standing room only and many fights broke out over which one of us was the hottest. We were all extremely smooth, but when I laid the smooth as yogurt voice out there, the ladies were throwing undergarments at me. By saying that, I'm not implying that Burns and Jabs were not smooth as well, they hooked up after every show too and are still smoother than you, the reader, could ever dream of being. To sum this up, your chances of being like us are minimal, but you can buy this CD to make yourself feel a little like us. I have always loved the 80s Rap/Hip Hop bands/groups.  This was one of their best albums ever.  It is a must have. This cd came out during the golden age of hip-hop 1986. This was a time when Eric B &amp; Rakim, Kool G Rap, Bizmarkie, Shante, MC Shan, LL Cool J and a few other notables were in control of the hip-hop market. When this cd dropped it stood out above the rest as the best. Incredible production and slammin lyrics are the reasons why this is the best. It took hip-hop mainstream and gave it substance and balance and also respect from the critics. Nuff respect to the &quot;KINGS OF RAP&quot;.... That's the only words I can use to describe it. This album is a classic masterpiece. Everyone knows that this is a classic!  What amazes me is that this album is two years before Public Enemy's It Takes A Nations Of Millions To Hold Us Back and BDP's By All Means Necessary.  It almost seems like their first two albums were just practice.  This album changed everything.  Everyone loves Walk This Way but I prefer Is It Live? Definitely, one of the innovative hip hop albums, this is what Nelly and his St. Lunies must have heard the day or night before they wrote Air Force 1s.  Or what Black Robb listened to before he wrote WHOA.  Just check out My Adidas and You Be Illin'.  Many other great songs appear as well, like the highly sampled, forever loved, and respected Peter Piper...Just get it and enjoy the great music, nuff said... Everybody in the mainstream rap world these days is so obsessed with thug culture and trying to manufacture some ridiculous ""gangsta"" image. Which is a shame, because rap and hip-hop were a helluva lot more fun when rappers weren't afraid to smile.Run-DMC's Raising Hell and Beastie Boys' Licence To Ill, both released in 1986, are testaments to this loose, wild, and occassionally goofy era. Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay (R.I.P.) craft lots of great tracks with creative samples and beats, layered vocals, and lyricism that is both tight and laugh-out loud funny. A lot of the samples are of big guitars, emphasizing the crossover of rock and rap prevalent at the time. Witness Run-DMC's cover of Walk This Way, featuring the participation of Steve Tyler and Joe Perry and a big hit in the pallid hair metal-dominated landscape of 1987.Most every track is solid, and there is a share of all-time classics on here--You Be Illin', It's Tricky, the title cut, and of course the immortal Peter Piper (which has been sampled by other acts from here to infinity). The line ""Turntables wobble, but they don't fall down!"" on its own is worth buying the album for. My Adidas pretty much started the rap trend of product endorsement, which is unfortunate because the track is pretty good. The closer Proud To Be Black is a humourous take on what would later become the ethos of afrocentric groups like Public Enemy.In summary, Raising Hell proved that at the time Run-DMC were ""The Kings Of Rock,"" and should not be missed by anyone, even listeners who generally avoid the rap genre. If you dig it, I also recommend the Beastie Boys' first two albums. Working with producer Rick Ruben, the Queens crew made an undeniable album that forced the mainstream to cross over to hip-hop. Run and DMC talked trash over Jam Master Jay's killer mixology, and they bum-rushed MTV with a vandalistic cover of Aerosmith's &#34;Walk This Way&#34; featuring Steven Tyler and Joe Perry. very simply put RUN DMC are the freshest and Illest ever, they are the kings of Rock there is none higher. I was just a kid when this came out in 1986. I was strictly a metal head  back then. Run DMC made rap fun to listen to for sure.  It opened doors to  a wide variety of music I listen to now.  Thanks guys!  This cd is an  historic artifact now, may it never be forgotten. Peace Pure brilliance. It's beautiful. I'd type a longer review but I have to BE places now... I big THANK YOU should go out to RUN-DMC for putting hip-hop on the map. I understand that there were others in the industry that came before RUN-DMC (ex. SugarHill Gang) yet: I believe that Run-Dmc wanted to try to reach thier music to a much broader audience, and doing a cover of Walk this Way was a brillent way to reach fans of rock music. Not only did they cover this, they had Aerosmith play along with them. In todays music, this is all so common. Most aren't suprised with Duets and Guest appearences on albums, such as Country going with Hip-Hop or Metal going with Classical. But for 1986, this was a big deal. I only know of one odder pairing and that would be Bing Crosby and David Bowie for their Duet on ""The little Drummer Boy"" Funny thing about RUN-DMC was that not only did fans love ""Walk this Way"" but realized that the rest of the album kicked some a** 2! This was the birth of Hip-Hop from out of the streets and into the suburbs. Over the next few years we would see the industry take storm, as hip-hop began gettting airplay, and its own radio stations, not just some late night shows on college radio stations. Then ganster rap evolved (thank NWA) and the rest is history. WE must thank Run-DMC for this, for who knows where hip-hop would be without them..ENJOY 1986 - Raising Hell. What! Too many joints to name. The whole thing is part of this hiphop thing blueprint. Run, D, and Jay were superstars and the undisputed Kings of Rap. Walk this way was they entry to mainstream, but in the hood we were blasting My Adidas, It's Tricky, Hit it Run and You be Illin. Classic Groundbreaking Material. Nuff Said! This album is the third multi-platinum release by the Krush Groovers from Hollis, Queens.  The album transcends rap music and culture to a true art form.  Aerosmith contibutes backround vocals and music for a stunning  remake of Walk This Way.  Other notable songs include My Adidas, which  helped them develop their own line of shoes, It's Tricky, with Penn and  Teller in that video, and You Be Illin', which was played in the feature  film Half Baked.  This release should appeal to people that normally don't  listen to rap because of the rock fusion on some of the songs.  Just  looking at the cover reminds me of the mid 1980's and the evolvement of rap  as a marketing force to be reckoned with in Billboard magazine. Run-DMC did it again with the release of their third album, Raising Hell. If their first two albums didn't put them on the map, then this one CERTAINLY did. It set all kinds of historical precedence for hip hop(and music in general), the likes of which will NEVER be matched again. Run, DMC, and Jam Master Jay returned with gusto with this album, proving to everyone that their success was no fluke, and it WASN'T. Here's the review:Album Highlights; Peter Piper, Walk This Way, Dumb Girl, It's Tricky, and My Adidas.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: Another landmark in hip hop. Run-DMC forever made their mark in the world of music with this AWESOME album. If you don't own this album now, you're truly missing out on something classic and special. Strongly recommended. By their third album, Run-D.M.C. were primed for a breakthrough into the mainstream, but nobody was prepared for a blockbuster on the level of Raising Hell. Run-D.M.C. and King of Rock had established the crew's fusion of hip-hop and hard rock, but that sound didn't blossom until Raising Hell, partially due to the presence of Rick Rubin as producer. Rubin loved metal and rap in equal measures and he knew how to play to the strengths of both, while slipping in commercial concessions that seemed sly even when they borrowed from songs as familiar as &quot;My Sharona&quot; (heard on &quot;It's Tricky&quot;). Along with longtime Run-D.M.C. producer Russell Simmons, Rubin blew down the doors of what hip-hop could do with Raising Hell because it reached beyond rap-rock and found all sorts of sounds outside of it. Sonically, there is simply more going on in this album than any previous rap record -- more hooks, more drum loops (courtesy of ace drum programmer Sam Sever), more scratching, more riffs, more of everything. Where other rap records, including Run-D.M.C.'s, were all about the rhythm, this is layered with sounds and ideas, giving the music a tangible flow. But the brilliance of this record is that even with this increased musical depth, it still rocks as hard as hell, and in a manner that brought in a new audience. Of course, the cover of Aerosmith's &quot;Walk This Way,&quot; complete with that band's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, helped matters considerably, since it gave an audience unfamiliar with rap an entry point, but if it was just a novelty record, a one-shot fusion of rap and rock, Raising Hell would never have sold three million copies. No, the music was fully realized and thoroughly invigorating, rocking harder and better than any of its rock or rap peers in 1986, and years later, that sense of excitement is still palpable on this towering success story for rap in general and Run-D.M.C. in specific. And another huge step beyond their previous album.  This would soon become the blueprint for all rap albums made after it.  If you're a rap fan and don't own this album, you're just fronting. This is by far one of their best albums. Back in 1986 when it came out, the rap scene was being molded by people like L.L. Cool J, Beastie Boys, Doug E. Fresh, and the Duo known as RUN DMC. RUN DMC was cutting edge with riffs of rock and roll intertwined with raw beats and mean scratching. It began the days of catchy hooks with bells and screaming guitars masterly overlaid with hard core rhymes. Shell toe adidas, three stripe jogging suits, and cardboard boxes cut out for breakdancing mats were the premiss behind the sounds coming from large ghetto blasters, with the voices of Jam Master Jay, Darryl ""DMC"" McDaniels and Joe ""Run"" Simmons ringing out over the tight fresh beats. True pioneers to what hip hop has become today.","Old School,Pop Rap,Soul,Pop,East Coast,R&B,Rap & Hip-Hop,Gangsta & Hardcore,Blues",run dmc arguably influential group rap raising hell made famous back singles oriented classics like peter piper timeless tricky time set trends hip hop footwear adidas helped rap crossover mainstream walk way rap ified remake aerosmith classic emcees run dmc capable delivering meaningful lyrics like socially conscious proud black time show know fun rock party like hit run illin run dmc also gave birth tag team rhyming used great rap groups beastie boys outkast jam master jay genius right using fair number samples perfection mention sick turntable skills since singles oriented filler isnt great thats loses star filler isnt exa run run dmc arguably influential group rap raising raising hell hell famous singles oriented classics peter piper piper timeless tricky time set trends hip hip hop hop footwear adidas helped rap crossover mainstream walk walk way way rap remake aerosmith classic emcees run capable delivering meaningful lyrics socially conscious proud black time show know fun rock party hit run run run dmc gave birth birth tag tag team team rhyming used great rap rap groups groups beastie boys boys jam jam master jay master jay genius right fair number samples perfection mention sick turntable skills singles oriented filler isnt great loses star star filler filler isnt exa

Eg. the first and third part of trip II the moon are not on this disc as well as some cool mixes of other tracks. Acen was one of the few artists that managed a full cd-release - most others could only dream of that. but afterwards he disappeared. he is merely active doin some drum and bass productions now - but to be true - listening to the new stuff this is something completely different which I dont like much.and so the world turned away from that beautiful breakbeat-style (which is THAT fast and furious, only prodigys ""experience"" album was able to follow) and ACEN turned away as well from it. people started to listen to happy hardcore which was not really a progress in development, and few fans were seraching for anyone out there beeing able to fill the ""gap"" acen left by ending up his breakbeat carreer. but noone could. i guess even noone tried. cause it was clear for all of us taht imitation of this unique sound was impossibble. and that is what acen made that great, and for me a lifetime-memory. even if this sound slowly turns into an oldie-status i will always feel 18 again while listening - and my feet will do so as well. also check some baby d stuff. eg. the remixes - on one disc u can find ""acen in wonderland"" and as well the remix of ""so pure"" is quite close to the earlier and brilliant acen stuff.if u have any chance buyin that cd or any other acen related material get it!!!!!!!!!!!! i leave this message as a tribute to acen who made my life much more brighter. and for those who feel the same as me and were sad that acen did not follow with some more breath-taking sound. cause as he said: THIS IS NOT MUSIC - by far it isnt - its much, much more.  :0)tom from germany Living in the midwest of USA I have few friends into techno , and none that are as much as I am.  Alot of them tell me that 75 is chessy and corny but the sped up vocals and all the synths and ecstatic beats are actually  quite epic.  You can dance to all of the songs but they all evoke emotions  too.  This is some of the best techno ever made and I wish all of Acen's  stuff was still printed, so get this while it still is.

404,788,B000000CS8,"Pls advise if Debbie Boone's earlier albums:  Soundtrack You light up my life, Another goodbye, etc will be remastered and released on CDs?  Have been waiting for this to happen for a long long time.  I am sure there will be a lot of interest especially in the soundtrack of you light up my life.  Pls help. Debby Boone, before she started singing Contemporary Christian Music was one of the biggest selling pop vocalists of the 1970's with the success of &quot;You Light Up My Life,&quot; which peaked at #1 on the pop and adult contemporary charts and #4 on the country charts in 1977 selling over 1 million copies and is really a cover of the theme to a movie of the same name that flopped.  (If the movie were a blockbuster success, they would have promoted the version that was played in the movie, but fortunately, Debby recorded it at the right time and they promoted it, etc.).  Since &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; was a hit, she only had moderate success on the Adult Contemporary and country charts with songs such as &quot;God Knows,&quot; a cover of Barbara Lewis's &quot;Baby I'm Yours,&quot; a cover of Connie Francis's &quot;My Heart Has a Mind of It's Own, &quot;Free To Be Lonely Again,&quot; &quot;Perfect Fool,&quot; and others.  The country styled &quot;Are You On The Road To Lovin' Me Again&quot; peaked at #1 on the country charts.  Most of her hits that charted on all of the Billboard charts are on this budget compilation from Curb compiled in 1986 (this was digitally remastered in 1990), in excellent sound, despite the cheesy artwork, and or everyone but diehard fans, this is all you really need of her work although a cover of Connie Francis's &quot;Breakin' In a Brand New Broken Heart&quot; which peaked in the top 30 of the country charts is missing. ...after all, this compilation includes one of the all-time hits (you know which one I'm talking about). My favorite on this album, and it was a nice find, was the best rendition of &#34;I'll Never Say Goodbye (The Promise)&#34; that I have heard.I deducted one star because of grammar! The song labeled &#34;My Heart Has A Mind Of It's Own&#34; should have read &#34;its&#34; withOUT an apostrophe. What has happened to copy editors????? Debby Boone has a great voice and it was really good to hear some of these old songs again.  The main reason that I bought this cd was for the song ""You light up my life"".  No one sings that song like Debby.  The rest of the cd is very good too though. Enough said; just what I bought it for.  Just what the  doctor order for her joy and happiness into her world.:-) When my wonerful, but deceasd wife and i were selecting our wedding rings, she insisted that the tiele of the song &#34;You Light up My Life&#34; be engraved in my ring.  that dong was the basis for a wonderful 27 years of marriage and Debbie Boone does it so well.  I have listened to it (and still o) hndreds of times.  Her dditional renerings are also great.  Debbie has that sweet emlodic voice that us olsters remember and loved. This CD was recorded when Debby was much younger.  Her voice is young and fresh and full of life and much different from the present day.  Her voice has much more life than her later performances.  If you listen to the CD several times, the music will get easily stuck with you.  It will continue to play in your mind. when i met my wife pam,i began using the hit,you light up my life, for my wife pam.  i got my wife through amild case of anorexia nervosa,switching degrees at purdue, raising a colic child when i worked in extension.  she is a famous elite wife at my us news top 20 purdue,glory bound,regional 2 at western kentucky,dreamy eyes pam, us news 3 at u of l,nice to be with you. A true talent that plays on and will always please the listener. If you think you might be interested in this cd then you will not be disappointed. This singer has so many more recordings that are worth MORE than a listen. The Warner Brothers clearly didn't know a sister when they saw it. This best of collection shows this  artist in a varying array of styles  that showcase heartfelt vocals  throughout.  Nashville shone via this artist  before it was &quot;cool to do country&quot;.  The release also showcases Boones'  pop vocal belting which has earned  her a few grammys and numerous other  awards and nominations. Although the  release pretty much ignores her  gospel roots, it shows a gifted  interpreter who regardless of the  &quot;one hit wonder &quot; tag peirces  through that tag with a voice of  sheer power and joy. Debby Boone is a great one to sing these songs of her mother-in-law, Rosemary Clooney. Here we have the talants of two professional singers on one Compact Disc. I own most of the recordings of Rosemary Clooney. She was one great lady when it came to performing by singing or in films. She will be missed by many since she passed away. I am one of these wno miss her, because I looked forward to each of her new releases. A superb performance. The daughter of pop singer Pat Boone and maternal granddaughter of country singer Red Foley, Debby proves on this collection that she has absorbed all those musical influences.This collection covers the period 1977 to 1980, during which time Debby had enormous success in America. You light up my life spent many weeks at number one in the American pop charts and also made the top five in the country charts, though it barely made the top fifty in Britain. Unfortunately, Debby was unable to find a follow-up pop hit, but eventually had a number one country hit with Are you on the road to loving me again.Both those songs are here, along with two Connie Francis covers (My heart has a mind of its own, Everybody's somebody's fool) and a Barbara Lewis cover (Baby I'm yours). There are two songs here by the brilliant but obscure Diane Pfeifer (Free to be lonely again, Perfect fool) who, as far as I know, recorded one album of her own around that time then disappeared back to obscurity. Two excellent movie songs - When you're loved (from Magic of Lassie) and The promise (from The promise) - and another fine song (God knows) complete an excellent set.This collection contains all the essentials from a great singer who did the family proud. I have enjoyed the cd very much I looked everywhere for itbecause I needed it for my wedding and was so glad that amazon.com had itit was a song that me and my high school sweetheart love andafter 30 yrs. we met up and have just recently married and thats why Iwanted it to play at our wedding This hits comp doesn't do Debby Boone's career the justice it deserves.  At the moment this is the best introductory package of her secular music career, though it should be upgraded to include all her hits.  Additionally, someone like Collectors Choice should put a 2-Lp comp of her YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE and MIDSTREAM albums on the burner for a 2-fer reissue.Here's all her singles; only several of them appear on this short (only ten songs) hits comp--Debby Boone Warner Bros. 45 singles (1977-1981):Warner Bros.8446  You Light Up My Life/He's a Rebel  (August, 1977)8455  You Light Up My Life/Hasta Manana8511  California/Hey Everybody8554  God Knows/Baby I'm Yours8633  When You're Loved/Oh No Not My Baby8700  In Memory of Your Love/When You're Loved8739  My Heart Has A Mind of Its Own/I'd Rather Leave While I'm In Love8814  Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart/When You're Loved  (May, 1979)49042  See You In September/Jamie49107  Everybody's Somebody's Fool/I'll Never Say Goodbye49176  Are You On The Road to Lovin' Me Again/When It's Just You and Me49281  Free To Be Lonely Again/Love Put a song In My Heart49585  Take It Like a Woman/I Wish I Could Hurt That Way Again49652  Perfect Fool/Every Day I Have to Cry49720  I'll Be Him/Too Many Rivers  (June, 1981)As a secular recording artist, Debby Boone was Mike Curb's creation.  Mike Curb came to prominence in the early 1970s updating Nixonian Rock Alternative Music* with his Mike Curb Congregation, initially with the COME TOGETHER album by that group on Co-Burt Records (MGM), and then folding into MGM Records, where he became the label head, and generally gave everyone the impression that the time of Doodletown rock `n' roll's time had come on the record charts when ""Burning Bridges"" went Top-40 in 1971.  Unlike the Doodletown Pipers and the Young Americans, the Mike Curb Congregation got hits on both 45s and Lps, but Curb's Mitch Miller-like business acumen really hit home when he got big RIAA certified gold records with the Osmonds/Donny Osmond/Little Jimmy Osmond/Marie Osmond MGM bubblegum catalog (while his Mike Curb Congregation funky faux-churchy group played out crooning Disney songs in 1973), and he had similar success with pop/country acts like later Debby Boone and the Bellamy Brothers on his Curb Records.*Nixonian Rock Alternative Music:  male/female choral groups singing vanilla pop versions of FOR-YOUTH rock songs, which was a whitebread major label attempt to come up with SOMETHING, ANYTHING to claw back some of the Beatles/British Invasion guitar band rock `n' roll audience.  Groups like the Young Americans, Doodletown Pipers, post-Randy Sparks New Christy Minstrels, New Classic Singers, Up With People, Mike Curb Congregation, the Now Generation, The New Seekers, the Young Generation, Ray Bloch Singers, BYU's Young Ambassadors, the Brigham Young University Singers, etc....  The U.S. forerunner of Menudo:  producer owned groups with disposable singers as employees, recording groups founded on the greaseburger-flipping fast food model.  I attribute the phenomenon to Richard Nixon's endorsement of the Carpenters, c. mid-'73 (and almost killed their career because of it), as ""rock"" music for the Silent Majority folks, though the rise of FOR-YOUTH groups dates from mid-1965-forward, with LOTS of TV exposure that didn't translate into record sales.  The TV Glen Campbell GOODTIME HOUR blasted the Mike Curb Congregation repeatedly on the show, but the MCC hits album, MGM SE 4804, bombed on its December, 1971, release, and the Doodletown Pipers could only get one last gasp on a Bell Records 45 single with the TV exposure at the time.","Christian,Country,Pop,Today's Country,Broadway & Vocalists,Gospel,Vocal Pop",pls advise debbie boones earlier soundtrack light life another goodbye etc remastered released cds waiting happen long long time sure lot interest especially soundtrack light life pls help debby boone started singing contemporary christian one biggest selling pop vocalists success quot light life quot peaked pop adult contemporary charts country charts selling million copies really cover theme movie name flopped movie blockbuster success would promoted version played movie fortunately debby recorded right time promoted etc since quot light life quot hit moderate success adult contemporary country charts quot god knows qu pls advise debbie boones earlier soundtrack light life goodbye remastered released cds waiting happen long long long time time sure lot interest especially soundtrack light life pls help started singing contemporary christian selling pop vocalists success quot light life quot peaked pop adult adult contemporary charts contemporary charts country charts selling copies really cover theme movie flopped movie blockbuster success promoted version played movie fortunately recorded right right time time promoted quot light life quot hit moderate success adult contemporary contemporary country country charts god god knows knows qu
405,790,B000000CSO,"Watching the Lucy show and Here's Lucy listen to him sing on both shows I knew I had to get some of his music Wayne Newtown takes a lot of kidding, but he's actually very talented.  There's a reason why he became the top attraction in Las Vegas, despite only having a few hit songs.  Only four of his songs actually made the pop Top 40: ""Danke Schoen"", ""Red Roses For a Blue Lady"", ""Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast"" and ""Years"".  All those songs are on this CD, although with the exception of ""Years"", they are re-recordings (and ""Years"" is a remixed version of the hit).  The other six songs on this CD are songs that Wayne had never recorded before, as far as I know.  So, this is more or less a regular Wayne Newtown album with four hit songs tossed in.  It's actually a pretty good album.  Wayne is in good voice here, and most of the songs suit his singing style.  Suprisingly, one of Wayne's best performances is on the Cat Stevens song ""Here Comes My Baby"".  Other highlights included the hits (of course) and the new song ""U.S. Male"".  Wayne's fans (you know who you are) should enjoy this CD. The man is Las Vegas. I have loved Wayne's songs since I was a kid. And I am not old I am only 21. I took a friend to see Wayne in concert and brought them around. Listen to this album and if you don't like or know  Wayne you will. Wayne Newton still continues to entertain us after so many years. His contributions to the arts are remarkable; and this album gives us ten musical numbers recorded by Wayne more recently. Listen for a much more mature Wayne Newtown with a lower pitched voice; but his voice remains a fine musical instrument.""You Don't Know What You've Got (Until You Lose It)"" gives us a rock and country flavored ballad with Wayne's vocals in the spotlight. Wayne swings sweet and low to make this number shine; and he never sings a superfluous note. The musical arrangement enhances the number, too. Great start for an album! ""U.S. Male"" sounds like something Elvis might have sang; and Wayne delivers this country flavored ballad like the pro that he is! Moreover, listen for Wayne to deliver his signature song ""Danke Sch&ouml;en"" very, very well. I predict that you will enjoy ""Danke Sch&ouml;en"" very much; and I really like the arrangement for the piano on ""Danke Sch&ouml;en.""""Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast"" sounds terrific; I don't know how else to describe it but Wayne makes ""Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast"" a masterpiece with an incredible delivery of this number.""Here Comes My Baby"" has a great soft rock beat and Wayne sounds great. ""Red Roses For A Blue Lady"" sounds like a symphony as the more mature Wayne delivers this flawlessly. His excellent diction makes ""Red Roses For A Blue Lady"" into a huge highlight of this album.The album ends with a song called ""T-R-O-U-B-L-E;"" Wayne sings this country style ballad with energy and his voice sounds stronger than ever! I love it! The female backup vocalists harmonize well.My only complaint is that we don't get an extra song or two on this CD. Yes, I know--it's inexpensive; but still, come on! Ten songs is short. I will make this a four star review because I am disappointed that they couldn't add at least one more song.Overall, this still remains a great place to start for the casual Wayne Newton fan who wants to know just how beautifully Wayne can sing in our times. Wayne always sang flawlessly; and this album proves he's not losing his stride.Thank you, Wayne! If you've seen Wayne Newton in Las Vegas from the 80's to the present, this CD is for you. The CD includes his hits re-recorded and ""new"" songs. It's a great CD. I recently purchased this cd for one song and that is Daddy Don't you walk so Fast. Don't get me wrong there are other great songs on this cd by Wayne Newton that are just as good as the one I like but my very favorite is Daddy Don't you walk so fast. That was the song I was wanting for my collection. I like Wayne Newton's music. If you like Wayne Newton and a fan of his this cd is a great cd to buy.

406,792,B000000CVA,"What caught my ear and lead me to buy this album was Cowboy's Christmas which is a Christmas Song I had not heard before, awesome a great one to add to the collection. Rest of the songs are just as good, Jingle Bell Rock version is a little different then most and it makes it very enjoyable. A great addition to my collection.1) Winter Wonderland (1:49)2) I'll Be Home For Christmas (3:07)3) White Christmas (4:12)4) Jingle Bell Rock (2:05)5) It's The Season (2:28)6) Blue Snow At Christmas (3:28)7) Silver Bells (3:10)8) Christmas Song (3:34)9) Silent Night (2:52)10) Christmas In The U.S.A. (3:24)11) It Could Have Been A Wonderful Christmas (3:13)12) Jingle Bell Hustle (4:22)13) Cowboy's Christmas (4:01) Growing up my family owned two different Wayne Newton LP albums. One was Wayne's very first album titled Merry Christmas to You and the Second was Merry Christmas from Wayne Newton. I have been looking for alternatives to the costly process of searching out mint condition LPs and having them ripped to CD or MP3.THIS ALBUM IS NOT IT. This album is Older More Swing style Wayne when I am looking for Young crooner style Wayne from the 60's. If you like Wayne's style as he is now this is the album for you. If not keep looking. This was Wayne Newton's second Christmas album.  It was originally released in 1979.  It features mostly older Christmas songs plus a few originals.  The older ones are mostly nothing special, although he does do an exceptional version of ""Silver Bells"".  Another notable ""oldie"" is ""Jingle Bell Hustle"", which is a disco version of ""Jingle Bells"".  This incredibly dated track was actually released as a single, and not surprisingly wasn't a hit.  As for the original songs, they are a mixed bag.  ""It's the Season"" is very good and ""It Could Have Been a Wonderful Christmas"" is above average, but the rest of them aren't that memorable.  This is a definite ""middle of the road"" Christmas album. I am Wayne Newton fan and a collector of Christmas music so when I saw this CD I knew it had a place in my collection.  I wouldn't say that any of the songs will become immortal classics but there are some ""b-grade"" classics which will become favourites for those who don't take their Christmas music too seriously - particularly ""Jingle Bell Hustle"" (yes, it's exactly what the name suggests).  This is a decent album of enjoyable Christmas music. Wayne Newton churns out the old Christmas chestnuts as only he can.  A useful collection for anyone who has not had enough of Winter Wonderland.","Noels,Easy Listening,Vocal Pop,Oldies,Traditional Vocal Pop,Traditional Pop,Pop,Holiday & Wedding,Broadway & Vocalists,Opera & Classical Vocal,Vocal Non-Opera,Christmas",caught ear lead buy cowboys christmas christmas heard awesome great one add collection rest good jingle bell rock version little different makes enjoyable great addition collection winter wonderland ill home christmas white christmas jingle bell rock season blue snow christmas silver bells christmas silent night christmas u could wonderful christmas jingle bell hustle cowboys christmas growing family owned two different wayne newton lp one waynes first titled merry christmas second merry christmas wayne newton looking alternatives costly process searching mint condition lps ripped cd mp older swing style wayne looking young crooner style wayne caught ear lead buy cowboys christmas christmas heard awesome great add collection rest good jingle jingle bell jingle bell rock bell rock version different enjoyable great addition collection winter winter wonderland wonderland ill home christmas white christmas jingle jingle bell jingle bell rock bell rock season blue snow christmas silver silver bells bells silent silent night night christmas wonderful christmas jingle jingle bell bell hustle cowboys christmas growing family family owned different wayne newton newton lp titled merry merry christmas christmas second merry merry christmas christmas wayne newton looking alternatives costly process searching mint mint condition condition lps ripped cd mp older swing swing style style looking young crooner style
407,794,B000000CZ4,"As with every other collection that I have purchased of Marty's, this is a hum-dinger (bet you haven't heard that phrase in many a day).  Guess I have just given my age range away.  Oh well....... I'll just turn more Marty music on and my day will be super!!! The title doesn't do justice to this album; it's much more than a standard ""Best of..."" album.  These really are some of his top songs and several are very hard to find elsewhere. I've got 3 copies of this CD just to make sure I will always have it handy.Some of the rare songs are ""Walking Piece of Heaven,"" ""Don't You Think,"" ""20th Century Drifter.""  The wonderfully-performed song ""Love Me"" is especially difficult to find on other albums; it's the song that Jeanne Pruett (no relation to me) wrote for him and was always a favorite with the audiences when he sang it live on the Grand Ole Opry. Buy the CD for this song alone!  The songs ""Life,"" ""A Man and a Train,"" ""It takes Faith,"" are the kind of inspirational songs Marty did so well, and ""Crawlin' On My Knees"" is a very traditional Marty type of song.  This CD also showcases what a top songwriter Marty was and how emotional he could be.For those who loved, and still love, Marty's music, this is one of the best CDs you can buy. This is a great CD, it has one song, Life, I think it was the last before he died, it is hard to find on a CC, and it goes without saying all the other songs are great It's not the best album of M.R. music but it gives you some interesting songs instead of  just listening to his biggest hits. I'm not sure if the song ""A Man and a Train"" stand well on it's own but if you see the film ""Emperor of the North"" in which it was used it's very effective for that purpose. Marty Robbins' best work was undoubtedly on the Columbia label and these 10 are from his short sojourn with MCA. The best song on here is 'Life' which is Marty's 'My Way' and is a Marty Robbins original of the highest  standard. Personally, I like 'A Man And A Train' (from the Lee Marvin movie) which Marty really belts out and showed how Robbins could cross the tracks so effortlessly from Country to any other genre. All in all, not a bad album but there are many better ones by one of the greatest talents ever to grace Country music. Other tracks include 'Love Me', 'Crawling On My Knees', 'Shotgun Rider' and a tipping of Mary's stetson to 'The Father of Country Music' Jimmie Rodgers with 'Two Gun Daddy.' As a side note, I believe ther is still some unreleased material from his post MCA days on Columbia which hasn't seen the light of day yet.Why?! Previous review by another reviewer indicated &#34;A Train and a Man&#34; was a cut that should not have been part of this great album. I purchased  &#34;Best of Marty Robbins&#34; to obtain &#34;A Train and a Man&#34;, having sought it out since seeing the movie wherein he sang &#34;A Train and a Man&#34;. Great song by a great singer who will not soon be forgotten! There are very few cases in which Marty Robbins did not deliver a good rendition of a song he took on, but the fact that one reviewer exalts the train song and another calls it the weakest part of the package tells a lot.  Marty Robbins is on record as having said he made a mistake in leaving CBS (Columbia) Records and that his career had suffered. The songs here are the ones he recorded while NOT with Columbia.  YOU figure it out. I love this cd.  It has songs that are found on none of his other cd's.  In particular Twentieth Century Drifter.  I was looking for that song.  It is not in ITunes or on any other cd. I am very pleased with this record and also with the prompt delivery. Thank you. This is a fine CD indeed!  Most people are only familliar with Marty Robbins' hits for CBS, but there was a time in the early 1970's when he left CBS and, for a brief time, recorded for Decca/MCA, and these are some  of those priceless recordings.  This set starts off with the beautiful  &quot;Walking Piece Of Heaven&quot; followed by &quot;Love Me&quot;, a song  with much the same sound and feel of &quot;Begging To You&quot;.  On  &quot;Twentieth Century Drifter&quot;, he sings of being a race car driver  who dreams of winning first place and while just can't seem to live his  dream, the woman in his life loves and understands him.  &quot;Don't You  Think&quot; and &quot;Crawlin' On My Knees&quot; are honest-to-goodness  heart  breaking Traditional Country tear jerkers, while &quot;Life&quot; is  a bit more the Marty many remember hearing with the &quot;crossover&quot;  sound that he, Ray Price and Jim Reeves made so popular... Strings and  orchastra notwithstanding, Life shines through like a piece of gold and  makes you think about what's important. &quot;A Man And A Train&quot; is  the weak point of the album and is really not even worth talking about.  &quot;It Takes Faith&quot; is really uplifting and inspirational, and  serves as a reminder that we need faith in God to make it through the tough  times: As the song says, &quot;it takes faith to climb each mountain and it  takes faith to face this life.&quot;  The set finishes off with &quot;Two  Gun Daddy&quot;, which actually sounds like a Jimmy Rogers song and makes a  fine ending to this package of songs.  Buy this one. This is Marty at his  best!","Classic Country,Oldies & Retro,World Music,Cowboy,Country,Pacific Islands,Hawaii,Pop,Rockabilly,Rock,Nashville Sound",every collection purchased martys hum dinger bet havent heard phrase many day guess given age range away oh well ill turn marty day super title doesnt justice much standard best really top several hard find elsewhere ive got copies cd make sure always handy rare walking piece heaven dont think th century drifter wonderfully performed love especially difficult find jeanne pruett relation wrote always favorite audiences sang live grand ole opry buy cd alone life man train takes faith kind inspirational marty well crawlin knees traditional marty type collection purchased martys hum bet heard phrase day guess age range away ill ill turn turn day super title justice standard best really hard find got copies cd make sure sure handy rare walking piece heaven think century drifter wonderfully performed love especially difficult find jeanne pruett pruett relation wrote favorite audiences sang live grand grand ole opry buy cd life man train faith kind inspirational knees traditional type
408,795,B000000D0C,"I am a fan of Frank Ifield's but not all that many of his songs were released in Australia so it is great to catch up with him.  He combines his country and western style with standard popular tunes and makes them his own creation.  He is very enjoyable to listen to.  I'd recommend him to anyone who likes the combination of country and western, a bit of yodelling and standard songs.  His CD will be played many times.Annette. This is yet one more example - among many - of a ""Best Of"" compilation from Curb that leaves off far too many legitimate charting sides to be given a rating higher than 3 stars.Born on November 30, 1936 in Coventry, Ifield was raised in Australia before returning to the U.K. at age 23. His biggest hit by far, a # 1 in the U.K. and distributed on this side of the Atlantic by Vee-Jay and then Capitol, was I Remember You which peaked at # 1 Adult Contemporary (AC) and # 5 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in October 1962 b/w I Listen To My Heart (not included here) on Vee-Jay 457. What probably sold it more than anything else was the falsetto, which he used on all of his subsequent discs, even to the point of emulating the old Country star Elton Britt by breaking into a yodel here and there.He followed that with the immortal Hank Williams' hit, Lovesick Blues, another # 1 in the U.K. but just missing the Top 40 here, topping off at # 44 Hot 100 in January 1963 b/w Anytime (also omitted) on Vee-Jay 477. That October he was back, this time with Capitol handling the releases, to take another oldie, I'm Confessin' (That I Love You) to # 1 U.K. and # 16 AC/# 58 Hot 100 in North America b/w Waltzing Matilda (Capitol 5032) . Both sides are missing from this Curb so-called ""Best of"" compilation, as are both sides of his last North American Hot 100 entry  Please, a hit for Bing Crosby in 1932 which levelled off at # 71 Hot 100 in January 1964 b/w Mule Train on Capitol 5089. Also left off is another British # 1, a cover of the Gogi Grant hit The Wayward Wind which reached # 104 Hot 100 Bubble Under early in 1963 on Vee-Jay 499 (b/w I'm Smiling Now - yet another omission).While the man could certainly carry a nice tune, it seems his stage presence was wooden, as was his acting career which began -and ended - in 1965 with the Australian film Up Jumped A Swagman. A definitive CD collection of all 8 sides of his U.S. charters is non-existent, which is totally frustrating to completist hits collectors. When I first saw the 2005 3-CD 64-track release from Emd Int' titled ""Frank Ifield - The Complete A-Sides And B-Sides"" I thought, at last! But no. That title clearly applies only to his U.K. releases as neither Anytime nor Please are included in that set either. Wow, how good is this.  I love all the songs on this cd.......and happily give it 5 stars plus.  Frank has a way of turning a song into a masterpiece.  Buy with confidence......it's that good. I was so delighted to find this album still available.  Frank Ifield's sound was so unique.  An Englishman from Australia, his music was very special to me from the very first time I heard him sing ""I Remember You.""  Every cut on this album rings the bell!  His music was seldom played in the US, but I heard it whenever I visited my Mom at her home up near the Canadian border.  From then on, I was a Frank Ifield fan! the only song that I remember was I Remember You. I played the cd and the  other songs were just as great as the first song. this cd is a great one to have in a collection. I would recommend this cd to others. thank you, don sr... This man has the most unbelievable voice.  Unfortunately, he lost the use of it early in his career.  These recordings are the only Not really a review but I am looking for Frank Ifields Tale of Two Cities Nashville-London  Prodiced inNashville Tenn. around 1962. Thanks whatever you can do. Am really enjoying this long forgotten wonderful voice.  Takes me right back to the good old days!  I was so glad it was available!Jerry His voice is magnificient. I just found him recently when thinking of my favorite sone. I'll Remember You....not the Elvis Presley version.  He is wonderful and surely must have sold a lot of records in his day. He is an elderly man now. I enjoyed listening to Frank Ifield songs. The song "" I Remember You "" was my favorite and the main reason I ordered the CD. Frank Ifield has a great singing voice! I have found other music downloads that have Frank Ifield but have been looking for one that had his version of ""Love Song Of The Waterfall"".  Finally here it is.  All of his songs are first rate and unique but this particular version of ""Love Song OF The Waterfall"" is stunning.  Those of us who remember the 1960's this is quite a find. Listen to the samples available.  Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Had thought about Frank Ifield often thru the years.

409,797,B000000D5N,"You hear more about chuck and b.b. but any early rock&amp;roll guiterist will tell you that scotty moore had to invent licks that no one had ever used before. In my books he was the first rock&amp;roll guitar player. I've  heard better guitarists but not on his early stuff until I heard Danny  Gatton absolutely nail mystery train on this album. We all expect Delbert  to use that razor blade and maple syrup voice to give us a new  interpertation of E's work.The only way to cover a legend is to make it  your own,(if you've got the pipes and the balls). But I don't think anyone  expected Danny to remind us that this whole thing started because of the  energy the Hillbilly cat&amp; the blue moon boys brought to the game. I'm  an old cat and I've found a brand new reason to believe that the music  didn't die.Christopher Dorman But, I will say more. Have a Little Faith in Me is terrific. Tell Me About It ~~ just goes to show you that Delbert can make anyone sound good.Love this CD If he don't get your MOJO working then you must be dead! His raspy up-beat voice gets my foot tapping with every song. Delbert strays from what he does best (soulful, bluesy R&amp;B and honkytonk), experimenting with rockabilly (&quot;The Sun Medley&quot;) and jazz (&quot;Just You and Me&quot;) with disappointing results. The former is nothing more than a showcase for Danny Gatton's overbearing guitarwork. His country-blues duet with Tanya Tucker, &quot;Tell Me  About It&quot;, is more like what we're used to expecting from him. But then he turns in a lazy performance on &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, a song where he really could have injected his usual enthusiasm which is sorely lacking on the entire CD. &quot;Have a Little Faith In Me&quot; &amp; &quot;One More Last Chance&quot; are sub-par ballads, far less than we normally get from Delbert. Although he closes it out with a good cover of Jerry Butler's classic &quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot;, it's too little too late. One thing lacking from this collection is Delbert's own clever, often biting lyrics. Normally, the music feeds off of the attitude he puts into his songwriting. That attitude is basically nonexistent here. This is not one of my favorite Delbert albums, although ironically it has his biggest single on it, ""Tell Me About It"" with Tanya Tucker.  Definitely not one of my favorites.  The only reason I am writing this is to counter balance the review about Danny Gatton's ""overbearing"" guitar work. My instinct is to insult the reviewer but that's pointless.  Gatton was a genius with his style work and I would buy the album just to hear his playing on ""The Sun Medley"".  Utterly brilliant.  What a tragedy that he took his own life at such a young age.  To the reviewer, we all have our own tastes.  I am thankful I don't have yours.","Country Rock,Adult Contemporary,Blues Rock,Country,Pop,Electric Blues,Modern Blues,Rock,Contemporary Blues,Blues",hear chuck b b early rock amp roll guiterist tell scotty moore invent licks one ever used books first rock amp roll guitar player ive heard better guitarists early stuff heard danny gatton absolutely nail mystery train expect delbert use razor blade maple syrup voice give us new interpertation es work way cover legend make youve got pipes balls dont think anyone expected danny remind us whole thing started energy hillbilly cat amp blue moon boys brought game im old cat ive found brand new reason believe didnt die christopher dorman say little faith terrific tell goes show delbert make anyone sound good love cd dont get mojo working hear chuck early rock amp roll tell scotty moore invent licks used used books books rock amp roll guitar guitar player player heard better guitarists early stuff heard danny gatton absolutely nail mystery train expect delbert razor razor blade blade maple maple syrup syrup voice new work way cover legend got pipes balls think expected remind started energy cat amp blue blue moon blue moon boys moon boys brought game old old cat cat found brand brand new new reason believe die dorman say faith terrific tell show delbert sound good love cd dont working
410,799,B000000DAK,"I found Mary Black back in the 90's through her very popular album &quot;Babes In The Wood&quot;. Since then I have purchased several of her other albums but never found one that quite captured the incredible magic of &quot;Babes&quot;...until now.  I listened to this album chasing the sunset westward on a cool fall evening and fell in love with this woman's singing all over again.  The song &quot;The Loving Time&quot; really got to me.  I need to review her discography further to find if there are more albums that strike in the same range. I got this CD by chance at my local thrift store but I'm writing to tell you that it is worth every penny Amazon is asking for it.  Mary Black has a beautiful voice that enchants and keeps you coming back for more.  I actually got tears in my eyes listening her sing &quot;Ellis Island&quot;, a song about an immigrant leaving for Amercia and saying goodbye.  At the same time, your toe will tap along to songs like &quot;Carolina Rua&quot; and &quot;Soul Sister&quot;.  Emmylou Harris sings a duet with Mary in the well known &quot;A Woman's Heart&quot;. And &quot;Bright Blue Rose&quot; is spiritually uplifting.  My very favorite song on this album is &quot;No Frontiers&quot; where Black sings with such feeling; her voice just soars.  I highly recommend this album as it has most of Mary Black's best songs up to the date it was released (1995). I've been in love with this lady's voice and delivery since I first heard her version of ""Who Knows Where The Time Goes"" some years back. I'm currently on a kick of listening to only my Mary Black collection.Not only her singing but the ararrangements of some songs are sensational IMNSHO. Be sure to check out ""Columbus"" (not what you might think) and ""Ellis Island"" (also not what you might think). What a gorgeous collection of music!!! This collection does sound, and read, like an album... though I've had this CD for 13 years, I just recently realized it is a compilation. Perhaps it is the way the songs are arranged, perhaps it is the strength of Mary's voice, perhaps it is the consistently excellent musicianship that weaves its way through every song... it is really all of that. The only song that seems to be a little out of place is ""Carolina Rua"" - but I love that song. Favorites? ""Ellis Island"", ""Bright Blue Rose"", ""No Frontiers"" and ""Summer Sent You"". I absolutely melt every time I hear Mary and Emmylou sing the duet ""Only A Woman's Heart""... that is a masterpiece. ""Columbus"" is a somewhat strange, but pleasant song. The only song I usually skip is ""Adam at the Window"". For some reason that song is irritating to me. Yes, it is ""easy listening"" in a lot of ways, but this is soulful, meaningful music. Mary manages to address spiritual concepts in several songs without sounding preachy or religious (""Bright Blue Rose"" and ""No Frontiers"" most obviously), and that is not an insignificant thing. One of my favorite mellow CDs and one of my overall favorites, period. I got this mainly for one song but wanted to hear more from this singer.  I am glad, since she has a different voice and I like her sound. I can't play the CD on my computer because of some scratch wear but the story has a happy ending.  I used iTunes on another computer (with a less fussy drive) and carried the files to mine.  All's well that ends well.  The music is lovely which is the whole point. I first heard Mary Black when I was in college and just fell in love with her singing.  She has an amazing voice.  Just sitting back and listening to her sing is very relaxing.  In addition, I really like the songs she has chosen for this CD.  I find the lyrics popping into my head throughout the day.  Her songs are easy to sing along with, as well, even if I can't sing like her (but then again, not many can).This is the perfect music for: listening to while working on boring paperwork (keeps the mind from being so bored).And the perfect music for: in the car, on a beautiful sunny day, when all is right in your life (at last).And, yes, this is the perfect music for: when you're feeling sentimental, perhaps a little sad, maybe missing a loved one.  Her beautiful voice helps you to feel just a bit less sad, and a lot more comforted.  You don't feel quite so alone anymore.I have other CD's of hers, but I have to admit that this one is my favorite.  (although I just bought her most recent one, from 2005, from Amazon a few days ago!!!)Kathy (Bob's wife) Great experience all around. The Cd sounds clear and strong, and the item itself showed no scratches or wear.

411,803,B000000DFH,"Great album all the way through-like good country music, it is soulful, introspective even, but keeps a steady pace and rich texture.  I have listened to it almost every day for several months and am not tired of it yet.  I can't say that many other albums have survived 100 listens as far as I am concerned.I came rather warily to this album;  for many years, all I ever heard of ""Irish music"" was either the folk stuff with tin whistle, fiddle, harp, and pipes; or the old-school tenors ala John McCormick and Morton Downey Sr; or else the sleep-inducing New Agey stuff ala Enya. But Mary Black, with The Pogues and a few others, is opening up a new horizon in world music for me.  I expect this album to survive another 100 listens and keep going strong. Unfortunately they hawked this as a 'new' album and yet it has tracks from previous Mary Black albums. Very disappointing but that's the record industry for you. And yet they wonder why they are losing business to down loaders. Mary Black has a beautiful Irish singing voice.  She has chosen a great selection of songs to sing.  It is wonderful to listen to her while I am driving down the highway.

412,808,B000000DI0,"This is easily Mary's worst album; a terribly uninspired collection. I couldn't find one good song on it. All of her previous albums easily outshine it. This is my favorite of all her albums. I love her Irish folk-songy style - but this one is completely different. I find it innovative with unusual and compelling sounds. Try it. It's different. It's Mary experimenting with different styles. I completely disagree with the main reviewer. I first heard this album over a decade ago and still find it wonderful. Btw, I've seen Mary in concert and even met her and chatted after that concert. She was lovely - and introduced me to her band and her daughter! Mary Black has a wonderful voice for pop/rock music.  Her ballads and traditional folk may be more famous, and you wouldn't want to be a Mary Black fan without owning the sorts of titles for which she's more famous (BY THE TIME IT GETS DARK, for example) .... but SHINE shows that she's every bit as talented at pop/rock as she is at Irish ballad.What people love about this singer is that she has some real volume to her voice, but at the same time, she manages to have the expressiveness normally associated with softer voices.  You can feel every line she sings despite the impressive ""umph"".I love the song MISUNDERSTOOD.  I love it because even though it's a pop number - which means you can easily sing along, and believe me, it's catchy enough that you'll be tempted - she never sings a line as though she can't hear the words.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  Some singers hit the notes beautifully, but you feel like they could be saying ANYTHING because their voices focus on the melodies, not the words.  Mary Black never seems to do that.  She's singing a pop song, which means she can't linger too long on any one note, she has to keep moving to keep the catchy melody going.  But every line comes out with awareness of the lyrics.  This song is great.  The line ""I thought he was saying 'good luck', but he was saying 'goodbye'."" would be boring in a lot of people's throats.  But with her direct expressiveness, you can feel the hurt of his rejection.  And what a catchy beat!I also like the fact that isntrumentation on this album NEVER overpowers her lyrics and song.  That's a trend that bothers me in pop music.  I hate it when I can't hear the lyrics because the singer's too caught up in showing off the voice or when I can't hear the lyrics because they've been synethisized and distorted to death or the electronic instrumentation drowns them out.  None of that happens here.  Coming from a folk tradition, Black probably appreciates the importance of words to a song.  Nothing overpowers or dries out her clear vocals.Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention:  I can't remember the title, but the song on this album that sings, ""She don't like the late night radio"" is one of my favorite pop songs.  Again - between the beat and her clean, rocking delivery, it's just a great song.Mary Black fans should be warned that she's trying something different here from usual.  But I can't see objecting to it when she does it this well!  I love this album. I first listened this CD in a music market through headphones with tear filled eyes. Music is so inspired and heartfelt that I haven't listened anything comes close to it yet. David Gray is the main composer here and I became his fan after I have listened Late night Radio and all other his stuff in this CD. a MUST buy !!! After reading the whining reviews here that lament Mary not putting out the same album year after year, I have to say they couldn't be more wrong about the quality of the music and the voice. On 'Shine' MB updates the music to bring it into the 90's, but retains all of her vocal quality and ability to emote and make us care about what she's got to say. A standout is her performance on Richard Thompson's 'I misunderstood' which she does far better than the writer himself. RT makes it sound like a practical joke. MB makes us remember when *we* thought someone was wishing us good luck, and was really saying good bye. Everyone evolves, including Mary Black. So put away the prejudices against up-to-date music and give an open listen. You won't be sorry. This is Black's worst album, or if we say it in another way: the worst  album by one of the greatest singers. The choice of the songs is bad, and  on top of it the production is soooooo bad you can hardly hear her voice,  if you stay until the end (try it!) you'll find at the end of the last  track a bonus song that is the only good song on the album. Better  forgotten, and just dont start by this Mary Black's album, start anywhere  else, I would propose No Frontiers, or Babes In The Woods. The last one  (Angels) is a good cd too. i first heard these songs while having lunch at an irish pub in boston - i was so impressed i asked the waitress who the singer was, and ran to my record store to buy the cd as soon as i returned home. my initial enthusiasm for this cd has not changed, the songs still sound great. i have come to realize that these soft rock songs are a little different from the folk songs that mary black is famous for, but that's ok, she has a powerful voice and the songs are good. everyone seems to love ""I Misunderstood"" , and i would also recommend "" I Will Be There"" Yes, Mary does pop too. But there are a couple of good songs here, perhaps three. The best for me is between &quot;Nobody lives without love&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot; but I'd agree that there is a tendency toward the  melodramatic in these and other songs of this album. And perhaps Mary  hasn't heard that other song &quot;You've got a friend&quot; by J.Taylor  (or was it C.King?) or even S &amp; G's &quot;Bridge over troubled  waters&quot; before she decided to do P.Brady's &quot;I will be there&quot;  cause maybe she wouldn't have bothered. And when the album reaches  &quot;Late night radio&quot; I just reach for the Stop button. But then  again I must be getting old.","Europe,Irish Folk,Ireland,Contemporary Folk,Celtic Folk,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,World Music,Rock,Folk",easily marys worst terribly uninspired collection couldnt find one good previous easily outshine favorite love irish folk songy style one completely different find innovative unusual compelling sounds try different mary experimenting different styles completely disagree main reviewer first heard decade ago still find wonderful btw ive seen mary concert even met chatted concert lovely introduced band daughter mary black wonderful voice pop rock ballads traditional folk may famous wouldnt want mary black fan without owning sorts titles shes famous time gets dark example shine shows shes every bit talented pop rock irish ballad people love singer easily worst terribly uninspired collection find good previous easily outshine favorite love irish irish folk folk songy style completely different find innovative unusual compelling sounds try different experimenting different different styles styles completely disagree main reviewer heard decade find wonderful seen concert met concert lovely introduced band daughter black wonderful voice pop pop rock rock rock ballads ballads traditional folk famous want black fan sorts titles famous time dark example shine shows bit talented pop pop rock rock irish ballad people love singer
413,809,B000000DLV,"I have this album...someplace. Or I used to have it. Somehow, out of a huge move with lots of valuable stuff, only two things disappeared, and both were Steve Goodman albums. For a long time, I told myself it didn't matter, I had lots of examples of his work, mostly sung by him but of course also by Arlo as he tells the story of how they met and how he came to record  The City of New Orleans. And then I knew I was lying to myself, and Steve would never do that. So I bought this old gem, and I'm dying to dance with my dog once again to the sardonic humor of Watching Joey Glow  Yup, it does that to you. It's going to be great to get back in the groove. I found out about Steve Goodman because of my John Prine addiction.  He's an amazing song writer and his guitar licks are worthwhile by themselves.  He died at much too young an age but there is a lot of his stuff on CDs.  Buy this one or most any other chunk of his work. I was looking all over for a song from this album ! BINGO _ &#34;A Dieing Cub Fan's Last Request &#34; is mine !! I bought this album simply because it had A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request.  Little did I know I'd be getting an album packed full of Goodman classics.First, let me start out with the first track, If Jethro Were Here.  This instrumental prize borderlines with the spiritual for me.  When I hear it, I imagine flying over a wooded area viewing rivers, and valleys below; as if I were an eagle soaring high above.The other great tracks on this album include Vegematic, which applies even today.  I know you'll be able to relate to this one!  Talk Backwards is a Goodman original that makes you wonder why no other artist has produced a song along the lines of this concept.Goodman's duet with John Prine on Souvenirs is a classic.  I promise you'll love this one.  Any baseball fan will appreciate Steve's rendition of Take Me Out to the Ballgame and his original A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request.Lastly, as a Jimmy Buffett fan, I never really cared for Buffett's recording of California Promises.  However, Steve seems to give it meaning and substance on this album.  Simply put, he wrote it, and he knows exactly how to make it work.  God bless the late Steve Goodman. No doubt - this is my favorite Steve Goodman album.  From the biting satire of Watchin' Joey Glow, to the tongue-twisting Talk Backwards, to the still-timely Vegematic, he'll have you rolling in the aisles.  Anyone who's parents ever took them to an ice show will have fond memories as well as chuckles to Old Smoothies.  His duet, Souvenirs, with John Prine is one of his best.  And especially if you know his history and love of the Cubs, A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request will bring a tear to your eye even as he shows you that nothing in life can't be overcome with a dose of humor.  His Rowboat came in; don't miss yours and this album. Although the vinyl record was visibly clean. The better selections had noticeable defects by listening. Record acceptable but, not excellent.","Singer-Songwriters,Contemporary Folk,Pop,Folk,Traditional Folk",someplace used somehow huge move lots valuable stuff two things disappeared steve goodman long time told didnt matter lots examples work mostly sung course also arlo tells story met came record city new orleans knew lying steve would never bought old gem im dying dance dog sardonic humor watching joey glow yup going great get back groove found steve goodman john prine addiction hes amazing writer guitar licks worthwhile died much young age lot stuff cds buy one chunk work looking bingo dieing cub fans last request mine bo used huge lots valuable stuff things disappeared steve goodman long long time time told matter lots examples work sung course tells story met came city new new orleans knew lying bought old gem dying dance dog sardonic humor watching joey glow great get back groove found steve goodman john addiction amazing writer guitar guitar licks licks worthwhile died young age lot stuff cds buy chunk work looking bingo dieing cub fans request mine
414,810,B000000DLX,"Hard to believe it's been 25 years since Steve checked out and that his legacy hasn't been better preserved. The sound quality of this CD is pathetic and needs badly to be remastered. It reminds me of listening to the AM dial on an old cheap transistor radio. I really enjoy Steve Goodman's talent as a musician and songwriter. Heard about him through Jimmy Buffett over the years. Buffett adopted many of his songs and put them on his albums. Too sad that Steve died several years ago. His gift is missed by many people. I've been wanting to acquire Santa Ana Winds for a long time now. The title cut is the only Jazz style number I think Steve did and it is excellent to say the least.

415,811,B000000DLZ,"I played the old 33 until I wore it out.  so many artists come together to make this catalogue complete.  John Prine's liner notes say it all! its not what I wanted. Ithought it was different than what it is. turns out prime prine is what i wanted. I am cleaning up and getting rid of cassettes which is the version I had of this.  I loved the album and haven't heard it for a long time.  Before I got rid of the cassette I came here to make sure it was available in CD.You won't be sorry if you like Steve Goodman's music, you get a real sense of him from the artists... and you won't be sorry if you just like folk music. I bought this as a gift for a family member and was told he was very happy with the disc and that the music sounded just as good as he remembered it being.A great CD at the best price I could find from a reliable seller. Thanks I have owned this album for many years on vinyl, but have enjoyed the music and musicans so much that I decided to up-date to CD.  It is a classic! If you were a Steve Goodman fan -- or if you've never heard of him but love the raw beauty and honesty of this musical genre -- this is a must-have.  With warm reminiscenses of friends like John Prine and Arlo Guthrie and the powerful singing of so many greats, this recording of a tribute concert is a treasure. Makes you sad that this artist died so young... some fine music we will never hear. Steve Goodman was a special performer and songwriter.  His unassuming manner, sterling musicianship, sense of humor and exquisite songwriting made him a standout both in concert and in the studio.  This concert is a fine tribute from artists who loved him.  From his bosom buddy John Prine comes John's &quot;Souvenirs,&quot; Steve's great &quot;My Old Man,&quot; and a marvelous teaming with Bonnie Raitt on John's &quot;Angel From Montgomery.&quot;  Ed Holstein who was one of Steve's good friends does &quot;Blues That Steve Taught Me&quot; that's hilarious.  One of my favorite Chicago singers is Bonnie Koloc who does a great bluesy rendition of Steve's &quot;I Can't Sleep&quot; with her crystal clear voice gracing each note.  Other notables are John Hartford doing his &quot;Gentle On My Mind&quot; and Arlo Guthrie on &quot;All Over the World&quot; and his great hit that Steve wrote, &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; with its sunny &quot;Good morning, America, how are you?&quot; chorus.  The number of musicians here like Richie Havens, David Bromberg, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and the exquisite Jethro Burns attests to the high regard so many had for Steve.  This is a great little walk down memory lane from one of our music's dearest hearts, Steve Goodman.  Enjoy! I was at this concert and the album brings back wonderful memories.  If you love folk music buy it now. ...I don't know THAT much about Steve Goodman, despite being a boomer who follows the music of ""our generation"" pretty closely. I know of course about Arlo and ""City of New Orleans"" and have heard recordings of Mr. Goodman performing it himself. (I'm not hallucinating that, am I?) I am familiar with most of the performers here.However, my sole motivation for buying this CD this morning was the intent to own a hard copy of David Bromberg's jaw-dropping performance of ""I Will Not Be Your Fool"". I've had that recording as an mp3 of unknown sourcing for years, and one more listen en route to work this morning made up my mind that I need to have it in a version of the highest quality possible. I listened to samples of all the other source CDs of Bromberg doing this song live, and settled on this album as being the source of the mp3 I've cherished for years.Looking forward to owning it with absolute legitimacy, and in CD-quality, and looking forward to the other performances by the other extremely reputable artists on this album. The old Chicago folk music scene is gone, The Earl and Ratso's and The Bulls are gone, and Stevie Goodman is gone, too; but the music lives on.  Those who remember The Earl of Old Town back in the '60s and '70s will smile warmly listening to this collection -- nearly all the tracks are well and fondly done, with one **HUGE** exception: the abortion that Arlo Guthrie made of ""City Of New Orleans.""I still cringe whenever I hear Guthrie's deliberate mistake and want to sing over it correctly (and sometimes do -- loudly, hoping to drown him out).  Guthrie may have had a hit single in that song, but he has ***NO PLACE*** here.  His tracks are the sole reason I give this recording three stars instead of five.  He never did fit at the Earl, was never a regular there (being an East Coaster and all that), and he doesn't fit here, either.  Not only did Guthrie again botch the melody line of the chorus on ""City Of New Orleans"" (as usual), but he's **never once** sung it correctly.  Moreover, his overblown, commercialized take on the tune subverted and obscured what the song was actually about.  It's not a happy, bouncy tune, although you'd never guess that from Arlo's version; more like a plea for recognition and hope in the face of faded dreams and bitter, worn-down realities.  Including Guthrie and his persistent error in this remembrance of Goodman is like preferring Judy Collins's over-orchestrated, gussied-up versions of Chelsea Morning and Both Sides Now to the spare, thoughtful originals written and recorded by Joni Mitchell: the commercial versions are parodies of the originals, all the more so because they weren't intended as such but are anyway.  No doubt that both Mitchell and Goodman enjoyed walking to the bank with the royalties, but the bitter price is that so many fewer people heard the originals and, in fact, may not even have known about the actual authors if not for the commercialized hits -- and even worse, many still think Guthrie and Collins, respectively, actually wrote those tunes.  Talk about insult -- !For the longest time, few people outside either Chicago or the folk music idiom knew about Stevie Goodman, but we here in town did, and we loved him.  He was our very own ""folk-slinger,"" a likeable, irreverent favorite son who seemed to have lyrics for nearly every occasion.  He was witter and more charming in person than most people knew, and he could tell a good yarn with the best of raconteurs.  Besides, we understood all the local inside jokes on tunes like Lincoln Park Pirates.  Goodman was prolific, too (much of his stuff wasn't recorded, including, I believe, one or two he co-wrote with Jimmy Buffett when nobody else knew about *him*, either).  While Stevie sang about that train years ago at the Earl, I was riding it back and forth to and from Champaign-Urbana, where I attended the University of Illinois and wallowed in the folk scene there.  I have memories of that worn-down, dingy train, the forgotten towns along the track, the few conductors, the 11th Street station on Michigan Avenue that is long since gone, and most of those memories are bittersweet, as is the song.  Arlo Guthrie never grasped that, though I suspect Woody Guthrie surely would have.The best tribute to Steve Goodman that one can make is to let him sing that song himself.  After all the live and collaborative versions, recorded and not, I prefer the original on Goodman's self-titled album.  That was the Stevie Goodman I recall (and yes, his ashes really ARE buried in his beloved Wrigley Field: he's ours forever).  Consequently, the most fitting thing *you* can do is skip or edit out Arlo's tracks and include Goodman's instead.  Then the old Earl Of Old Town crew will all be together again at last.  That really *would* be worth five stars. It was early 1985, or maybe late 1984.  I was pregnant with my first son.  We would not have missed it for the world.  I was listening to this CD just now in the car, and when Arlo Guthrie invites everyone to sing along to City of New Orleans, I started singing - and promptly burst into tears, just like 24 years ago.  There will never again be anyone like Steve Goodman, but there were a lot of very talented people who loved him.  This is a great CD! I love this song Bonnie Raitt does a fabulous job on the vocalS. this is the first song I heard that actually made me feel the music. Thats why i download it on everything I own.

416,812,B000000DM1,"I purchased three Steve Goodman CD's based on a review someone else wrote saying he was a better songwriter than Bob Dylan...he was nuts.  They are pleasant enough but not anywhere near as meaningful the lyrics of Dylan. I love Steve Goodman. His version of City of New Orleans was the original and the best. The work with Jethro Burns is beautiful and enough sound and harmony to epitomize Goodman's strengths. OK the version of the Dutchman is a keeper but the rest of the ""studio production"" stuff is way over produced and sounds like the era it was produced in. I am a fan of re-mastering material if it makes it sound better but if the old style reverb still sounds like singing into an empty dumpster then why bother. Let well enough alone and savor the CD versions of the LP's in the most recent release you can Find. Some things shouldn't be released or re-leased.Steve Rest in Peace Unfinished Business is a fine collection of songs by the late, great Steve Goodman. It feels like a farewell, put together by Steve's wife, Nancy, in 1987. The cuts 1-7 are straight ahead, humorous, playful, and poignant Steve Goodman. The last three cuts are knife to the heart longing and sadness. What could have been if he'd lasted past leukemia.  For her, the unfinished business of this great musician's life.And I will mention it: Colorado Christmas is a great song (from me, a guy who lived in CA and longed for CO and played this at every Christmas until I returned home.) A fitting grab bag of this man's beautiful career. Own this recording if only for the Dutchman, even if you already have a version of this classic tune. This one stands out from other recorded versions. It's oddly downbeat, more than ever. It reduces me to tears every time. While you're at it, buy everything else this man has ever touched.

419,816,B000000DP1,"Super Chikan - Blues Come Home To RoostThe review by Bryan Newbury is dead on and I can't add too much. Though Super Chikan is a nephew of Big Jack Johnson, the guitar pickin is not really the focus of this music. What this CD is about is stories. Stories about life, people and circumstances. Stories you can understand and maybe even relate to (particularly if you have spent time in or lived in the southern US). That is what makes this so special - the songs take the front position over the instruments and they are excellent. Few contemporary blues musicians can paint pictures so simply and vividly with their music as Super Chikan and that makes this a stellar CD worthy of the 5 star rating. Very engaging blues with a delta spirit. Unusual and recommended! &quot;Blues Come Home to Roost,&quot; James &quot;Super Chikan&quot; Johnson's Rooster debut, is a worthy reissue for many reasons.  First, you will have to listen to A LOT of contemporary blues albums to come across  writing this original, heartfelt, and humorous.  Through the first five  tracks, one will find himself grooving to Chikan's  Mississippi-meets-Western Swing guitar style, one of the many hats he wore  on this album. Chikan composed many of these songs while in the employ of a  trucking company.  Once he got home from his runs he would lay down all of  the instruments to accompany the songs.  As a result, the listener is  treated to a work of uncompromising originality and personal history.  Unlike many other performers nowadays, Chikan has his own sense of  lyricism, avoiding the attractive yet overused AAB verse pattern.  The best  example of this is &quot;Down in the Delta,&quot; a lyrical portrait of  country life in the Mississippi that hits home with a combination of  despair (&quot;I've got a '71 Chevy &amp; the dealer wants to take it from  me&quot;) and optimism (&quot;Everyting is fine/ Peachtrees are blooming,  clothes hanging out on the line&quot;) so native not only to Mississippi,  but all of the Deep South.  Lyrical inventiveness and musical ability  aren't the sole reasons Super Chikan stands out, though.  Tracks 7 and 8  are musical humor worthy of Bobby Rush, with a freshness many can't touch.  If you're a fan of smooth blues music, intelligent and occasionally  whimsical lyrics and Southern culture, this album is not to be missed. Off beat lyrics sang with conviction and versatile guitar playing make Super Chikan &quot;The only Rooster&quot; in the current &quot;henhouse&quot; Blues scene! His Blues will also bring a smile to your face since they are not as sorrowful as many others, life has many things to feel good about!

420,819,B000000DQT,"Back in the late 1980's and early 1990's, there was a disturbing trend among some jazz artists to incorporate drum machines, sequencers and cheesy sounding sampled instruments instead of using organic instruments, possibly to lower costs. While these changes might have caused less problems personally and gave the music a 'hip' feeling, these recordings sound unbelievably dated a simple fifteen years later. On this album, Kim Pensyl attempts to cover a Babyface song with the aforementioned instrumentation, and the result fails miserably. Fortunately not every song on this CD is like this, and it is at these moments (like the wonderful 'Say You Will') that he adopts a more organic feel, thus giving this song a truly timeless quality. If you are a fan of less-than-organic jazz, feel free to purchase. Otherwise, try downloading. I share the same appreciation for the incredible F-1 GP pilot, Ayrton Senna.  I was surprised to even see his name on this CD and I'm glad that Pensyl dedicated his music to him.  Senna was a revolution to the F-1 community!  Now, the music.  Yes, his use of electronics in this album was nostalgic in that it sounded like it was from the late 70s and early 80s. However, that doesn't change my mind of his beautiful talent.  I personally think there should've been more compositions like ""Don't Look Back"".  The chorus does resemble Spyro Gyra but it's a music filled with a lot of chord variations...my kind of music.  If you want to hear his talent without the distortion of any electronics and drums, I recommend ""I Can Hear You Dreaming.""  Excellent piece.  Overall, I strictly rate a 4-star based on my personal taste.  It's often the case you buy a whole album and truly fall in love with only one or two pieces.  I would like Kim to continue playing and express his thoughts through his music with the world so I don't mind paying the extra for songs that didn't really vibe within me.  It's all for future investment and it's all good.

421,820,B000000DR1,"very easy to listen to.  Some of the transitions from baroque to jazz are a little abrupt, but the playing is beautiful. This wonderful CD brings new appreciation for both Vivaldi and Daniels, who is a virtuoso. I am taking a course in Jazz and the teacher's teacher is Eddie Daniels.  He lives not far from where I live.  I belive this CD is the best he has ever done.  It is basically the 4 seasons with a bit of a jazz twist.  Then, Eddie composed his own season, which is a bit neutral because it is  not exactly a particular season like Spring, Summer, Autumn, or Winter.  Anyway, all of the tracks on this CD are good and it is nothing to miss out  on. Eddie Daniels is known for his liquid improvisation and unbelievable creativity in the jazz idiom, but his Julliard training surely shines through here in The Five Seasons.Daniels treats these arrangements of Vivaldi with the utmost respect, but brings the recreative, interpretive art of music to new heights with this amazing performance.  The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra plays flawlessly under the baton of Bernard Rubenstein, Jorge Calandrelli's arrangements are extraordinary, and the rhythm section grooves right along (check out Dave Carpenter's bass playing on the second movement of &quot;Summer&quot; around 1:20 -- very, very hip).  I would be remiss to ignore the incredible engineering work done by Armin Steiner -- many classical and jazz albums fall flat because of poor sound engineering -- this recording sounds like you're actually there, in spite of the problems inherent to the CD format.  Excellent sound design and the collaborative chemistry of the performers themselves combine here to create the single most amazing classical or jazz CD in my collection.Daniels is at his best here.  His technique is flawless as always, his intonation is perfect at every moment, and his tone is undeniably what every clarinetist should strive to achieve.  While his technique is amazing, it's not at all the focus of this recording.  Daniels transitions between the jazz and classic idioms so fluently that one often has no idea it's happened until it's too late.  Daniels' improvisation never feels out of place, and is always informed by the baroque idiom.The Four Seasons has become worn out by dozens of so-so performances, but Daniels et al breathe new life into Vivaldi.

422,821,B000000DR9,"This is a basic cd for enjoying music and being mellow. I didnt' knock my socks off or anything but its a respectable jazz ce. There is no way about . Chuck Loeb , Peter White , Jonathan Butler , Earl Klugh , Russell Malone , Craig Chaquico and Jeff Golub are in this moment the cream of the cream in the smooth jazz to date .Specially this one , what inspired mood . Consider Bells (the best track in my  opinion). Of course The music inside , Cruzin south, la Siesta and Shangai are outstanding pieces too . But what it is remarkable is the fact that Chuck Loeb is a very gifted musician and knows playing the guitar with velvet touch and eloquent erotism . It suggests you much more than you ever imagine ; very appropriate to pass by with your fiancee or your friends in a familiar meeting , may be you decide to get out far for the crowding world, for one hour . You put this CD and inmediatly you will be in another level .Extraordinary work . i discovered chuck loeb a few days ago.i also like heavy and rock guitar players but chuck is relaxing,exiting,tasty and sentimental!!i think it's enough. I first heard Chuck's 'Listen' and have worked my way back to 'The Music Inside' and it is a great CD from the title track to my favourite, 'Mont Pelee', which is a stunning acoustic Spanish flavoured piece that just has  me wanting more. If you like smooth jazz guitar you'll love this CD!  If  you haven't discovered Chuck Loeb's music yet this is a great place to  start. I was tempted to buy this CD back in 1998 after hearing it on the radio.  Loeb has a nice flow of music.  Preferably on the tracks, &quot;Going South&quot; and the title track.  I didn't mind some of the vocals, but its the smooth guitar sounds that I recommend on this album.","Smooth Jazz,Jazz,Pop,Jazz Fusion",basic cd enjoying mellow didnt knock socks anything respectable jazz ce way chuck loeb peter white jonathan butler earl klugh russell malone craig chaquico jeff golub moment cream cream smooth jazz date specially one inspired mood consider bells best opinion course inside cruzin south la siesta shangai outstanding pieces remarkable fact chuck loeb gifted musician knows playing guitar velvet touch eloquent erotism suggests much ever imagine appropriate pass fiancee friends familiar meeting may decide get far crowding world one hour put cd inmediatly another level extraordinary work discovered chuck loeb days ago also like heavy rock guitar players chuck basic cd enjoying mellow knock socks respectable jazz ce way chuck chuck loeb peter white white jonathan jonathan butler butler earl russell malone craig craig chaquico chaquico jeff jeff golub golub moment cream cream smooth smooth jazz jazz date specially inspired mood consider bells best opinion course cruzin south south la siesta shangai outstanding pieces remarkable fact chuck chuck loeb gifted musician knows playing guitar velvet touch eloquent erotism suggests imagine appropriate pass fiancee friends familiar meeting decide far crowding world world one hour cd level extraordinary work discovered chuck chuck loeb days heavy rock rock guitar guitar guitar players players chuck

Exceptional.  There are hints of the Crusaders as well as more commercial smooth jazz artists, but Bob Baldwin does have a sound his own.  Playing many of the instruments himself, he clearly has serious chops and a great ear for arrangements.Nearly all the songs have a strong sense of swing and looseness that is absent from a most of the calculated (and overly produced) smooth jazz genre found on the airwaves.I'm looking forward to hearing if the rest of his stuff continues in this vein as this disk is 10 years on.

430,830,B000000DSX,"Marion Williams was one of Clara Ward's singers.  She was very good and this CD shows it.  It has great versions of ol'time favorites like ""How I got over"", ""Precious Lord"", ""Stand by me"" (the second best version I've heard, after Mavis Staples'), ""In the upper room"" (if you're used to Mahalia's version, get ready: this one's got rythm). Growing up, even though I'm only 20, I didn't really care too much for the voice of Marion Williams. Now, as I've grown older, I can see just what a magnificent singer she was. As I once heard someone say, she has such &quot;soaring beauty&quot; like a bird. I love this CD! And I give it 5 more stars!On the other hand, I give Shanachie Entertainment Corporation 2 stars. Like with other CDs that they have put out (GREAT GOSPEL WOMEN I &amp; II, GREAT GOSPEL MEN, etc.), they tease people with the songs- they butcher the songs up so bad, and right before the song really gets &quot;rockin,&quot; they fade the songs out. I understand that many people don't like the &quot;hoopin and hollerin&quot; of Gospel music, but that's part of what Gospel is! I come from a wild Baptist/Pentecostal background, and I know that quite a few others do also. We would like to have the entire tracks released- shouting, hollering, screaming...etc. If companies can release 8-12 minute tracks of HEAVY METAL OR PUNK MUSIC, and then have another 2-4 minute reprise, these Gospel issuers can release atleast 4-5 minutes of purified BLACK Gospel!For example, take the song &quot;Packin' Up&quot; which is track 23. The song is 2 minutes and 7 seconds. Right before everybody (Marion, the Stars of Faith, and the audience- and I...LOL!) started getting happy and cheering, what happens? It fades out! That really takes away from the entire song. It leaves us wondering and saying &quot;What happens next?&quot;I understand that we can't make everyone happy, but if you're trying to reveal and unveil the beautiful artistry of a gifted artist, then the different sides should be shown.GREAT CD over all!","Pop & Contemporary,Christian,Pop,Traditional,Gospel,Urban & Contemporary",marion williams one clara wards singers good cd shows great versions oltime favorites like got precious lord stand second best version ive heard mavis staples upper room youre used mahalias version get ready ones got rythm growing even though im didnt really care much voice marion williams ive grown older see magnificent singer heard someone say quot soaring beauty quot like bird love cd give stars hand give shanachie entertainment corporation stars like cds put great gospel women amp ii great gospel men etc tease people butcher bad right really gets quot rockin quot fade understand many people dont like quot hoopin hollerin quot gospel thats par marion marion williams clara clara wards wards singers good cd shows great versions favorites got precious precious lord lord stand second best version heard mavis mavis staples staples upper upper room room youre used mahalias version get ready ready ones got rythm growing really care voice marion marion williams grown older see magnificent singer heard say quot soaring beauty quot bird love cd stars hand shanachie shanachie entertainment entertainment corporation stars cds great great gospel gospel women amp great great gospel gospel men people butcher bad right really quot quot fade understand people quot quot gospel par
431,832,B000000DT1,"Once in a lifetime you discover music that touches your soul.  This is exactly that.  Heart wrenching and beautiful; an amazing aural glimpse into a glorious past known as ""THE WEST"". Rick Burns' production was incredibly enhanced by the music from Brian Keane.  This album is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection that is interested in the conquest of the West and the mix of people that came to claim the land.  Of course, the land was not vacant, and the West was lost to the native peoples of this continent.  A companion to The Way West may be easily found in How The West Was Lost, recorded onto two individual albums, by Peter Kater.  Every bit as emotionally capturing as Keane's music, but, from a decidely different perspective. This music is so wonderful that I have played it numerous times - so many that I literally wore it out. I'm purchasing a new one today as a result. This cd came promptly and was in great condition. The music was superb. I would recommend this music to anyone. I RECENTLY CAME ACROSS THE DVD OF THE DOCUMENTARY AND CHECKED THE INTERNET FOR THE SOUNDTRACK. I FIND THE SOUNDTRACK ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO LIKES THIS TO TYPE OF MUSIC. It is a soundtrack. It jumps from relaxing Native American music to hoe down fiddle music. Not what I was expecting by the other reviews. If you liked the documentary and want to re-live it to music then feel free, but it is all over the place. All wrapped up in one cd set, highly recommended, but listen to the samples first. If you don't like them, go back to Kronos!  I heard a sample of this cd set on the radio show called ""Hearts of Space"" back in the 1990's and had to have it. I wore that one out so I purchased another.  Does any one know if there is sheet music for this masterpiece? After I watched PBS' production of ""The American Experience: The Way West,"" back in 1994, I was moved to tears not only by the tragedy of what was done to the natives of our country, but by this hauntingly beautiful music which accompanied it. I HAD to buy it immediately. Rarely have I owned a soundtrack album where 95% of the music is relaxing, emotionally-moving, yet haunting. I am so very happy this is now available online, for I since have played the heck out of that 2-cd album, and it's a bit scratched. A huge recommendation for anyone who appreciates such music, which, for me, has mostly a native american theme...and thus, it is a wonderful introduction to this musical genre.

432,835,B000000DTL,"When I was looking for something new at Best Buy, I had to sift through a ton of unoriginal, cookie-cutter mainstream trash before I got to the Folk section. But that's another story. I picked up &quot;The Big Kibosh&quot; not knowing what kind of music it was, i just thought the cover was interesting. Well, i was pleasantly surprised-accordions have never sounded as good as this before! I do like that they have an accordion; some bands choose to go without one, and that can be good too, but this accordionist is accomplished beyond belief! They start out on the right, upbeat, crazy note with the spirit-lifting &quot;Wake-up Call&quot;, which puts you in the mood for the wonderful craziness that pervades the rest of the CD, stopping only for &quot;transition to buffet&quot; and picking right back up again. I would not recommend spinning this one when you are uptight, nervous or anxious, because the many different sounds, the fast pace and the ever-changing tempos and tunes sre not meant to calm you down. Some of the songs near the end of the CD give the impression that they were running low on inspiration, but just when you're about to skip back to the early tracks, on comes the spectacular violin-based &quot;Bob's birthday song&quot;, where the phrasing is so vivid that you can just see the circus clowns serenading their friend Bob. &quot;Bweep Bweep&quot; could have been improved by stopping after 10 minutes, but it is a fantastic, catchy song. Overall, a fantastic intro to the wonderful world of klezmer music. This group has really got it together.  They've managed to take klezmer music and combine it with innovative and exciting modern jazz rifts and style.  The music also reflects they're New Orleans heritage which adds an additional element of complexity and excitement.  This album is an absolute must for anyone who believes groups should not play to the lowest common denominator!!!!!  Itzhak Perlman would add some real spice to his act with this group in tow! Although it might seem downright crazy to try to combine Klezmer music with a New Orleans musical sensibility, after you listen for a while, it all starts to make sense. Hearing Jewish dance music with a gypsy flair combines with a Second-Line beat is quite a bit of fun. Zydeco has no monopoly on energetic danceability: it would be fun to see these guys in a battle of the bands at the Rock 'n Bowl--I'm sure they could hold their own! Fun stuff, well recorded, and guaranteed to broaden your musical perspective. What more could you want? The New Orleans Klezmer All Stars combine Jazz, Funk and Klezmer together into a wild style.  The combination isn't as weird as it would seem; Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman both had at least some influence of Klezmer in their music.  The NOKAS, though, take their music into the modern age with a blaring free jazz sensibility as well as a much more direct influence from Klezmer.  The album is a fascinating experience throughout.","Jewish & Yiddish,Jazz,World Music,Pop,Folk",looking something new best buy sift ton unoriginal cookie cutter mainstream trash got folk section thats another story picked quot big kibosh quot knowing kind thought cover interesting well pleasantly surprised accordions never sounded good like accordion bands choose go without one good accordionist accomplished beyond belief start right upbeat crazy note spirit lifting quot wake call quot puts mood wonderful craziness pervades rest cd stopping quot transition buffet quot picking right back would recommend spinning one uptight nervous anxious many different sounds fast pace ever changing tempos tunes sre meant calm looking new best buy sift ton unoriginal cookie cookie cutter cutter mainstream trash got folk section story picked quot kibosh quot knowing kind thought cover interesting pleasantly surprised accordions sounded good accordion bands choose go without good accordionist accomplished belief start right upbeat crazy note spirit lifting quot wake call quot mood wonderful craziness pervades rest cd stopping quot transition buffet quot picking right recommend spinning uptight nervous anxious different sounds fast pace changing tempos tunes meant calm
433,836,B000000DTW,"Great record!  I've been wondering for ages who this guy was. I'd heard a Dar Williams cover and a song on a compilation, but it wasn't until the CRY CRY CRY cd that I finally put it all together. This guy is something  special.Incredible writer. Voice that makes you weep.A great addition to  the list of introspective male singers.If you like David Wilcox or John  Gorka(or Jackson Brown or James Taylor for that matter)you'll love this  guy. I first heard Richard Shindell while listening to an NPR station in Minnesota (I think) many years ago.  I was listening via the web.  I was immediately drawn to his music.  And his VOICE... simply amazing!  I spent quite a while tracking down that station's playlist to find out who he was.  I finally did... then immediately went to Amazon to order Sparrow's Point.  After falling in love with the CD, I ordered three more CD's of his and have been a diehard fan ever since.  I guess ""folk"" music is his genre, but somehow his music transends that label.  I find his voice hauntingly beautiful.  This is not Peter, Paul, and Mary here folks (not that there's anything wrong with them!)  I highly recommend Richard Shindell. that a album was written with a song about the steel mills of Sparrows Point. My father, brother and myself worked long hot and hard hours. It makes me wonder if my father felt this may when he signed on in 1925. Overall it is a wonderful album. Songs/lyrics are spot on and very soulful. I'm glad I stumbled upon Richard Shindell on Pandora.Sparrows Point ""The Courier""  Listen Listen  Listen  This is a little better live, but a powerful song nonetheless.  ""Sparrows Point""  is a melancholy song that Richard rarely plays in concert.  I guess the masses want more upbeat songs.  It's a gem though.  ""Memory Of You"" and  ""You Again""  Listen Listen Listen is a masterpiece about the haunting of a lost love. ""Nora""  is along the same lines.  ""Howling At The Trouble"" and ""By Now"" tell amazing stories and will attract our souls and emotions. I was first exposed to Richard Shindell through my sister Joanie who guests on a couple of flute tracks on the record.  I hadn't heard of Richard at the time, but boy was I sure glad she gave me a copy.  It blew  me away and I've picked up every Shindell album since.  I'm never  disappointed with a Shindell album, but this just may be his best.  The  lyrics on this album come to life in a way that you feel you're a character  in each song and his vocal style is as pleasant as any I've heard.  You  won't be disappointed! The songs on this album are some of the best written music I have heard in a very long time. His work is amazing both lyrically and musically. I have never owned or listened to a folk album in my life.  My main musical interests are nowhere near what Richard Shindell does.  But one day I heard some of Sparrows Point and I was hooked.  The guy is just a great  singer/songwriter.  I have picked up all of his CD's and he continues to be  one of my favorite artists.  It doesn't matter if you like or don't like  folk.  If you love great songwriting then you will definantly love  Shindells work. Exceptional debut. The songwriting is taut and reflective, and the presentation is beautiful. I bought Reunion Hill several years ago and listen to it every now and then. I listen to this one repeatedly.  ""Nora"" and ""By Now"" are favorites. This album contains the greatest break-up song ever recorded: &quot;Are you happy now&quot;. It is a song at once funny, dry, and ultimately heart-breaking... much like John Prine, Shindell has the ability to crack a joke that will both make you laugh, and totally bring the whole emotional weight of song crushing down on you. The idea of someone walking out of a relationship on Halloween and taking all the candy with them... brilliant! To me, the rest of the album is a bit of a mixed bag... quite literally. It seems like a sampler or a calling-card... stylistically all over the map, country-western truck driving songs, english-folk style ballads, depression-era ballads, religious paeans... it jumps around a lot and ultimately lacks the cohesion that binds his later works (&quot;somewhere near paterson&quot; is great example)together as whole pieces. This CD seems like a great songwriter, intent on showing everyone how many styles he is proficent with. In all fairness, the results are always musically and emotionally satisfying, rather than academic, but it's worth noting. Wow, tell me it doen't have the lamest cover art ever, though? bad photo, cheesy looking type-face. Ugh. Don't judge this one by its cover. An amazing debut, all things considered, and &quot;are you happy now&quot; is probably still his best song. Sparrows Point is a really good record.Two songs are great:#2 The Courier &#11 By Now I have only recently become a fan of the so called ""contemporary Folk"" genre. I am so grateful for the internet and amazon.com for providing a venue for us to share our musical tastes, and lesser known talents. You won't hear Richard Shindell on the radio unless you live in one of the very few cities that has a Folk Radio Station, but if you do happen along one of his songs you will be hooked like me for life. Regardless of whether you like Folk, Rock, Soul, Americana, Country, you will undoubtedly like Shindell. He is a master of his song writing craft,and he has a beautifully rich voice that dances perfectly with his poignant songs. He writes music and songs that you never quite get sick of.  He is a true gem of a musician and songwriter.  The song Sparrows Point sends shivers down my spine. And if you are looking for more, he's got it. His music knows no boundaries.

434,837,B000000DU3,"I bought this Cd for 'Constant State of Want' after it played on Public Radio.  I am quite pleased with the album.  Several of the songs are stellar - 'Jane', 'The Sixth Floor', 'Jagged Hearts', 'Scatter New Seeds', 'Something Wrong with This Picture' are all great songs.  The others are not bad, just unusual - you have to keep in mind that Lavin is a humorist so songs like 'Waiting for the B Train' and '*69' tell humorous stories.  'Waiting for the B Train' is hilarious - about people standing at the subway when someone thinks they see a puppy on the track and trying to get someone to go get it. I got this album after hearing some of Christine's humorous songs.  I was somewhat disappointed to find out that most of the songs on this album are serious.  They are not bad songs, they are just not what I expected.  And there are a few good funny songs.  Christine is a clever songwriter, and fans of contemporary folk would probably enjoy her music.","Singer-Songwriters,Contemporary Folk,Pop,Folk,Traditional Folk",bought cd constant state want played public radio quite pleased several stellar jane sixth floor jagged hearts scatter new seeds something wrong picture great others bad unusual keep mind lavin humorist like waiting b train tell humorous stories waiting b train hilarious people standing subway someone thinks see puppy trying get someone go get got hearing christines humorous somewhat disappointed find serious bad expected good funny christine clever songwriter fans contemporary folk would probably enjoy bought cd constant state want played public public radio radio quite pleased stellar jane sixth floor jagged hearts scatter new seeds wrong picture great bad unusual keep mind humorist waiting train tell humorous stories waiting train hilarious people standing subway thinks see puppy trying got hearing humorous somewhat disappointed find bad expected good funny clever songwriter fans contemporary contemporary folk folk probably enjoy
435,839,B000000DUG,"I liked his first two CDS, but I absolutely LOVE &quot;Reunion Hill.&quot;  Richard sings with such passion, and his songs are so sincere.  He amazes me because he can write from so many different perspectives, from a  fugitive in &quot;May,&quot; to a woman who lost her husband in a war in  &quot;Reunion Hill.&quot;  &quot;I saw my youth today&quot; makes me cry  every time I hear it...he is amazing.  I would definitely recommend this CD  to anyone who enjoys folk music. The wonderful mystique of Shindell is his desire to simply tell a story and count on his listeners to make the moral decisions.  Often, he tells the story from the perspective of a character who we aren't supposed to  trust, and sometimes that character is Shindell.  In &quot;Next Best  Western&quot; we get the story of a man who does not even want to trust  himself.  He wants faith so badly, but the closest he can come to realizing  faith is to trust that he will make it safely to the next hotel.  In  &quot;May&quot; we get the the story of a fugitive, from the unique  perspective of his wife and the limited information taken from rushed phone  calls.  These are stories that you will remember for the rest of your life.  They will change you without attacking you.  Richard Shinell's gorgeous  guitar playing and bright, substantial voice will bring you back for more. This one has become one of those CD's that I must return to every few months. The stories and the way Richard delivers them are compelling. There are only a few tracks that aren't on my favorite list. &quot;Darkness, Darkness&quot; is well done, but Jesse Colin Young (or even Mott the  Hoople!) had this one nailed long ago. Richard is best when dealing with  characters of his own making. I have listened to little of Richard beyond  this CD, so I can't compare it to his other work. However, I believe it  stands on it's own as a very fine record, indeed. Larry Campbell's work  here is especially appreciated. This is my favorite album from folk singer Richard Shindell. He puts the ""P"" in ""poignant."" I always look for a cynical view of Christianity in at least one, and found it right away in ""The Next Best Western.""  The reflective mood of ""I Saw My Youth Today"" resonates with me, partly because of the many witticisms. I had thought ""Money For Floods"" was timeless, but Katrina proved me wrong. His cover of Townes Van Zandt's ""I'll Be Here in the Mornin'"" is moving, and there's a great hidden track as well. I heard Richard Shindell on my local NPR station and instantly enjoyed him. His music is both relaxing and thought provoking at the same time. Highly recommended. Every song is a winner, this album, along with &#34;Sparrows Point&#34; and &#34;Somewhere Near Patterson&#34; are classics, full of carefully crafted songs that will never leave you head, even years later.  Catch Richard Shindell live if you can, he gives great low-key perforance... Shindell is one of the best songwriters to come from the 90's. But this cd is overproduced, and frankly, hard to listen to it without the skip buttom. Some songs are better, other just drawn in a very bad production. Go for &quot;Somewhere Near Patterson&quot; and &quot;Sparrows Points&quot; and wait until these songs are released on a live cd, or as acoustic guitar and vocals. Maybe one day... The songs are well written and the production has more of a country feel than some of his other CDs.  Richard Shindell is a masterful lyricist and the cuts on this CD provide some fine examples of his workmanship (i.e. ""He who made the lamb, put the tremble in the hand that reaches out to take my quarter."")  The recording has some issues with various pops and thumps in most of the tracks, and I only gave it three stars because of the recording quality. I know many of Richard Shindell's fans think the world of this recording, but it just has never quite hit the bulls eye like Sparrows Point and Blue Divide did. The song, The Next Best Western is probably my favorite song on  the album. I would probably recommend this album, but it should be the  third one of his to pick up. The first should be Sparrow's Point followed  closely behind by Blue Divide.","Singer-Songwriters,Contemporary Folk,Pop,Folk,Traditional Folk",liked first two cds absolutely love quot reunion hill quot richard sings passion sincere amazes write many different perspectives fugitive quot may quot woman lost husband war quot reunion hill quot quot saw youth today quot makes cry every time hear amazing would definitely recommend cd anyone enjoys folk wonderful mystique shindell desire simply tell story count listeners make moral decisions often tells story perspective character arent supposed trust sometimes character shindell quot next best western quot get story man even want trust wants faith badly closest come realizing faith trust make safely next hotel quot may quot get story fugitive uni liked cds absolutely love reunion reunion hill hill quot richard sings passion write different perspectives fugitive quot woman lost husband war quot reunion reunion hill hill quot quot saw youth today quot cry time hear amazing definitely recommend cd enjoys folk wonderful mystique desire simply tell story count listeners moral decisions tells story perspective character supposed trust character quot best western quot story man want trust wants faith badly come realizing faith trust safely hotel quot story fugitive

You can definitely see why she's was crowned the Queen of Reggae. Rita does an incredible job with the Rastaman anthem ""One Draw,"" and ""Thank You Jah"" & ""Who Feels It Knows It."" This album is certainly a must have for Rita Marley fans. Also check out ""We Must Carry On"" and ""Harambe"" (definitley her best album.) To be honest of the is album didn't have the song &quot;one Draw&quot; on it i probably wouldn't have bought it but this solitary song makes purchasing the whole album worth the coin spent.The rest of the songs on the album are performed well enough but none of them really stand out like &quot;one draw&quot;.

438,844,B000000DVJ,"Always we buy the album for the music of course, but I've always been impressed by this album cover, I think in the style of a Norman Rockwell painting.Top studio musicians teamed up on this 1981 release including Sly, Robbie, Earl ""Chinna"" Smith and an A-1 Brass section on what was probably their initial effort for the Shanachie record label. Besides the well known titled song, ""Illiteracy"" and ""Hunting Ground"" among others make this a highly consistent effort rhythmwise with fresh social content.  After their highly praised ""Right Time"" album and their ""I need a roof"" effort, this should be considered if you plan on continuing your Diamonds collection.Known for their beautiful trio harmonies, this album reflects the MDs with a more seasoned, mature roots music; together since 1969; Tabby Shaw has provided the lead vocals, Lloyd Judge Ferguson the lionshare of songwriting and Bunny Simpson rounding out the mix having been very involved in the production end at times.

439,845,B000000DVL,"I sure expected more from this.  I mean she was in the I Threes for crying out loud.  I was hoping for some old school reggae like Marley made.  Big mistake.  What was she thinking?  Was she trying to do 80's pop music to make some quick cash?  Did she really think she could do that with this music?  If you happen to listen to the other guy who raved about this album and buy it, listen to the first song's snare drum reggae intro and then skip to the next song and then skip again and again until you get all the way through it, because that's the only reggae you're going to find here.  The rest is pure sap.  Sorry Judy. The title of this album is Only A Woman.  That is indeed an understatement.  Hear Ms Mowatt roar and be impressed.  She is a gifted vocalist and songwriter.  This former member of the I-Threes continues to impress.  Judy Mowatt easily outshines  Rita Marley and Marcia Griffith with her output.  This follow up to Black Woman is an excellent album.  Any fan of reggae music should give this album a listen.  The opening track You're My People sets the tone for this album.  This is music with social consciousness.  There is no runt among the litter here.  Each track stands up on its own. The title cut is one of the stand out tracks on the album.  There is also a swaying cover of the Curtis Mayfield song You Don't Care.  Bob Marley must be smiling in heaven when Judy Mowatt sings her songs.  She has certainly made some great reggae music. Judy Mowatt is probably the greatest female reggae artists ever. She can sing, she can write. Just wish she made more albums cause what she did make is amazing.

440,847,B000000DVO,"This is one of my favorite reggae albums. Period. Judy Mowatt has enough soul in her pinky alone to float an entire 'soul fleet' (???).No, really, this album is strong in every respect.I can listen to it over and over. I don't care if it's ""not the real Jamaican Reggae"" [as others opin]...They are just great songs. What the hell else do you want?To listen to this music, you know that she is the real deal.You know that her heart is pure and that she is all about human empowerment and love for all.Beautiful music!On the other hand, it is the only record of hers I can listen to at all. The rest suck big time. I think she allowed too many cooks in her kitchen, so to speak, and sold out on her own special thing she originally had going. It was magical. magic. What a shame. I feel she started to get interested in going a little - dare I say - 'big time' It just didn't work for me. Her other music that I have heard is nothing compared to this album. Buy this and you will thank yourself (you could thank me too...) Peace cats.  Just buy it, I promise you, you will not regret it. If you're a fan of Bob Marley, you'll like Mowatt, who was one of the I-Three singers backing him up. She was a big part of his sound. Her voice is sweet and soulful, establishing an easy, swaying groove on every song.  The album has held up well over the years; when I put it on today, people  ask me interestedly &quot;Hey, this is nice -- who is it?&quot; Her sound  is pure and devotional, and like Tosh's and Marley's music, it moves you. Great album! Timeless classic!  Truly hope she has it redone to capture the more modern music technology! Love it immensely! Judy Mowatt has a great, versatile voice; a bit too versatile, in fact, because this CD includes a more American-style soul than I would have liked from a Jamaican album.I totally understand. It was hard enough for women singers in Jamaica and  with this album, Judy wanted to target a broader audience. Nevertheless, when it comes to the few female ""reggae"" singers, I prefer the purer roots sound of the Love Joys on the Wackies label. Although classified as a reggae singer, Judy Mowatt has been strongly influenced by both R&B and Gospel music--something which is all too evident on ""Concrete Jungle"", ""Slave Queen"", ""Sisters' Chant"" and several other tracks included here. Judy is blessed with the voice of an angel and she is correctly viewed by many as the greast female reggae singer ever. Wether you are a Gospel, R&B or Reggae fan you are sure to enjoy this beautiful CD time and time again. going home to mount zion.. ahh now that's a nicesong.  So pleasant, as I meditate with some morrocian goldcream straight from the tangier mountains.. Sisters' chant is one of the pillars of the reggae firmament. It is worth the price of the album alone. Peter Colosi The correct track listing is: Strength to go through/Concrete jungle/Slave queen/Put it on/Zion chant/Black woman/Down in the valley/Joseph/Many are called/Sisters' chant. This is not my favorite Judy Mowatt album, because the production leaves a lot to be desired and her voice sounds thin and reedy at times. There are some great songs, however, like Strength To Go Through, Down In The Valley and Many Are Called. She also does interesting interpretations of Bob Marley songs like Concrete Jungle and Put It On. There is not enough variation in the sound. I think the use of different producers would have been a good idea. Still, the album is redeemed by some some strong material and should satisfy the fans. It's just not a reggae album with crossover pop appeal.","Reggae,World Music,Pop",one favorite reggae period judy mowatt enough soul pinky alone float entire soul fleet really strong every respect listen dont care real jamaican reggae others opin great hell else want listen know real deal know heart pure human empowerment love beautiful hand record listen rest suck big time think allowed many cooks kitchen speak sold special thing originally going magical magic shame feel started get interested going little dare say big time didnt work heard nothing compared buy thank could thank peace cats buy one favorite period judy mowatt mowatt soul pinky float entire soul fleet really strong respect listen dont care real jamaican jamaican reggae reggae great hell want listen know real real deal deal know heart pure human empowerment love beautiful hand record listen rest suck big time time think allowed cooks kitchen speak sold special originally magical magic shame feel started interested dare say big time time work heard compared buy thank thank peace cats buy
441,848,B000000DVS,"Hello Guys I would like to tell you about this incredible music. This albun can make you learn more about reggae roots during the time of 1971 to 1978. An amaizing Collaboration of Tommy McCook (horns, the best one), Piano Agustus Pablo, Drumer, Leroy Horsemouth Wallace. You have to buy it, for those who's like JAH Words and for those who's like good music. JAH BLESS YOU MANChazki I first heard this recording about 13 years ago when I was a studying in another country, absoulty blew me away, and started my love of reggae music. Get this if you want to hear pure unpolluted reggae. I still love it  after all those years. It should be noted that although Yabby You was and is the dreadest of  dreads, he is a Christian dread- a Jesus Dread. From a long time he used to  get into reasonings with Rastas who worshipped JAH through Hailee Selassie.  Yabby worships JAH through Jesus Christ- a big difference. This recording  contains some of Yabby's very best and is an excellent place to start for  those interested in the &quot;You-man's&quot; music. Backing is provided by  the cream of the crop of reggae musicians including Tommy McCook,  Horsemouth Wallace, Family Man Barrett, Augustus Pablo and others. All  tracks were recorded at Channel One Studios during the seventies and the  sound quality is excellent. This is reggae with a message for the end  times- apocolyptic roots and culture. Churchical harmonies and messages are  abundant, including the classic &quot;Conquering Lion&quot;, &quot;Deliver  Me From My Enemies&quot; and &quot;Carnal Mind&quot;. Every cut is strong-  you won't be disappointed if you enjoy conscious dreadlocks reggae music.  &quot;Judgement Time&quot; features a hard riddim with crucial horn parts  and lyrics like, &quot;People of the world, can't you see what's going  on?...judgement time, judgement time...nations fighting against one  another, brothers killing others, JAH Word they cast behind their backs, no  one- no one remember JAH.&quot; Awesome guitar work by the legendary Chinna  Smith is also a feature throughout.

444,858,B000000DX3,"this is a most excellent insight into the earlier years of reggae, and the version of small axe will not leave you alone.nuff respeck brudda higgs... Patrick L. Kelly, Sr. is right about one thing, he has very little knowlege.  Joe Higgs is clearly credited with writing Stepping Razor on Peter Tosh's Equal Rights album.  Maybe you should check your facts. This is a very solid CD by one of the founders of roots reggae. At times, however, it seems slightly overproduced, sophomorically utilizing new effects of the day (1990). Aside from that, most of the songs are great! Stepping Razor (later recorded by Peter Tosh) and Sons of Garvey are my two favorite tracks. Oh Carol, Small Axe, and Blackman Know Yourself are great songs as well, exemplifying Higgs' knack for writing creative and catchy compositions. One should know that the only two CDs currently available by Joe Higgs are this one and Family, which is probably his weakest CD minus the title track. If possible try and seek out his out of print titles &quot;Life of Contradiction, Triumph!, and Unity is Power. Any one of these discs is better in imo than Blackman and Family combined. Still if this is all you can find, do yourself a favor and pick it up before it's out of print too! A great roots reggae vocalist and long time associate of Bunny Peter and Bob (Higgs filled in for Bunny on the Wailer's excellent live &quot;Talkin' Blues&quot; because Bunny refused to travel to yhe U.S.), this album featues the Wailer rhythm section (Junior Marvin, etc). We lost Joe a year ago, but he left us with this excellent album, his best and a must have for roots fans. @ Patrick L. Kelly, Sr. &#34;Saints Fan&#34;::: Kelly, sorry to BURST YOUR BIG HEADED BUBBLE but you are WRONG ON ALL COUNTS!!! In fact, &#34;STEPPIN' RAZOR&#34; was penned by JOE HIGGS, was actually STOLEN by PETER TOSH, whom, AFTER A LONG COURT BATTLE, finally AGREED that the song belonged to JOE HIGGS!!! All right was then granted to the RIGHTFUL OWNER of the song, Steppin' Razor, made popular by Peter Tosh!!! Also, NOT MANY KNOW THIS... but &#34;SMALL AXE&#34; was actually co-written by BOB MARLEY and JOE HIGGS. Although both Marley and Higgs (2 small men) had combined lyrics for the song, the melody, however, was BOB MARLEY'S idea and so, BOTH MEN AGREED to credit the song to MARLEY!!! These are the reasons that Joe Higgs gives HIS rendition of both songs here and there!!! In conclusion... I would suggest you do some well needed RESEARCH before trying your &#34;CYBER-BULLYISM&#34; on those who KNOW!!! :) Mr. James Wax in SR,CA Stepping Razor was penned by Peter Tosh, and frist appeared on his 1977 album Equal Rights therefor Joe Higgs is covering Tosh's song, not the other way 'round as you opined. Ditto your mistake on Small Axe. That is actually a Wailers song, written by Bob Marley frist released in the mid 60's as a Ska number and eventully appearing on their Island LP Burnin' released 17 October 1973. If you are gonna' give non-review related insight, please get your facts straight. Don't be fooled by the overly condescending, know-it-all review from the insufferable Patrick L. Kelly, Sr. ""Saints Fan."" Despite his lecture, he is the one who demonstrates insufficient knowledge. ""Stepping Razor"" was indeed written by Joe Higgs, and while Peter Tosh's recording of it (clearly credited to Higgs) may have preceded this one, Kelly needs to realize that artists sometimes record their own versions of songs long after others have already popularized them. The song's lyrics don't even make sense for Peter Tosh, who at 6' 5"" seemed an unlikely author of the lyric ""I'm like a stepping razor don't watch my size, I'm dangerous."" The diminutive Higgs wrote those words, of course.My only criticism of this album is that it's too short -- I would love ten or fifteen more minutes of similar songs. Higgs keeps the arrangements simple, which helps to showcase his deceptively nimble voice. With its rousing call to action and anthemic melody, ""Let Us Do Something"" should have been a major international hit, and ""She Was the One,"" with its bubbling organ and bursts of piano, burrows its way into your brain in a most agreeable way. Another standout is ""Saturday Morning,"" a lover's lament with an incongruously lilting pace.With Higgs' death in 1999, reggae lost yet another of its great pioneers. It's a pity that he did not leave behind more of a recorded legacy, but what exists is of tremendous quality. I started listening to Joe Higgs in high school and Blackman Know Yourself still sits firm with his other collections. Done with the Wailers band, this CD is a must have. If you love reggae, it's time you know the source. Get this CD today. If you have a reggae collection, how can you not have the &quot;FATHER OF REGGAE&quot;?

THESE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TRACKS FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ALBUM!***""Pablo Meets Mr. Bassie: Original Rockers Vol. 2"" is more great Augustus Pablo from his classic 1970s period, and is well worth enhancing your music collection with.  Here Pablo works his magic in an instrumental, sometimes lightly dubby environment.  The tone of these works is similar to the heady, dense nature of Pablo's other classic LPs including, of course, the original ""Original Rockers."" ""555 Crown Street,"" for example, is an absolutely phenomenal melodica instrumental, the rhythm of which is dubbed up as ""555 Dub Street"" on the ""King Tubby's Meets Rockers Uptown"" LP.  Hearing the full, rich melodica cut of this rhythm is a thrilling, even revelatory experience, and ""555 Crown Street"" is up there with ""Cassava Piece"" and others of Pablo's finest works; one only wishes it were about three times as long.  ""Rocker's Rock"" is another tasty melodica slow-skank which is a melodica version of ""Rocker's Dub"" from the classic ""Original Rockers"" album.  ""Pablo Satta"" is an acknowledged Pablo classic on the famous ""Satta Massa Gana"" rhythm, and while it appears on some other sets, this is the clearest issue of it I've yet heard.  ""Power Of The Trinity"" nicely juxtaposes pensive, moody tones with lightly skanking percussion. Aside from his always killer melodica, Pablo indulges us with some xylophone, most notably on the gentle ""Golden Seal"" and the dubby ""West Abyssinia.""  Pablo also rocks some nasty clavinet on the funky ""Havendale Rock.""Another thing I enjoy about ""Meets Mr. Bassie"" is how it retains that mystical 70s roots feel, rather than being inundated with drum machines and synthesizers as Pablo's music, and Jamaican music as a whole, would become from the late 70s/early 80s onward. ""Meets Mr. Bassie"" was the same length as any other Pablo LP back in the day, but we have since become accustomed to extra CD tracks, which, sadly, Shanachie did not include any of here.  As a result, the half hour length may seem short, but be aware that this disc is a solid listen straight through, and whilst every track is not as brilliant as the ones I've mentioned above, it's unlikely there'll be anything you'll want to skip. As far as I'm concerned, for a nice listening session, where I'm closely paying attention to the music, 30-40 minutes is ideal anyway. Sound quality on this disc is pretty good, and excellent by Shanachie standards.If you've got the Augustus Pablo basics, ""King Tubby's Meets Rockers Uptown,"" ""Original Rockers,"" ""East of the River Nile,"" and Pressure Sound's amazing ""El Rocker's,"" and you're still itching for more, you can't go wrong with ""Pablo Meets Mr. Bassie.""  Some other competitive choices, assuming you've already dug the four cornerstones listed above, would include Trojan's compilation ""Skanking With Pablo"" and Pablo's early LP, ""This Is Augustus Pablo.""  Both of the last two discs present different facets of Pablo's creativity, ""Skanking With Pablo"" being looser and lighter, and ""This Is..."" being simpler and cleaner.  As far as ""Meets Mr. Bassie"" goes, it is more in keeping with the dense, haunting character of the first four titles I mentioned.In the final analysis, Augustus Pablo was a fascinating musician, and a true musical visionary; ""Meets Mr. Bassie"" is simply further proof of his genius.4 1/2 stars.","Reggae,Dub,World Music,Pop",important notice may sound samples posted cd pablo meets mr bassie original rockers vol completely different completely different pablo meets mr bassie original rockers vol great augustus pablo classic period well worth enhancing collection pablo works magic instrumental sometimes lightly dubby environment tone works similar heady dense nature pablos classic lps including course original original rockers crown street example absolutely phenomenal melodica instrumental rhythm dubbed dub street king tubbys meets rockers uptown lp hearing full rich melodica cut rhythm thrilling even revelatory experience crown street cassava piece others pablos finest works one wishes three times long rockers rock another tasty melod important notice sound samples posted cd meets mr original original rockers rockers completely different completely different meets mr original original rockers rockers great augustus augustus pablo classic classic period period worth enhancing collection works magic instrumental lightly dubby environment tone works similar heady dense nature classic lps including course original original original rockers rockers crown street example absolutely phenomenal melodica instrumental rhythm dubbed street street king king king tubbys king tubbys meets rockers uptown tubbys meets rockers uptown lp hearing full rich melodica cut rhythm thrilling revelatory experience crown street cassava piece works wishes times long rockers rock tasty

A must have for all Reggae Lovcrs I bought this CD several years ago for the simple reason that I like reggae and a man I had quite a crush on owned it. And thank god for that crush, because without it I would never have heard of Lucky Dube and would have missed out on a phenomenal musician.  This CD is, quite frankly, addictive.  The music is brilliant and the lyrics are fabulous.  Lucky Dube was a man who firmly believed in doing good with the life one has, and while artists like YellowMan were singing songs about ""girl don't you do like the man do"" Lucky Dube sang about poverty, equality, and racial discrimination.  He was fabulous and his live CDs are great - full of spirit, passion, and enthusiasm.Highly recommend this CD and, if you have yet to be sufficiently introduced to him, Lucky Dube himself. I have all lucky Dube Albums,,,,, but this one is my favorite,,, and my personal best song is Peanut Butter, , , I was not a reggae fan before I heard this album,,, but since then,,,, I don't listen to any music except REGGAE,,, and specially LUCKY DUBE... This is a pretty decent album.  Lucky Dube is real, roots reggae.  He can wail with the best of 'em and he's NOT Bob Marley (what?! there's other reggae out there!? OMG!).  On one of the tracks he hiccups a bit, which is funny... Lucky!  Were you DRINKING during the show!?  If you like reggae, and not just so you can include ""No Woman No Cry"" in your mix tapes to show how much soul you've got, this is one for the collection.","Reggae,Africa,World Music,Pop,South Africa",cd cherish obtained live concert vhs years ago recently got cd especially cherished gone earth due violence must reggae lovcrs bought cd several years ago simple reason like reggae man quite crush owned thank god crush without would never heard lucky dube would missed phenomenal musician cd quite frankly addictive brilliant lyrics fabulous lucky dube man firmly believed good life one artists like yellowman singing girl dont like man lucky dube sang poverty equality racial discrimination fabulous live cds great full spirit passion enthusiasm highly recommend cd yet sufficiently introduced lucky dube lucky dube one cd cherish obtained live live concert concert vhs years years ago recently got cd especially cherished earth violence bought cd years years ago simple reason man quite crush thank thank god god crush heard lucky lucky dube missed phenomenal musician cd quite frankly addictive brilliant lyrics fabulous lucky lucky dube man firmly believed good good life life life one artists yellowman singing girl man lucky lucky dube sang poverty equality racial racial discrimination discrimination fabulous live live cds cds great full spirit passion enthusiasm highly recommend cd sufficiently introduced lucky lucky dube lucky lucky dube

I am also an avid reggae listener and enthusiast.  I love this album it ranks up there with one of culture greatest works.  Listen to tracks 7 and 8 they are very hot.  Go buy this album so culture is able to tour the US more often, so we all can enjoy great live reggae music! A music fan from cape coast to Minnesota,since 1996.There has been many release from culture but  this release is the best,the words in the music are really inspiring.Reggae fun should buy it and will never regret it This is one of my favorite reggae cd's as it is easy on the ear.

BELIEVE IT THEY DELIVER YOUR  MONEY'S WORTH 100%! Good Culture album...  Two Sevens Clash and Harder Than The Rest are better in my opinion, but Wings Of a Dove is classic roots reggae, definitely worth owning if you have love for the reggae of that time as I do. &quot;Wings Of A Dove&quot; is without a doubt and by far Culture's best album ever. &quot;Bitter Belly&quot; Joseph Hill's voice never sounded better. I am a really Reggae expert - and believe me everyone who likes Reggae loves &quot;Wings Of A Dove&quot;. Everyone who doesn't like &quot;Wings Of A Dove&quot; is not a true Reggae fan. The best tracks on this CD are &quot;Freedom Time&quot;, &quot;Marriage In Canaan&quot; and of course &quot;Wings Of A Dove&quot;. So check the album. Joseph Hill has struggled to find his footing for the close to 20 years since he split up his classic Culture lineup that produced the amazing &quot;Two Sevens Clash,&quot; and &quot;Africa Stand Alone&quot; lps.During these years, the revamped culture lineups have released lps of varying quality, with &quot;One Stone&quot; being the best release in years. &quot;Wings of a Dove,&quot; while having good tracks, seems to me to be overproduced and too slick for my tastes. the over polished feel takes away from Culture's overall effect.A fair lp, there are better to be had. Culture's song wings of a dove when I first listen to, inspired me of how life on earth is really worthless than that life we could live spiritually deep down home where I could not be bothered or waken to peruse the sort of live in cities where you are kept on chasing money to survive while him the slave driver keeps on milking your energy by working for him but never get satisfied then I wish I had those Wings of a Dove to fly away home where Jah calls his children Zion.I believe Culture displayed Reggae as dynamic not just a music for fun and dance as some of us could think it is, but a medium for spreading the kingdom of Jah to come on earth through this song Wings of a Dove which in some cases signifies Peace on earth through ONE LOVE...","Reggae,World Music,Pop",absolutely love culture peaceful reggae good relax mood r p joseph hill eight culture seen times also avid reggae listener enthusiast love ranks one culture greatest works listen hot go buy culture able tour us often enjoy great live reggae fan cape coast minnesota since many release culture release best words really inspiring reggae fun buy never regret one favorite reggae cds easy ear rhythmic smooth unique vocals caught attention first enjoy reggae self favor buy one quot culture quot group million sounds joseph hill formerly quot african desciples quot famous voice found nowhere else absolutely love culture peaceful reggae good relax mood joseph hill hill culture seen times avid reggae listener enthusiast love ranks culture greatest greatest works works listen hot buy culture able tour enjoy great live reggae fan cape coast minnesota release culture release best words really inspiring reggae fun buy regret favorite reggae cds easy ear rhythmic smooth unique vocals caught attention enjoy reggae self favor buy culture quot group sounds joseph hill hill african quot famous voice found nowhere else

You can feel Dennis's pain in his voice on these  songs. Just as good if not better than any Bob Marley's album. I believe if  he got the right exposure he would not have been the Crowne Pince but yet  The King of reggae. A true. Another example of the fruitful time he spent with Joe Gibbs, Dennis  Brown's &quot;Visions&quot; is considered by many in reggae circles to be  his finest acheievement. It is hard to argue this point, as his soulful  voice was reaching its peak of maturity, as well his level of  songwriting.Anchored by the amazing tracks &quot;Stay at Home,&quot;  &quot;Malcolm X,&quot; and &quot;Jah Can Do It,&quot; Brown's uncanny  balance of love and message songs create a perfect balance on this album  that he rarely matched.This album is a classic, and no good reggae  collection can be without it.","Reggae,Dance Hall,World Music,Pop",favorite dennis brown cd dennis early made gem lyrics voice mature weak moment feel denniss pain voice good better bob marleys believe got right exposure would crowne pince yet king reggae true another example fruitful time spent joe gibbs dennis browns quot visions quot considered many reggae circles finest acheievement hard argue point soulful voice reaching peak maturity well level songwriting anchored amazing quot stay home quot quot malcolm x quot quot jah quot browns uncanny balance love message create perfect balance rarely matched classic good reggae collection without favorite dennis dennis brown brown cd dennis early gem lyrics voice mature weak moment feel pain voice good better bob bob marleys marleys believe got right exposure pince king reggae true example fruitful time spent joe joe gibbs gibbs dennis browns browns visions considered circles hard argue point soulful voice reaching maturity level anchored amazing stay home quot quot malcolm malcolm x quot quot jah quot browns uncanny balance love love message message create perfect perfect balance balance rarely matched classic good reggae collection
449,865,B000000DXN,"Hmmm.. Yellowman as the &quot;anti-Bob&quot; who began reggae's nosedive into sex and drum machines? Well, it's true that dancehall is to reggae what gangsta rap is to classic soul and R&amp;b,and Peter Tsoh in particular spoke out against Yellowman and his contemporaries. but Yellow man was clearly the best of that genre. Songs here like &quot;Shorties&quot;, Operation Eradication&quot; (see if you can stop singing this to yourself after hearing it) and my favorite &quot;Lover's Corner,&quot; which takes his chanting style to new heights, have a jivey charm and apppeal far beyond the jabbering jackasses that came in Yellowman's wake. &quot;GREEEEAAT JAMAICAN KETCHUP!&quot; Pretty soon you too will be &quot;A mad ovah him.&quot; I lost the LP in a move.  I really appreciate the fast shipment of the CD.  You will definitely have my businees in the future. This 1983 release (reissued on CD by Shanachie Records in 1989) was the album that truly made Yellowman a superstar. The all-time classics ""11+11"", ""Shorties"", ""Them a Mad Over Me"", ""Operation Eradication"" and the mellow ""Lover's Corner"" all make this CD a must-have for any true Yellowman fan. As is well-documented, Yellowman influenced such superstar 1980s Hip-Hop legends as RUN-D.M.C., Kurtis Blow and others and this album proves just why this was so. This album was released in 1982 as a 10&quot; under the title &quot;Operation Eradication.&quot;  This album helped propel Yellowman from the Jamaican club scene to a headliner at the 1982 Reggae Sunsplash.  &quot;One in A Million&quot; as renamed by Shanachie in 1989 helped change the face of reggae from &quot;roots and culture&quot; to a new dancehall style.  The influence from tracks &quot;Couchie&quot; and &quot;Operation Eradication&quot; can be heard in music today and other tracks such as &quot;shorties&quot; are pure classic Yellowman.  This album is a must have. Yellowman mashes it up in this excellent album.  It is definitely one of his best.  It features his early Toasting/DJ style and he reminds us that in his prime there was nobody better.  You can't miss with this album.

This CD has nothing less than great music, including one of my favorite reggae songs of all times: Lonesome Feeling, by Bob Marley. This is my childhood! I grew up listening to this entire album. From beginning with Dreamland to I got to go back home are all classics for generations to enjoy for years and years! This was Marcia's best album ever and is correctly regarded by many as a reggae masterpiece. Marcia is truly talented and deserves far more recognition. Some of these songs bridge the gap between reggae and smooth soul- if you are a fan of either genre, you really need to get this CD (you won't be disappointed). This pleasant album kicks off with a lovely version of Dreamland and winds its way through bubbly little ditties like Mark My Word, Feel Like Jumping and Melody Life. Her version of Bob Marley's Lonesome Feeling is moving and soulful, as is the uplifting Survival. I've Got To Go Back Home is atypical with its soulful spoken intro and her soaring vocals alternating with slower passages.

453,871,B000000DYU,"Ok, think Bob Marley can get raw with uncompromising lyrics? Think you can't get any mroe biting than the ""Stepping Razor"" Peter Tosh? Give Muta a listen and prepare to be shocked. Muta goes were few Reggae artists dare tread.""The People's Court Part 1 and 2"" are probably the most controversial reggae records of all time. Banned from Radio Irie (and I'm sure elsewhere in of Jamaica), these songs (actually skits set to music) are based on Prince Buster's ""Judge Dread"" ska skits of the 60s in which the judge let the rude bwais have it for terrorizing their own people.This time, Judge Muta takes on savage parodies of Jamaican prime ministers Edward Seaga and Michael Manley for ""selling out Black people."" He stops short of hanging them and sentences them to 1,000 years and suggesting they read the writings of Marcus Garvey. Getting the full gist of this requires some knowledge of Jamaican history and politcs. Not so for the even more biting part 2. Here, he takes on Western religion, the Mormon church, cultural imperialism, and fake preachers (with a choir eerily chanting ""Whiter than snow.""). He even suggests the preachers read the Egyptian Book of the Dead (If you don't know, do your research)! I don't think any American station (aside from podcasts) would touch this with a 49 1/2 foot pole either!This set even includes, ""It No Good to Live in a White Man's Country Too Long."" This guy doesn't play. ""Great Kings of Africa"" is a pretty accurate listing of achievements by said individuals.If you like your music raw and uncompromising, then this is for you. The devoutly religious and the faint of heart will want to keep some tabs of tylenol nearby for this one or leave it alone. Whether you agree with this or not, it's pretty imaginative, thought provoking, and powerful. This is a entery mostly to pay my respect to this man. And I love the  music, lyrics.. I can not say how much.. Dis poem;; OH MON!! Soooo, here I  go; RESPECT TO MUTABARUKA!!!! Mutabaruka is just another captalist trying to appeal as a great poet. His first LP &quot;Outcry!&quot; is the only one worth getting. Muta  is an old blowhard who lost his viability in the real reggae community years ago. I live in NY where reggae is alive and Muta couldn't draw a crowd here for a stage show and he knows it. The one star I gave is for the appearances of Luciano and Dennis Brown - true reggae greats. If you want to buy a reggae CD, I suggest you look to thier recorded outputs. Muta'a type of recording far exceeds the average person who gravitate towards listening to reggae. For one to really comprehend his calibre music, (dup-poet)one has to have a grasp of one's consciousness that surround a given culture (reggae,and not just the rythym or sounds of instrument) toppled with pain and suffering. Muta often rhetorate the historical hurt that was and still being inflicted upon the inhabitants of the Island. When one listened, one listens to the beat or rithym of the music as oppposed to the words. Muta's extreme consciousness of his surrounding and his people propelled him into a stateof higher realm thus, earn him the liberty to voice.......dub-poet. hey mon,Muta has been around fe long time and him a prophet from Jah.His lyrics are very inspirational and true.get one of him CDs fe can boost ya spirits. Mutabaruka is not your everyday mainstream reggae artist as he is more of a Rasta poet. This is not a bad thing especially since his poetry is laid over some very powerful and great sounding reggae riddims. I personnally love the people's court I and II and I Am De Man. All other tracks here are very good as well. Bun Dung Babylon is another powerful track with a haunting, deep chanting sound; also a favorite.Again do not buy this thinking you are getting some cool sounding Marley style singing reggae. Muta is a pro-black militant poet with a strong message to send to his listeners.You probably will not hear this in your local reggae club or dance hall, but it is great music and great poetry nevertheless. I recommend to those of you who enjoy creative deep thinking conscious poetry laid over very cool uplifting reggae. Muta is very in your face with his message, but I like the boldness he displays.I find it hard NOT to recommend this. I say give it a try and appreciate it for what it is. I think you will be happy you did. then come back and do a better job of reviewing it than I did.Peace and Love!","Reggae,World Music,Pop",ok think bob marley get raw uncompromising lyrics think cant get mroe biting stepping razor peter tosh give muta listen prepare shocked muta goes reggae artists dare tread peoples court part probably controversial reggae records time banned radio irie im sure elsewhere jamaica actually skits set based prince busters judge dread ska skits judge let rude bwais terrorizing people time judge muta takes savage parodies jamaican prime ministers edward seaga michael manley selling black people stops short hanging sentences years suggesting read writings marcus garvey getting full gist requires knowledge jamaican history politcs even biting part takes western religion mormon church cultural imperialism fake think bob bob marley raw lyrics think biting stepping stepping razor razor peter peter tosh tosh muta listen prepare shocked muta reggae artists dare tread peoples court probably controversial reggae records time banned radio irie im sure jamaica actually skits set based prince prince busters busters judge judge dread dread ska skits judge let rude terrorizing people time judge muta savage parodies jamaican jamaican prime ministers prime prime ministers ministers michael michael manley manley selling black black people people stops stops short short hanging sentences years suggesting read writings marcus garvey garvey full gist requires knowledge jamaican jamaican history history biting western western religion religion mormon mormon church church cultural cultural imperialism imperialism fake
454,873,B000000DZ9,"Besides one or two nice tracks and four or five hideous tracks, this album is rather boring. Most of this stuff is coming from Watty Burnett (I beleive) who sang with the Congos (now that's good music!) Don't be tricked  into thinking this will be as good. This is a dub classic. For anyone who is thinking of buying this, I highly recommend it.  However, the title and cover might be misleading for some people.  Most of these songs were written by Watty Burnett(member of the top-ranking harmony group The Congos) in the 1970's.  This album is a dub version of many of those rare singles mixed by Lee 'Scratch' Perry, King Tubby, and Phillip Smart.  All songs are mixed by one or the other. In other words the three were not working together on this material.  If you are a fan of traditional dub from the 70's you will enjoy this album.  I'm guessing all of the low ratings of this album come from the confussion of the title. Half this cd is Perry, half is King Tubby..no, the 2 are not working together on this disc...The tracks are decent, but the misleading of the fan into thinking Perry and Tubby are working together is wrong!The connection between the 2 is Congo's singer Watty Burnett, who recorded with both Perry and the King.Do not be fooled by the cover- the cd is Burnett recording with Perry, Burnett recording with Tubby, but none of the tracks feature Tubby and Perry working together.","Reggae,Dub,World Music,Pop",besides one two nice four five hideous rather boring stuff coming watty burnett beleive sang congos thats good dont tricked thinking good dub classic anyone thinking buying highly recommend however title cover might misleading people written watty burnett member top ranking harmony group congos dub version many rare singles mixed lee scratch perry king tubby phillip smart mixed one words three working together material fan traditional dub enjoy im guessing low ratings come confussion title half cd perry half king tubby working together disc decent nice hideous boring stuff coming watty burnett sang congos good dont tricked thinking good dub classic thinking buying highly recommend cover misleading people written watty burnett member ranking harmony group congos dub dub version version rare singles mixed lee scratch perry scratch scratch perry king king tubby phillip smart smart mixed words working material fan traditional dub enjoy guessing low ratings come title half cd half king king tubby working disc decent
455,874,B000000DZC,"if your a reggae fan, and by that i dont mean your into Bob Marley. if your a true reggae fan, then you'll love this album.if your into some Bob Marley and your looking for something else to add to your collection, then this album is a must have.this album is seriously TUFF. proper riddims, with some very nice vocals over the top.i can not recommend this album enough.when youve had a hard day at work, and you want something to relax to, this is it, put it on, sit back, and marvel at what is one of the most classic reggae albums of all time.JAH-RASTAFARI! A good record overall. A little bit commercial for my taste, but still good. Better than much of the rest of their catalog. Unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide, and fortified roots reggae album! If you don't have Firehouse Rock in your CD collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan, you may need to re-evaluate what you think you know about Jamaican music. The Roots Radics, especially the rythym section, utilize (with supreme efficacy, I might add) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae ""riddims."" On top of the Radics, the Wailing Souls add ethereal vocals, while staying masterfully conscious. Firehouse Rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible Jamaican history and an absolute must have. MY FIRST LISTEN WAS IN THE EARLY 90'S ON LP, I TREASURE THIS ALBUM AS IT IS A CLASSIC. STAY CLOSE TO YOUR SOUL AS KINGDOMS DO RISE AND FALL, LOOK AT WORLD HISTORY AND YOU WILL SEE THAT ALL GREAT COUNTRIES MUST BE JUDGED. AMERICA WAKE UP!GIVE THANKS AND PRAISE TO YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER AS HIS SPIRIT MAKES THIS MUSIC POSSIBLE.IF YOU LIKE THIS ALBUM, THE ABBYSINNIAN'S SATTA MASSAGANA WILL BLOW YOUR MIND, AS IT IS TRUE PRAISE AND WORSHIP IN A REGGAE ROOTS FORMAT. Wailing Souls have a familiar reggae vocal group sound, fairly simple harmonies, a single lead mostly. Strong vocal hooks and good horn parts but what I think tip this one over the edge are the cutting edge rhythms. Rockers and Steppers beats from Roots Radics (and I'm more of a Sly &Robbie fan myself) are absolutely crucial and tight. Some of them on the slow side. This record is a historical span between the 1st and 2nd eras in reggae. This one is recorded and mixed very well for the era...too many of these roots records are a bit dull. You might recognize some of these tracks from the seminal Scientist &#34;...Vampires...&#34; dub album. Firehouse Rock, Act of Affection, Who Lives It and See Baba Joe are the best tracks. The urgency of the message about peace, love and understanding are what the Wailing Souls' lamentations are about.  They are appealing to you to know yourself: stop and think.  They come from a place (Jamaica) created from suffering, through their ancestors voices in slavery, their haunted souls scream for justice, truth and rights everywhere.  I feel their pain, I feel their (my) liberation and healing acknowledging all is not fixed.  Buy this music to practice, through movement, a healing in your heart -- you just won't be able to keep still.  Thank you. Simple equation: Junjo + Roots Radics + Wailing Souls = One of the finest  reggae albums ever produced.  The Wailing Souls sounds so harmonious in  this album.  They sing over often used Roots Radics/Junjo Lawes rhythms  which should be instantly recognizable to fans of reggae who listen to this  great album.  This is definitely an album to have in any reggae collection. think that sounds extreme?  try again....  every note on this album rings true-- every sound, every harmonic convergence works. This is by so far their best work that it is hard to consider &quot;Wild Suspence&quot; (their so-called debut album featuring Bredda Gravalicious and the woefully under-praised Row Fisherman Row) as even in the same ball park (though Wild Suspense is good).Firehouse Rock is quite simply some of the best music you will ever hear.  I say that as a fan of all genres-- while typing this I am listening to the re-mix of the Duke's &quot;Live at Newport&quot;-- I am a huge fan of hip-hop, rock, roots, R&amp;B, classical-- and yet, if I were to be stranded on a desert isle &quot;Firehouse Rock&quot; would be one of the few albums I would need.  Need I say more?  The timid will shy away-- the righteous will buy this album! tp","Reggae,Jamaica,Dub,Dance Hall,Pop,World Music,Caribbean & Cuba",reggae fan dont mean bob marley true reggae fan youll love bob marley looking something else add collection must seriously tuff proper riddims nice vocals top recommend enough youve hard day work want something relax put sit back marvel one classic reggae time jah rastafari good record overall little bit commercial taste still good better much rest catalog unbelievably indubitably bona fide fortified roots reggae dont firehouse rock cd collection consider reggae fan may need evaluate think know jamaican roots radics especially rythym section utilize supreme efficacy might add reggae fan mean bob bob marley true reggae fan love bob bob marley looking add collection seriously proper riddims nice vocals recommend hard hard day day work want relax sit sit back marvel classic reggae time jah jah rastafari rastafari good record overall little bit bit commercial taste good better rest catalog unbelievably indubitably fortified roots roots reggae firehouse rock cd collection consider reggae fan need evaluate think know jamaican roots roots radics especially section utilize supreme efficacy add

King Yellow's infectious rhythms and intelligent (and often very funny) lyrics had me hooked from the start. This is a great CD to introduce anybody to this great artist, including hit songs such as Mr. Chin, Two To Six Supermix, and Natty Sat Upon A Rock, which often find their way into his live repertoire. All fans of reggae or people that like upbeat and groovy tunes need to check this one out! Yellowman has recorded many albums of the past 30 or so years, but ""Mister Yellowman"" stands out among all the rest as his strongest recording of his career. This album showcases every side of Yellowman's personality: we see his humor in songs like ""Cocky Did A Hurt Me"", his social/political side in ""Duppy of Gunman"", his sexual side in ""Morning Ride"", and his romantic side in ""Yellowman Getting Married"". All the songs on the album are great, especially my personal favorite, ""Jamaica A Little Miami"". Roots Reggae fans may find it hard to really get into this album, but if you love Reggae music, Dancehall Reggae, and King Yellowman, then you will love this classic CD. Not a bad Yellowman CD. I really like some of the tracks but some I don't need to hear. I love almost all reggae music. The music is good however some of the songs on this cd are a little dirty. Not appropriate for all listeners. Originally released in 1982, this album was the one that truly made Yellowman a superstar. ""Lost Mi Love"", ""Jamaica A Little Miami"", ""Mr. Chin"" and ""Two To Six Supermix"" were all hige dancehall hits that helped make Yellowman the top toaster/DJ in Jamaica during his 1981-1988 reign as the king of Dancehall music in Jamaica. Well over 30 years after its original release ""Mister Yellowman"" remains one of the freshest and most iconic Dancehall albums ever made. Yellowman+Roots Radics=classic  CLassic old school dancehall from King Yellow. This is  a crucial CD. Just that. I've had &#34;King Yellowman&#34; for the longest time, and have never heard any of his other tracks. This CD started out great and gets better every time I listen to it. This is a great Yellowman CD.  It's one of his early works and definitely one of his best.  This is a must for all reggae fans.  From the catchy Mr. Chin, to the non-stop style of Natty Sat Up On The Rock, to the deep bass  sound of Duppy or Gunman.  This entire CD is fantastic! WoW!!

After recording the critically acclaimed but poor-selling &#34;King Yellowman&#34; album for Columbia Records in 1984, Yellowman returned to his original recording home at Greensleeves Records and released this album which was produced by his long-time producer Henry &#34;Junjo&#34; Lawes and brought him back to familiar territory. If it is true that &#34;Nobody Move&#34; was no &#34;Mister Yellowman&#34; then it is also true that it scored more hits for Yellowman and helped further his reputation as the undisputed king of Jamaica's dancehall music scene. Enjoy! If you like Reggae, you'll love Yellowman. I love listening to this while I'm stuck in traffic.

461,881,B000000DZU,"really love the tunes here.  some of the best i've heard from the souls.  only problem would be some background noise on a few tracks.  not too bad though, almost adds to the vibe.  -peace I love this cd because is group(The Wailing Soul) is very much underrated. They are in the class as the mighty diamond and culture. wicked bass playing through out and especially on joy within your heart. The Wailing Souls have a lot in common  with Bob Marley. First they are  from the infamous ghetto Trenchtown. Second their lead singer Winston  &quot;Pipes&quot; Matthews was too a pupil of Joe Higgs. Lastely, they  produced some of the most heartfelt reggae of the 70's.  This best of  collection covers the Wailing Souls work from the 70's throught the mid  80's. Some classics here are &quot;War&quot; &quot;Bredda Gravalicous&quot;  and &quot;Fire House Rock&quot;. Besideds those songs ALL the other songs  are solid as well. While The Wailing Souls prime was in the 70's they are  still making great music in the current time. They just released Equality  which is another good choice. This disc pays for itself after the first few tracks. Really nice vocals and instrumentation, great roots reggae! Jah Give us Life and Bredda Gravalicious are worth the price of admission alone. The rest of the disc is great to. It has a real smooth Dub feel to it which complements the relaxed yet passionate vocals. Highly reccomended. ..I don't lile too much of collections , but this cd is stream cool , wailing souls are one of my favorites reggae roots band , this sound and lirics are extremally calm and peaceful , praising always to the most sky Jah....If you like roots music , this cd are for you....","Reggae,Dub,Dance Hall,World Music,Pop",really love tunes best ive heard souls problem would background noise bad though almost adds vibe peace love cd group wailing soul much underrated class mighty diamond culture wicked bass playing especially joy within heart wailing souls lot common bob marley first infamous ghetto trenchtown second lead singer winston quot pipes quot matthews pupil joe higgs lastely produced heartfelt reggae best collection covers wailing souls work throught mid classics quot war quot quot bredda gravalicous quot quot fire house rock quot besideds solid well wailing souls prime still making great current time released equality really love tunes best heard souls problem background background noise noise bad adds vibe peace love cd group wailing wailing soul soul underrated class mighty diamond culture wicked bass playing especially joy heart wailing wailing souls souls common bob bob marley infamous ghetto trenchtown second second lead lead lead singer singer winston quot pipes matthews pupil joe joe higgs higgs produced heartfelt reggae best collection covers wailing wailing souls souls work mid classics war quot quot bredda quot quot fire fire house house rock quot solid wailing wailing souls souls prime great current time time released released equality
462,882,B000000DZW,"I loved my recent trip to Ireland and had missed the pub music.  This CD was wonderful and very evocative of my time there.  I especially love the piece &#34;All God's Children Have A Place in the Choir.&#34; and played this during our annual pet blessing on St. Patrick's Day.  Everyone loved singing along. I bought this cd specifically for the &#34;Gentle Annie&#34; song which I really like but I enjory all the other songs as well. An excellent selection of traditional music classics by Makem and Clancy which will delight all ages. One of the best renditions of The Band Played Waltzing Matilda I have heard. A timeless classic. This group has long brought us the songs of Ireland - both sides.  And they continue to do it well. LIAM CLANCY HAS JUST RECENTLY STUMBLED INTO MY KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE FOLK MUSIC, ALTHOUGH MOST OF IT IS ANTI-WAR/ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT SONGS, THEY CERTIANLY RING TRUE AND CONVEY THE FEELINGS OF A PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER BRITISH RULE FOR MUCH TOO LONG.BEING A GREAT GRANDSON OF AN ALABAMA TROOPER WHO SURVIVED THEFILTHY BLOOD MILLS WHICH SERVED AS YANKEE &#34;HOSPITALS&#34;.  tHEY SURVIVED BY GOING AWOL FROM THE &#34;HOSPITALS&#34;. Some years ago I was in Killarney trying to learn some english when we start talking about irish music. I told my teacher I was bored of false elf-like music of never working people all day singing in beautiful valleys with a lot of (digital) echo.Next day he gave me a CD copy (i'm sorry) of this album. Since then I think this, with the earlier Chieftains albums, is one of the best irish music I have.But I'm spanish so my opinion may be of no interest. This is really a wonderful collection of Tommy and Liam together. If you never had the chance to see two giants in Irish music, then this CD will provide a glimse of what it may have been like. A terrific mix of ballads and traditonal irish songs. Their unique musical talents and signing compliments each other and each song. If you are undecided as to buy a CD from Tommy or Liam, this CD is definately the one to go with. This music is a collection of heart-felt songs.  There is joy and sadness, delight and despair ... the entire range of feelings ... but mostly there is ... fun ... when listening to ""The Makem & Clancy Collection"".These numbers are not just a lot of slick productions ... with their impersonal lyrics and assembly-line melodies.  They are (to me) music at its most down-to-earth and its most enjoyable.""A Place in the Choir"" starts things off, and we're led to believe that ... what is to follow will be a standard, harmless series of Irish ballads ... but, the very next song ... ""The Cobbler"" let's us in on the truth ... and we are taken into the heart of the Makem/Clancy appeal ... the deeply held opinions and feelings of men who care about people.""The Dutchman"" is a beautiful and touching ballad about a simple man and his loving wife.  ""Willie McBride"" is an anti-war statement ... and an effective one.  ""Morning Glory"" is a rousing song with a funny twist.  ""Ballad of St. Anne's Reel"" is a nice song about a traveller.  ""Gentle Annie"" is a heart-felt tribute to, well, Annie.  ""Rambles of Spring"" is an appropriately fun and rollicking song to end the CD (tape) with ... but the gem of the collection is ""The Band Played Waltzing Matilda"".  It sort-of has to catch a hold of you (before you will think it's special), but once it does, you are very much taken by the story and they effective way it is sung.Some of these songs were recorded live ... the CD is a nice mixture of live and studio recorded music ... and the audience clearly has a deep affection for these boys ... as is easy to understand.But this CD would make a nice gift ... here is some real music ... as perhaps music was intended to be played. I just love this album. I love this album.  It is loaded with all great songs and I just neede to augment my vinyl collection with a more portable medium.  I highly reccommend it, particularly since the last of this entire band passed away last year. You either love this kind of music or you don't. These guys are classic musicians of this genre and I loved this album. Good quality recordings of songs that are excellent of their type. I bought to primarily to learn two of the songs, and loved almost all of them. They are the best, a little floksy but great voices and authentic Celtic sound. Can listen over and over without tiring. I've listened to this album since childhood, and it is probably the most treasured CD in my collection.  In particular, &quot;The Ballad of St. Anne's Reel&quot;, &quot;Four Green Fields&quot;, &quot;Willie McBride&quot;, and &quot;The Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; stand out.  A must have for any Folk and/or Irish music fan. Hard to find Tom Makem songs that she wanted...she was so happy!She said it reminded her of Papa, so sweet.P.S. I love it too! This is one of the best of the &quot;Clancy Brothers, Tommy Makem, all as a group, some solo albums, some with just two singers, some with moms, grandmas and kids&quot; genre. There are now so many &quot;Clancy/Makem&quot; collections, collaborations, compilations and re-issues of original LP's that it is hard to keep everything straight. This one is just Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem getting lucky and putting out an album in the late 1980's that combined wacky fun and bitter protest and made both succeed. &quot;A Place in the Choir&quot; and &quot;The Garden Song&quot; are bright, brief offerings worth the purchase price all by themselves. But then you get &quot;The Dutchman&quot; and &quot;The Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; and my favorite of the bitter anti-war songs, &quot;Willie McBride&quot; as well! Everything on this one is listenable, but half are brilliant. If you already like these guys, add this item to the collection. If you want a good introduction to the world of Clancy/Makem, one that shows the innocence as well as the somber side of things Irish, you cannot go wrong buying this CD.","Europe,Irish Folk,Ireland,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,Britain,World Music,Folk",loved recent trip ireland missed pub cd wonderful evocative time especially love piece gods children place choir played annual pet blessing st patricks day everyone loved singing along bought cd specifically gentle annie really like enjory well excellent selection traditional classics makem clancy delight ages one best renditions band played waltzing matilda heard timeless classic group long brought us ireland sides continue well liam clancy recently stumbled knowledge true folk although anti war anti establishment certianly ring true convey feelings people british rule much long great grandson alabama trooper survived loved recent trip missed pub cd wonderful evocative time especially love love piece piece gods gods children children place choir played annual pet blessing st patricks st patricks day day loved singing singing along bought cd specifically gentle gentle annie really excellent selection traditional classics clancy delight ages best renditions band played waltzing waltzing matilda heard timeless classic group long brought sides continue liam clancy clancy recently stumbled knowledge true folk anti anti war war anti establishment ring ring true true convey feelings people british british rule rule long great great grandson grandson trooper survived

464,884,B000000E0E,"As a long time fan of a two generations of the Clancy/Makem recordings, I hate to say ""this is as good as it gets"" again.  But this is as good as it gets!This is a mature Makem and Clancy. Comparing ""Peg Leg Jack"" with ""Golden"" gives a good idea of Makem's vocal range.In the same way  ""Parcel of Rogues"" with ""Fair and Tender Ladies"" gives us an idea of what Clancy can do with his voice.""We've Come a Long Way"" ,  written by Makem, I believe, gives a window into their long friendship and intertwined careers. It is a good humored, upbeat song.  You get the idea that they like each other, or, at least, they fake it real well.They do a wonderful frog love song: ""Frog in the Well""; 2 boat songs:  ""Queen of Connemarra"" [a melodic love song to a boat], The Mary Ellen Carter"" [an inspiational boat song];  a powerful work song:  ""Drill Ye Tarriers Drill.  A highway man song, a couple of love songs, Clancy singing in Irish round the thing out.The arrangements and back up are superb.  Read the credits and you will see why.As usual their baritone voices play off one another beautifully and when they sing together, they sing as one. Released in 1987, this is the final recording made by Liam Clancey and Tommy Makem before the duo split up. It's also by far the most interesting musically, and at least some of the credit goes to producer/musician/arranger extraordinaire Donal Lunny.Lunny, who's worked with just about everybody in the Irish music world, contributed bouzoukis, bodhrans and keyboards to the 13 songs. He also did much of the arranging, so much of We've Come A Long Way has more variety than previous M&amp;C recordings. Indeed, maybe there was too much variety for Makem. I interviewed him in the mid 1990s and when I mentioned how much I enjoyed this recording, he didn't have much to say. Perhaps it's no surprise, since he apparently didn't contribute any of his trademark tin whistle or banjo to the musical menu.Still, you'll be blown away by the silky, elegant ballads Roseville Fair, Golden and Queen of Connemara. Frog In The Well is a fun Clancey Brothers &amp; Tommy Makem standard redone here, and The Mary Ellen Carter is a feisty treatment of a folk classic by the late Canadian troubadour Stan Rogers.All in all, I'd say Makem and Clancey finished with their strongest recording. As a big fan, I think that the only one of Tommy's Makem's records better than this is ""Songbag"" which is very special in making old and overly-familiar music quite fresh and moving. This one has brought hours of pleasure to our whole family. Choice cut - The Queen of Connemara"". What a great CD.  If you are fans of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem this is a great album to add to your collection.  These two are great on their own but together they can't be beat.  Too bad they are no longer with us.  They are the best. GOLDEN is the last song on this album, and that's what the album is.  If you've never heard Makem and Clancy (Liam) you'll love the way their voices and music blend. Included in this album are old folk standards, FROG IN THE WELL,  DRILL, YE TARRIERS, DRILL, and THE HIGHWAYMAN. All sung with an  Irish lilt.  There's Irish history in ROSEVILLE FAIR, and PARCEL OF ROGUES and  comedy in PEG LEG JACK.  But the highlights are the amazingly soft and tender love ballads, FAIR AND TENDER LADIES, and GOLDEN.  THE COAST OF MALABAR is the eternal story of a sailor who falls in love with a girl on the other side of the world, but must leave her when duty calls.  Last, but by no means least, THE QUEEN OF CONNEMARA is a love song from a sailor to his boat, and THE MARY ELLEN CARTER is an ode  from the crew to a sunken ship. I was 6 years old when my parents took my sister and I to Makem & Clancy's final concert in Boston.  We loved the show so much that afterwards we bought this album and two of their solo efforts (on cassette!).  ""We've Come a Long Way"" quickly became our family favorite, and we played ""The Mary Ellen Carter"" so many times that the tape is now worn out.  When I found out that Amazon had the album on CD I quickly bought a copy for myself and one for my parents.  These are the songs of my childhood; beautiful, funny, and inspirational.  HIGHLY recommended for any lover of Irish folk music.","Europe,Irish Folk,Ireland,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,Britain,World Music,Folk",long time fan two generations clancy makem recordings hate say good gets good gets mature makem clancy comparing peg leg jack golden gives good idea makems vocal range way parcel rogues fair tender ladies gives us idea clancy voice weve come long way written makem believe gives window long friendship intertwined careers good humored upbeat get idea like least fake real well wonderful frog love frog well boat queen connemarra melodic love boat mary ellen carter inspiational boat powerful work drill ye tarriers drill highway man couple love clancy singing irish round thing arrangements back superb read credits see usual baritone voices p long long time time fan generations recordings hate say good good mature clancy comparing peg peg leg leg jack golden good good idea idea vocal vocal range range way parcel rogues fair tender ladies idea clancy voice come long way written believe window long friendship intertwined careers good humored upbeat idea fake real wonderful frog love frog boat queen melodic love love boat boat mary mary ellen carter ellen ellen carter carter boat powerful work drill tarriers drill highway man couple love clancy singing irish round arrangements superb read credits see usual baritone baritone voices voices
465,886,B000000E1C,"This is a group that used to play in New York, Boston, Halifax, etc. I was a great fan of their live performances. I owned their albums in vinyl. Thankful that this is finally offered in Audio CD format. Haven't thought of them in a while, but happy to have their music once again. I have seen Barley Bree perform live and truly enjoyed them, so collected all of their recordings.  The fact that Tom and Jimmy Sweeney are Tommy Makem's nephews also influenced the purchases.  In my opinion though, the songs get a bit monotonous to listen to.  I have hundreds of Celtic music recordings, and while this is by no means the worst, it is not among my most listened to.  There are some good songs on the recording, so if you have no other Barley Bree recordings, you may want to give it a shot.  However, if you already have any of their recordings, unless you want more of the same, skip this one. You can't beat the originals of the early Irish folk scene!!  Brings back some lovely memories!! Brilliant bunch of musicians. I love this CD...but since the Sweeney brothers are my cousin i guess it is probably a little partial...but never the less the CD is great! The songs are classic, and Tom Sweeney still performs in the US, you just need to keep your eye out for him. This album is an absolute favorite of mine. As a child no car trip was complete with out playing various Cassette tapes of Barley Bree. I know the recording so well I start the next tune or song before it comes through the speakers.

466,887,B000000E1R,"If you like music to settle the nerves this is an excellent way to unravel. I have listened to this CD often and never tired of it. I have enjoyed selections from this CD for some time on Pandora and finally purchased it! It is as wonderful as I expected. I first heard Phil Coulter's ""Sea of Tranquility"" in Belfast, N. Ireland in 1996 while on a motorcoach. The music is so haunting and so impeccably performed by such genius. I bought the music on audio tape in Kilkenny while still visiting Ireland. It was not available on CD in that store. Upon returning home I received the CD as a gift. I believe that my two favourite songs on the album are ""Cliffs of Dooneen"" and ""Tranquility"". Mr. Coulter has a way of putting you into the songs he creates. He lets you feel like you are part of Ireland. I still haven't figured out what instrument he uses in ""Tranquility"" at the very beginning of the song. I had the chance to ask him, but I forgot to! This album will amaze you, and let you feel that you are part of the Irish landscape. Colter is a master of celtic music.  Some of the offerings on this CD are familiar, some are not, but all are great quiet listening. As other reviewers have said, this is an extremely beautiful collection of relaxing music. Glad I ordered it. I'm sure I'll purchase other albums by this artist as well. I enjoy all of Phil Coulter's music.  I have several albums and what I listen to most often in the car.  Great orchestra. I recently purchased this album along with &#34;Serenity&#34; and &#34;Highland Cathedral&#34;.The sound quality, song selection and performance are all excellent.I would recomend these CDs to anyone who appreciates great orchestra music. My wife brought me this from WalMart not knowing the artist.  I have fallen in love with it as have most of my family members, most of whom have gone out and bought their own copies of it.  I have just ordered three more of Phil Coulters releases and find that I love them all.  A GREAT ARTIST with great renditions! This music should come free with all new cars sold in America. It would positively end road rage forever. Phil Coulter's music uplifts, de-stresses, inspires, takes the sharp edges off the day and prepares you to face the challenges at the end of your drive, whichever direction you're going. I love it.

Phil Coulter's Irish music is relaxing and a joy to listen to.  We have other music of his and enjoy them also. Beautiful music from a gifted artist!  We have added that to our collection of fine Irish music.  We already own another of his cds. I have long been a fan of Phil Coulter's music and Sea of Tranquility is one of the best of his recordings. Phil Coulter has never dissappointed.  Have been pleased with all his CD's and DVD's.  If he is half as nice as he appears his music really does come from his heart. This music could be listened to for hours.  One of the most relaxing CD's I have heard in many many years.  Definitely well worth the money. A few years ago, my husband and I were sitting in pub in Killarney.Suddenly, this soft gentle simply beautiful music came on. Both of us were enchanted and the barmaid told us the name 0f this bewitching  album. We loved it and before we went home to Colorado, we had bought 3 or  4 more tapes.Since that time, we have bought every album he has put out. To  us, Phil Coulter is everything a genius leprechaun should be. Though I am  not so old I have told my family that his music is all I want at my funeral  someday.  He lulls, he soothes, he calms. He is amazing. When I bought this album, ""Sea of Tranquility"", I had not heard one single song on the album, so I was really buying hearing unheard.  When it arrived and I played it, I couldn't believe how truly beautiful all the songs were.  I now play it all the time, and even have an amusing story about it.  I was buying a speaker system for my MP3 player and brought my MP3 player with me so I could try out the different speakers.  Of course wanting to get full advantage of the speakers capabilities I did have the volume turned up kind of high.  After a few minutes I noticed several other customers and one or two of the clerks also listening.  They all thought the music was great and wanted to know who it was by, of course I told them the album was ""Sea of Tranquility"" by Phil Coulter and that I had purchased it from Amazon. Intend to buy more of his albums, until then, bye and talk to you later.  Lstickers I recently returned from Ireland where I heard this album.Very relaxing music and some in my company were playing itwhile being delayed in the airport.  Glad to find that itcould be purchased at Amazon.

467,888,B000000E1T,"I am so glad that I purchased this CD.  It is beautiful and has many songs that we don't hear that often. We discovered Phil Coulter on a trip to England four years ago. Since then, we have bought almost every one of his albums. This Christmas one is outstanding - wonderful background for a party or perfect just for listening. No one will regret their purchase of this fine album. This CD has the most beautiful selection of songs! Phil Coulter, as usual, truly is a most wonderful piano artist! Phil Coulter has always been a favorite of mine, especially since I lived in Ireland for five years back in the 1980s and have heard him in concert.  I would highly recommend tis album and other Phil Coulter albums. As always, Phil Coulter's music is beautifully orchestrated.  The Celtic styling is  wonderfully done.  I can almost see the beautiful isles that I love. I have many Christmas cds but this is positively my #1 favorite. I love this cd and play it so many times during the holidays. Weekend Classics White Christmas with Mantovani, Aldrich & Chacksfield is #2 and John McDermott's Christmas Memories is #3. Roger Whittaker's Christmas Album is next and Glenn Yarborough's Christmas with Glenn is next. I could list many more Christmas cds but you could not go far wrong with these. I love ""Phil Coulter's Christmas."" His fun and love of the music shines through. His arrangements are pure, and you don't get lost in the ""frills"" that a lot of artists throw in. As with all of his recordings, he knows exactly which instruments to use to bring out the full emotion and richness of the song. No wonder my other Christmas recordings have hardly made it off of the shelf this year!I have the 2-disc version called ""The Christmas Collection,"" which also includes ""Winter Wonderland,"" ""All Through The Night,"" ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,"" ""Fairytale of New York,"" ""Morning Has Broken,"" and ""We Three Kings."" While I would rather have ""Phil Coulter's Christmas"" than nothing at all, I have to say the additional six songs make the double CD version worth looking for, as they are some of the best songs. I will never tire of this CD - it is by far the best Christmas CD  of all times.  I have a lot of Christmas CD's - this one still gets played the most. I was visiting some friends a couple a weeks ago. There was some very music playing in the background; and when I asked them about it, I was informed I was listening to a CD by Phil Coulter. Since we were close to the holiday season, I decided to take a chance on his Christmas effort. After giving it a listen; I would put it in the category of &quot;pleasant, but not great.&quot; I say this as someone who already owns a couple of dozen Christmas CD's. For someone new to this area of music, they might enjoy this particular production. As for myself, I would have passed on this disc if I could have listened to it beforehand. I have bought this album several times over the years - I can't spend Christmas without it! This album provides a time of quiet peace in the midst of frantic holiday preparations. It will be a treasured addition to your music collection. I am a long-time fan of Phil Coulter.  This album was good, but I didn't care for the vocal selections -- I would rather have had it all wordless music. This is an excellent CD by an artist who never fails to give his best to the work he produces. This CD brings a peaceful, magical quality to listening to Christmas music. Well done. Another of my favorite Christmas collections, that I listen to every year when I put up my Christmas Tree.  A very soothing sound. This is a fantastic listening experience.It does drip, it can be a little schmaltzy...but, for Christmas time, that's all the better.I cherish this performance.It is rare and special.I'ts one slight step away from being new-agey, but, it's dreamyand takes you far away from your worries.I have hundreds of Christmas Lp's and Cd's.If I had to pick only one....Phil Coulter's Christmas would be it. I love Phil Coulter so much.His piano plays make me happy andsoothing.  His Christmas plays expresssilent holidays. After all the store jingling, mind jangling Christmas muzak faced on the malls and shops, the mad rushing crowds lined up waiting for cash registers and lines of traffic listening to this is a real treat.  How refreshing to chill out listening to this CD while wrapping presents or putting up Christmas decorations; it is not intrusive, so provides a wonderful background sound for conversation with friends and family at a time of year so important for gatherings.  Or enjoy it alone, allowing it to keep you company.","Noels,Irish Folk,Vocal Pop,Ireland,British Isles,Europe,British & Celtic Folk,Celtic New Age,Pop,Holiday & Wedding,New Age,Opera & Classical Vocal,World Music,Vocal Non-Opera,Christmas,Folk",glad purchased cd beautiful many dont hear often discovered phil coulter trip england four years ago since bought almost every one christmas one outstanding wonderful background party perfect listening one regret purchase fine cd beautiful selection phil coulter usual truly wonderful piano artist phil coulter always favorite mine especially since lived ireland five years back heard concert would highly recommend tis phil coulter always phil coulters beautifully orchestrated celtic styling wonderfully done almost see beautiful isles love many christmas cds positively favorite love cd play many times holidays weekend classics white christmas man glad purchased cd beautiful hear discovered phil phil coulter coulter trip years years ago bought christmas outstanding wonderful background party perfect listening regret purchase fine cd beautiful selection phil phil coulter coulter usual truly wonderful piano artist phil phil coulter coulter favorite mine especially lived ireland years heard concert highly recommend tis phil phil coulter coulter phil coulters coulters beautifully orchestrated celtic styling wonderfully see beautiful isles love christmas cds positively favorite love cd play times holidays weekend classics white christmas man
468,889,B000000E1V,"I was introduced to Phil Coulter via James Galway. Now I own several of his CD's. This one is a duplicate I will someday give it as a trade to a good friend who also loves Celtic musicMust recomend this to any Coulter fan or to anyone who wants to listen to very good Celtic music. I have all of Coulter's CDs. Each is better than the next.  I play them incessantly. Music is both very relaxing while still being quite rousing. Everyone should love all of his music. Very sentimental,  relaxing and most enjoyable, brings back lots of memoriesa nice addition to my Phil Coulter collection  thank you Phil Coulter is about as Irish as you can get.Born in Derry,Northern Ireland on February 19,1942.His father was one of the few Catholic cops on the Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary.His best known song,&#34;The Town I Loved So Well&#34; is about his home town ,Derry,and what terrible times it went through in the early 70's ,known as &#34;The Troubles&#34;.His was a musical family and he had 2 brothers and 1 sister.He is one of Ireland's most popular and loved musicians and songwriters.He has had 23 Platinum,39 Golden and 52 Silver albums.He has won innumerablel awards in Europe and America.His music is gentle,haunting,sentimental lighthearted,sad,and encompasses every personal emotion imaginable.Ireland has many,many songs about its troubles over the past 800 years and many rousing Rebel songs as well.However;Coulter's music is much gentler.Some of his music has vocals that will reach into your heart and soul;but he really excels with his piano playing.His music and songs are admired and sung by many other musicians.This collection of 16 tracks is all without vocals,except for ANNA LIVIA featuring Suzanne Murphy,one of Europe's leading sopranos and is supurb for background music.If you know Coulter's music;you can'tbut hear and feel the words of these songs while Coulter plays the music.The tracks on this album are a mixture of songs written by Coulter,traditional Irish songs and well known and loved songs by others.The album has a running time of about one hour.In this album,Phil Coulter uses his inimitable piano stylings to recreate a nostalgic world of days gone by...a world of dear hearts and gentle people,of timeless truths and simple pleasures;a world of unhurried days and cosy nights in the kitchen and songs in the parlor--a world of Forgotten Dreams.Whether it is traditional Irish songs such as THE MOUNTAINS OF MOURNE,I LOVED THE GROUND SHE WALKED UPON,orWHEN I GROW TOO OLD TO DREAM;this is an album you wil play over and over. Another very enjoyable CD from Phil. The feeling and expresson he puts into his music is outstanding. I love it. I think Phil Coulter is one of the most talented musicians and composers alive today. I own just about everything he has recorded, but found this one recently. It is hard to say which of his albums is best, but I put this one right up there with The Songs I Love So Well and Lake of Shadows.I have been to Derry, Northern Ireland, where Coulter was born, and he is a favorite son there. Having seen some of the places he writes about made his music even better for me. There is a Coulter style of piano, and I can pick out his playing if I hear it anywhere. This album sends me into a happy, contented place, without making me want to sleep.If you can only afford one album of this incredible guy, this is a great one to have. I just hope he comes to New Mexico sometime so I can see him live! Forgotten Dreams is a collection of music to soothe the worst sort of turmoil. It ought to be played in the prisons, I think.  It takes one back to another era, a time when life was good and sweet and we felt loved and a part of a great and gentle family.  'I Loved the Ground She Walked Upon' is a gripper. If it doesn't melt your heart....you're dead!  This is the CD I'd take onto a desert island if I could only take one.","Europe,Irish Folk,Ireland,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Celtic New Age,Pop,Easy Listening,New Age,Britain,World Music,Folk",introduced phil coulter via james galway several cds one duplicate someday give trade good friend also loves celtic musicmust recomend coulter fan anyone wants listen good celtic coulters cds better next play incessantly relaxing still quite rousing everyone love sentimental relaxing enjoyable brings back lots memoriesa nice addition phil coulter collection thank phil coulter irish get born derry northern ireland february father one catholic cops protestant royal ulster constabulary best known town loved well home town derry terrible times went early known troubles musical family brothers sister one irelands popu introduced phil coulter coulter james galway cds duplicate someday trade trade good good good friend friend loves celtic coulter fan wants listen good celtic coulters cds better play incessantly relaxing quite rousing love sentimental relaxing enjoyable brings brings back back lots lots nice addition phil coulter coulter collection thank phil coulter coulter irish born northern northern ireland ireland february father catholic cops protestant royal royal ulster constabulary ulster constabulary best known town loved home town terrible times early known troubles musical family brothers sister

472,893,B000000E2K,"Cheb Mami is, by far, the most intoxicating voice of Rai.  Each song enlivens the senses, and his vocal ability awakens my spirit.  The album is like a journey of the soul.  It is difficult to choose a favorite song  among this album.  But, if I did, it would have to be Ana Mazel. (Forgive  me if the spelling is incorrect.)  That piece exemplifies his soaring vocal  ability, and the soulfulness of the entire album.  My only sorrow is the  shortness of the album, and the scarcity of Rai music where I live.  Before  the internet, it was next to impossible to find such wonderful artists as  Cheb Mami (in the midwest).  If you love this album and Cheb Mami's other  works, as I do,I also recommend Cheb Khaled.  Although his voice is not as  vibrant as Mami, he, too, evokes the true spirit of Rai in every song.

473,894,B000000E2P,"I particularly liked Following Me, The fox and Shaking of the sheets.  The song shaking of the sheets I had to listen several times to decide if it was referring to a funeral shroud or sex between the sheets.  The fox is a classic viewpoint of teh fox hunt form teh foxes view.  Following me was just slightly creepy.  All in all a worthy addition By the 1980s, Steeleye Span had reformed but they were not nearly as prolific as they had been during their heyday.  &quot;Tempted and Tried&quot; was released near the dawn of the 90s and demonstrates an older, wiser Steeleye, more mellow than most of its predecessors and an album that can appeal to even the more folk-rock phobic in the audience.  True, there is a price to pay for instant appeal - the hard driving quality of &quot;Parcel of Rogues&quot; and &quot;All Around My Hat&quot; is sadly missing and the whole thing comes across as slightly sanitized, but the eschewing of period effects makes the album sound fresh even today.  And lest we thing that Steeleye has contented itself with nursery rhymes, under the joyful veneer of &quot;Jack Hall&quot; is a gory tale, and &quot;Shaking of the Sheets&quot; is surely about death, while the frightening &quot;Somebody's Watching&quot; is a triumph of mood and a statement of just how versatile this group can be.  &quot;Tempted and Tried&quot; comes highly recommended because, as in almost all Steeleye recordings, the song selection, arrangement, playing, and sheer enthusiasm are exemplary. Steeleye Span pioneered folk rock along with Fairport convention (whose music I still haven't picked up yet, though I've been meaning to for variety's sake). If you're a Steeleye Span fan, you will like this CD. Period. It's a Steeleye classic, and one of my many favorites.Skip the newer releases, like: They Called Her Babylon, Bedlam Born, Bloody Men.Go for the Classics: Tempted and Tried, All Around my Hat, Sails of Silver, Storm Force Ten, Rocket Cottage, Hark! The Village Wait, Please to See the King, Ten Man Mop, Commoners Crown, Now We Are Six, Parcel of Rogues.If you must pick up ""modern"" Steelye albums, pick up: Time (one of their best ""modern"" releases) and Horkstow Grange (their other good ""modern"" release). ""Winter"" is supposed to also be good, on par with the classics (traditional arrangements of holiday songs), though I haven't yet seen it.The above ""classic"" albums cover the early and middle years. I agree that Steeleye Span's best years were the early years, when they recorded and toured regularly together, but this album has much to commend it. Recorded (it seems) to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of their original formation, this is an album full of contrasts with one disappointing track. The songs are a mix of traditional and original songs. Death is a common theme - about half the songs here are about death in one form or another.The album opens with Padstow, a bright and cheerful traditional song about the May Day festivities in that Cornish seaside resort. Next comes The fox, an interesting original song about foxhunting, taken from the perspective of a confident fox who expects to win the battles against the horses and hounds. Two butchers, a traditional song, is about two men on horseback who hear cries of distress from nearby woods. One of the men thinks it a trap but the other believes the cries are genuine. Find out what happens for yourself. Two original songs come after that - Following me (about a stalker) and Seagull (about the old game of shove-penny).The disappointment is The cruel mother, which comes acrossas a monotonous dirge but could have been brilliant. It is about a mother who kills her new-orn baby. When the mother eventually dies, she turns up at the gates of Heaven where she meets the child that she killed. The mother doesn't recognize the child but the child recognizes the mother. Unfortunately, the verse about the killing and the verse about the mother attempting to enter Heaven are treated as one long verse while the concluding lines about the mother's punishment are scarcely audible. I assume that they were trying to dramatize the song but their efforts completely backfired. I had to study the lyrics carefully to figure out what the song was about.After that, the quality of the album returns to normal. All the remaining songs are traditional beginning with Jack Hall, a song about a man facing execution. Another traditional song, Searching for lambs, is about a shepherd falling in love. Shaking of the sheets is about a funeral ceremony. A reels medley comes next followed by the concluding song, Betsy Bell and Mary Gray, about two Scottish women who die of the plague.In many ways, this is a brilliant album although not quite up to the standard of their seventies music. However, I am obliged to remove one star for The cruel mother.

Good sound and artists, but thought each song was a bit repetitive.  Lots of rhythm with strong drums and good vocals. Of all the albums by Tshala Muana available on Amazon, this one is the one that I was most satified with... mainly this is because of the high-quality musicianship with a minimum of the cheesy-sounding synthesizers and drum machines.

If you've read Peace Corps volunteer Kris Holloway's great memoir, Monique and the Mango Rains: Two Years with a Midwife in Mali, you know the grim realities for its women --- they marry young and often die in childbirth. As for female cutting, it's pretty much the rule.And yet the culture of Mali permits --- even encourages --- women to sing.This isn't immediately apparent in the music from Mali I've praised on these screens. In part, that's because all of its musicians are in the shadow of the great blues guitarist (and farmer) Ali Farka Toure. And I find no singer more evocative that Boubacar Triore. So until now the only woman I've showcased is Mariam Doumbia, who is half of the spectacular duo, Amadou & Mariam.That's why it gives me great pleasure to alert you to the charms of a CD that features eleven of Mali's best-known female singers. Let's put that in perspective: I love the music of Mali --- and I knew none of them. Does that make them esoteric, cult, obscure? Depends on where you're sitting and how you feel about people whose names elude easy memorization.Although you may not know of these women, you have only to hear them once to want to hear them again and again. For this is spirited music, subtle and sophisticated and rich with unexpected harmonies and rhythms. It's backed by instruments that sound, at first, wondrous strange --- a modified harp and a xylophone, for example --- and then just wondrous. These divas are Q-tips for the imagination.I've gleaned a few of the musicians' stories, and they go beyond the classic American success story of a hardscrabble youth, a church choir and a chance meeting with a talent scout. Nahawa Doumbia, for one. Shortly after her birth, her mother predicted that Nahawa would be a singer. Then she died, leaving her to be raised by a grandmother who consulted blacksmiths, hoping that their alleged magical powers would change the girl's fate. In 1980, over her father's objections, she entered a national contest and won.Listening to ""Divas of Mali"" reminds me of the myth of the terrible emperor, who threw his victims into a giant copper pot --- and then heated the pot. But the vessel was so shaped that, as the heat became more and more intense, the screams of the victims sounded more and more like beautiful music. So it is here. Out of terrible poverty and centuries of oppression, these singers find great energy, strength and joy. You won't understand the words and there's no lyric sheet to give you a clue, but it won't matter --- you can't mistake the exuberance of these far too low-profile divas.","Africa,World Music,Pop,Mali",bamako capital mali derived word means crocodile swamp take metaphor landlocked country largest west africa seven centuries ago mali controlled much african gold trade worlds fifth poorest nation youve read peace corps volunteer kris holloways great memoir monique mango rains two years midwife mali know grim realities women marry young often die childbirth female cutting pretty much rule yet culture mali permits even encourages women sing isnt immediately apparent mali ive praised screens part thats musicians shadow great blues guitarist farmer ali farka toure find singer evocative boubacar triore woman ive showcased mariam doumbia half spectacular duo amadou mariam thats gives great pleasure alert bamako capital mali derived word means crocodile swamp metaphor landlocked landlocked country country west africa africa centuries mali controlled african gold gold trade trade worlds fifth nation read peace peace corps corps volunteer great memoir monique mango rains years mali know grim grim realities realities women marry young die childbirth female cutting pretty pretty much rule culture mali permits encourages women sing isnt immediately apparent mali praised screens musicians shadow great blues blues guitarist guitarist farmer find singer evocative boubacar woman mariam mariam doumbia doumbia half spectacular duo amadou mariam great pleasure alert
478,901,B000000E5C,"Fabulous!  A really excellent CD, a must for lovers of superb singing!  More, more! I bought this album some years ago, not realizing it was done in 1996.Talitha apparently had her ear to the ground, because some of the beats she was using are everywhere now. Blending Scots Gaelic sources with WorldBeat and electronic music, she's created an interesting fusion album that catches the listener's ear and never lets you forget that this is traditional music, only modernized. In ten years, this album has held up very well, sounding as hip and cool as your new cell phone tone. Oh, there are a few tunes that sound as if you're back in the 18th century, such ""Griogare"", mournful and beautiful, but generally it's as modern as a microchip. Talitha Mackenzie takes traditional Gaelic songs and adds pop rhythyms and jazzy backgrounds to transform these songs into something new and intriguing. It's a bouncy album with a strong emphasis on beat. Good for dancing to. Talitha's strong vocals are backed by a wide range of instruments, congas, marimbas, saxaphone, electric violin, to name just a few.  This album does combine a lot of unusual sound and voice combinations, but it seems to all work well together. If you prefer the more traditional Gaelic singing and acoustic back up, this probably won't fit the bill.Nearly all the songs on this CD are Gaelic in origin, with the exceptions of #4 Hopa! (Bulgarian), #5 Ajde Jano (Serbian) and #8 Changerais-Tu? (Breton).  Translations of all songs are provided on the liner notes.I add this CD into the mix when I need something upbeat and a little unusual to spice up an afternoon. If you can, check out a sample of a song or two here, #3 Fionnaghula is one of my favorites and #6 Fear A' Bhata is simply beautiful. This is another case where Amazon groups reviews of all releases of a CD (or, in many cases, DVDs) of a particular album together. It's always important to sort the reviews by ""most recent"" and to look at the date the review was posted. This review is of the 2013 US release of an album originally recorded and released in 1996. Most, but not all, of the album is the same as the '96 release, with some English words added to two tracks. (You really won't notice the words though because on the opening track they are blended in to the mix and for the last track ""3 Things"" the English lyrics are whispered. But these are minor points.I hadn't heard the earlier release so I only had this one to catch my ear, and catch my ear it did! MacKensie was born and raised in Long Island, NY but moved to Scotland in 1987. Most of the songs here are sung in Gaelic but there are some in Balkan and the two styles really work well together. It becomes even more ""worldly"" on the sixth track - ""Saor an t-Sabhaidh"" (don't ask me how to pronounce it!), where Mackenzie ""sampled"" African gumboot dances to give an African twist to the Scotish Strathsprey.The 12-panel insert to the album provides the lyrics in both the native language and with English translation. This is helpful so you have some idea of what Mackenzie is singing about. But, honestly, the first time through, just listen to ""sound"" of the songs and her voice. That is enough to recommend this album.See the earlier reviews for comments from those who discovered the earlier version of the album. You'll see I'm not alone in recommending this release.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"" Before listening to this CD I was apprehensive.  I enjoyed Ms. MacKenzie's previous works, ""Mouth Music"" and ""Solas"", tremendously but didn't know how I'd feel about a album that strayed a bit from the traditional Gaelic essence of those albums by including a Serbian tune and a French (Breton) song.I must now admit that I am addicted to the song ""Changerais-Tu?""  It fills me with a bubbly sense of glee that climaxes in a silly giggle each time I hear the goat holler.  I listen to this song over and over and over again.  I've learned the words by heart and find myself singing it around the house, while I'm walking the dogs, while we're waiting to be seated at restaurants, etc.My wife has threatened to leave me if I can't kick this thing.  Can someone out there help me?  Please?Oh, there are good Gaelic tunes on here too.","Europe,Ireland,British Isles,Scotland,Pop,Britain,World Music,Folk",fabulous really excellent cd must lovers superb singing bought years ago realizing done talitha apparently ear ground beats using everywhere blending scots gaelic sources worldbeat electronic shes created interesting fusion catches listeners ear never lets forget traditional modernized ten years held well sounding hip cool new cell phone tone oh tunes sound youre back th century griogare mournful beautiful generally modern microchip talitha mackenzie takes traditional gaelic adds pop rhythyms jazzy backgrounds transform something new intriguing bouncy strong emphasis beat good dancing talithas strong vocals backed wide range instruments congas fabulous really excellent cd lovers superb singing bought years years ago realizing talitha apparently ear ground beats blending scots scots gaelic gaelic sources worldbeat electronic created interesting fusion catches listeners ear lets forget traditional modernized years held sounding hip cool new cell cell phone phone tone tunes sound youre century mournful beautiful generally modern microchip talitha talitha mackenzie traditional gaelic adds pop rhythyms jazzy backgrounds transform new intriguing strong emphasis beat good dancing talithas strong vocals wide range instruments congas
479,903,B000000E5M,"There are several Irish bands out there who sound quite good. Solas is a world away better. A brilliant band with talent beyond reproach, their music just grows on you. They are without question the most cutting edge  Irish group that has not forgotton what Celtic music means. Don't hesitate  purchasing any of their albums. You won't be dissapointed! Well, I guess I took a while to purchase a Solas CD. I did buy Karan Casey's &quot;Songlines&quot; and thought it was an outstanding piece of musical workmanship, but when combined with the group, she sounds even  better.With Deanta no longer singing as a group, Solas has to be the  best Irish Folk Rock group around. Karen sounds fantastic in Aililiu Na  Gamhna, even if I don't have clue what she is singing about! . This song  is fast becoming one of my favorite Celtic songs of all time. I suppose I  could give a quick review on all the songs Karan sings in this CD, but to  keep it short and sum it in one word...lets just she sounds GREAT!I  also liked the fast pace playing of the banjo in track 2, The Big Reel of  Ballynacally and the reels on track 4 and 5.All in all, this CD has no  musical weaknesses to speak of. The numerous songs, airs, jigs and reels  are sung and played to perfection. I enthusiastically give this two thumbs  up and 5 stars. (except where s/he proposes there be any reason at ALL that one should listen to Barry Manilow!!!)I'm afraid I can't recommend this CD or this band, with Karan or without. The songs and tunes DO have a dreary sameness and predictability about them. Mind you, if that one sound happens to be one you LIKE, perhaps this is just the ticket. Karan Casey does have a beautiful voice, but it's better served on her solo efforts. What I find about Solas is that they take all the lilt and joy out of the trad Irish tunes, which are primarily dance tunes and ought to sound more HAPPY. At times frenetic, at times grinding, full of perhaps nervous energy--- this is music by which to pack for a month's vacation when your plane leaves in an hour. If you want some really lilting, cheery, irresistably DANCEABLE traditional music, have a listen to Danu. If you like the heavy-on-the-strings sound, Bohola does it much better. I can also recommend both bands our friend in Buffalo mentioned, Tempest and Horslips, with the caveat that they are Celtic *rock* bands Sunny Spells and Scattered Showers is more of the same that can be found on their self-titled debut, but the band has obviously matured.  John Williams, Winifred Horan, and Seamus Egan are all in top form.  John Doyle's guitar has become more refined and he truly shines on this album, his playing transcending mere backup.  Karan Casey is a delight to hear, especially on the track ""Aililiu Na Gamhna"".I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Irish traditional music.  You won't be disappointed! This is an outstanding effort, mixing textures and tempos expertly. The  cover of Unquiet Grave is beautifully haunting- Karan will be sorely  missed. If you like Altan, you will not go wrong with Solas. As regards the  guitar comments from Buffalo: Yes, the guitar is driving and prominent, but  that has always been a cornerstone of the Solas sound. The musicianship of  each and every memeber is well beyond reproach, in my humble opinion. Go  see them live, and you will be ready to hug the guitarist (and everyone  else around) in your excitement! This band is like a sunny day in the middle of winter: a pleasant and much-welcomed surprise.  They bring an energy level and mastery of their respective instruments that is quite rare these days. From Seamus Egan on various wind instruments to John Doyle's riveting acoustic guitar work, this band combines to create some of the most captivating music around. This CD has a great mixture of acoustic tracks as well as tunes with some haunting vocals.  I've had the wonderful pleasure of seeing Solas twice in concert in the last year (at an outdoor folk festival and at The Ark in Ann Arbor) and I can say their live performances are just as impressive and compelling as this CD.  Check it out. Solas is the absolute best traditional Irish group currently performing. SUNNY SPELLS is, I think, the best of their three albums to date (though all three are worth getting). I haven't heard their new singer yet, but  Karan Casey left some big shoes to fill. This is one of my favorite Irish albums. I've given it as a gift and definitely recommend it to others. Some of the songs are extremely dour and morbid - far beyond what you'd hear in American music, but this is traditional Irish music and the songs are raw and sad. The unquiet grave is almost shockingly sad, but very well done. The album is well balanced between tunes and songs and Karen Casey's voice is always a pleasure to listen to. Enjoy! As with the review of Solas' debut CD, &quot;music fan&quot; from Buffalo could not be more off the mark.  Again (this is repeating some of the review of that debut), the criticisms sound more like a criticism of the entire genre, from someone who doesn't know the genre enough to hear the distinctions and thus thinks it all sounds the same.  And to describe guitarist John Doyle's playing as &quot;the same two chords&quot; is just mind-bogglingly inept.  Ask somebody who plays guitar for an Irish band, as I do, whether Doyle is in fact playing &quot;two chords,&quot; or whether we have a guitarist of immense subtlety and expertise, comping the melody players with interplay that is at times truly jaw-dropping, upbeating and backbeating the rhythms, inventing progressions with twists and suspensions and various inversions that make you want to go try them yourself, if you're a player.  This guy is as good as it gets in this business.As for the allegation that Solas sounds pretty much the same as lots of other traditional bands (albeit with &quot;a little more energy&quot;), well...again, ask some local Irish musicians you know to listen to some of the better tracks here.  Try them out on &quot;Tom Busby's et al.&quot; or &quot;Paddy Taylor's et al.&quot;  (Actually, if you want the real clincher, let 'em hear the #8 track--&quot;Dougie MacDonald's et al&quot;--on Solas' debut CD. That'll do it.)  This is pure virtuosity.I mean, what Solas did with &quot;Wind that Shakes the Barley&quot; (the first track) is worth half the price of the CD.  There you have a ballad that in its original form (e.g., the Clancys' version), love its tradition as we all do, still is not the kind of thing that would draw anyone outside Irish music to an appreciation of the genre.  Along comes Solas and redoes the thing entirely by reworking the melody and giving the whole thing a Galician flavor.  This is a perfect example of how the early Solas was able to breathe new life into an old standard while still working within traditional lines.As for the carping about &quot;soft schlocky ballads&quot;:  There's probably a grain of truth here for someone _outside_ the genre, because Irish and Scottish traditional songs do tend to get repetitive (lots of verses-in-a-row kinda thing).  And if you're not listening to (or not interested in) the words to something like &quot;Unquiet Grave&quot;--if you're waiting for something &quot;exciting&quot; to grab you--it's really not.  (On the other hand, if you listen to the words, it's one of the truly most emotional songs around, an intensely sad expression of how the pre-Christian Celtic &quot;dead is dead&quot; notion affects a grieving lover.)  Or if you don't understand Gaelic, maybe &quot;Aililiu na Gamhna&quot; will be one of those tracks you click past.  But then, &quot;Maid on the Shore&quot; and &quot;Adieu Lovely Nancy&quot; are very nice ballads in the traditional vein that do not require this kind of in-genre special attention.  (Also, &quot;Maid&quot; includes an instrumental melodic line that is close to genius--a near-reversal of the melody in &quot;Wind that Shakes the Barley,&quot; with the line spiraling wildly upward, midway through the album, helping to establish a subtle structural wholeness to the CD.)Hey, short version is, buy it.  Or listen to it somewhere and then buy it.  Then write Solas, tell them we miss them, and beg them to get back to this kind of music. I ordered this CD to practice my bodhran to, and it is very good for that purpose.","Europe,Irish Folk,Ireland,Celtic Folk,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Celtic New Age,Pop,Traditional Folk,New Age,British Folk,Britain,World Music,Folk",several irish bands sound quite good solas world away better brilliant band talent beyond reproach grows without question cutting edge irish group forgotton celtic means dont hesitate purchasing wont dissapointed well guess took purchase solas cd buy karan caseys quot songlines quot thought outstanding piece musical workmanship combined group sounds even better deanta longer singing group solas best irish folk rock group around karen sounds fantastic aililiu na gamhna even dont clue singing fast becoming one favorite celtic time suppose could give quick review karan sings cd keep short sum one word lets sounds great also liked fast pace playing irish bands sound quite good world away better brilliant band talent reproach grows question cutting edge irish group celtic means hesitate purchasing wont guess purchase cd buy karan karan caseys songlines quot thought outstanding piece musical workmanship combined group group sounds sounds better deanta singing group best irish irish folk folk folk rock rock rock group group karen sounds fantastic clue singing fast favorite celtic time suppose quick review karan sings cd keep short sum word lets sounds great liked fast pace playing
480,904,B000000E5Q,"Pipes and harp, some unaccompanied singing.Joe and Antoinette McKenna play wonderfully both alone and together. The album is full of good tunes and a few airs, and there isn't a dull spot. The tunes really shine when there aren't too many instruments or too much production to occlude the character of the music, and on this album there isn't any of that.  There is some shining and skillful regulator work.  I believe Joe McKenna is also a maker of pipes, although I don't know if he was when he made this album, or not.  McKenna was also a pupil of the late Leo Rowsome and needless to say, these two know their stuff.

481,908,B000000E62,"It doesn't matter whether you're an American or from the British Isles.  This music brings simple Irish music to the ears of Americans.  Dulaman- The title track, fun to listen to.Cumha Eoghain Rua Ui Neil- Lovely harp instrumental track, very poignant also.The Two Sisters- A humorous story about a sibling rivaly.  I like it better than Loreena McKennitt's version because this version sounds more traditional and Irish.  It also, like the other tracks, has very lovely whistle and flute music.Eirigh Suas A Stoirin- The beginning is a little out of tune, but the rest of the song is very moving and touching.  Another very poignant version is found on Maire's album &quot;Mysty Eyed Adventures&quot;.The Galtee Hunt- I love this lovely track.  The cheerful beat and soothing whistle music expresses the Irish pride and dignity.Rise and Dress Yourself(long Gaelic title)- Much of this song is instrumental, but the Gaelic words tell a love story, just like many of the other songs.  It's very energetic with a good use of harp, guitar, mandolin, and flute.Siuil A Run- The most touching song of all, this song expresses the woe of having a loved one out at war, while desiring to have your love by your side.  Most of the song is in English, but the Gaelic verse speaks for itself.  I highly recomend checking out another version on the Chieftains album &quot;Tears of Stone&quot;, performed by singer Sissel.Mo Mhaire- This song often reminds me of Maire!dTigeas A Damhsa- A very short, but simple a capella.Cucandy/The Jug of Brown Ale- Two jigs that give a final great expression of Irish spirit.This early Clannad album may sound different from their albums nowadays, but it does well in expressing the Irish voice and spirit.  I hope they continue performing traditional songs that show what Ireland's music is all about. My favorite music. So soulful. I especially liked the songs: Dulaman, Siuil a Ruin, Ma Mhoire, and Jug of Ale, although the other ones were also good. I find Maire Bhrennain's voice soothing as well as haunting despite the transgression of time. I have since listened to other Clannad songs including: Harry's Theme and Newgrange and I find them also very appealing. As a child I used to sing the chorus of the song Dulaman whenever my mom played her LP version. I absolutely love this cd; this is Clannad at their best. Two Sisters is a a very popular song...it's just one version out of many different versions about a tale where the oldest sister pushes the youngest sister into the water just because of a man. Lorenna McKennitt has made a a version of this: The Bonny Swans. And after hearing the Two Sisters, Clannad's version is remarkably better. Give this cd a chance, you'll be glad you did. Before Clannad became a popular new age outfit (insert ""sold out"" somewhere in that line), they were a folk group producing seriously good celtic music. Dulaman is, in my opinion, their best album. The vocals have never been tighter, the music never sweeter, the production never as honest as you will find here. A superb, delicate album. Dulaman was the third studio album from Clannad, circa 1976.  As with much of their early material, a first airing might convince listeners that they are in the presence of a fairly traditional and pleasant if somewhat unadventurous Irish band.  This is a complete delusion.  From day one Clannad were much more than this.  The jazz and world influences, the use of harp and flute in lieu of the more standard fiddle and accordion, the unique vocal stylings, and the sense of magic and mystery have affected all of Clannad's work to varying degrees, and in these early years took them and their fans where even the modern Celtic bands fear to tread.  Maire's vocals had matured considerably by this time as had the accompaniment of her kith and kin.  The interpretations are liberal and yet respectful, especially on the stunning title track, the musically cheery but lyrically macabre &quot;Two Sisters&quot;, the classic &quot;Siul a Run&quot;, the dissonant &quot;Mo Mhaire&quot;, and the gorgeous instrumentals &quot;Cumha Eoghain Rua Ui Neill&quot; and &quot;Cucanandy/The Jug of Brown Ale&quot;, the latter suite being one of the most spiritually uplifting epilogues imaginable.  The production is superb and the acoustic instruments blend into the channels in a gratifying way.  Before Clannad were complex, before they influenced Enya and she in turn influenced them, they were deceptively simple, understated, and rock solid, as demonstrated by this timeless work. I agree, don't listen to the reviewer who said some tracks are &quot;god  awful&quot; and &quot;if you're an American you won't like it.&quot;  I'm  an American, and I *love* this album.  Love Clannad 2, as well. It's not  straight folk and it's not as electrified as Steeleye Span, and other than  that it's playful, romantic, haunting, spirited music. I discovered it in  college and still enjoy it 15 years later.Peigi I love this CD...From the opening strains of the title track to the gaeity of &quot;Two Sister&quot; and the bittersweetness of &quot;The Galtee Hunt&quot;, this is a true Celtic masterpiece.  Both playful and mystical, it takes me far away and offers escape. Great album.  I bought the CD used but the CD I received was in perfect condition.  If you love Clannad, you will love this CD. This is a wonderful collection of music by Clannad.  I am ever-looking to add to my passion for Celtic music and this one from Clannad is a must have to anyone's Celtic collection.  What a treat to hear Maire's beautiful voice from some 40 years ago.  Wow!  From the first track to the last you can do far worse than this fine collection of music by this timeless Celtic Classic. The journey of discovery continues--what joy! Thanks much to Amazon and Accuradio's RadioCelt for opening a whole world of beautiful music to me. Nevermind the review which says some tracks are &quot;god-awful&quot; it's all wrong. I don't like Clannad's later synth music, but back in the 70's, they were an amazing band. There is not a bad track on this album, although  'Suiul A Run' and 'd'Tigeas A Damhsa' stand out above all the others. Even  though the album is celtic, it's got a sound which is all it's own. A very rare collection.Since its sung in irish , how would i know? My copy was released in 1988 from Shenachie in nj. Im stilllistening and learning about the band. Enjoy.

482,910,B000000E65,"This is classic Irish music.  I listen to it pretty often, although I prefer the first album by Planxty.  After the break is another great Planxty album.

The Chieftains are great, no argument, but the voice has always been my favorite instrument in every genre of music, and Planxty cannot be beat for fine examples of Irish song.  This is not the sing-along, stout-fueled pub atmostphere that most people associate with this genre -- this is more akin to the story-ballads sung by the raconteurs of an earlier era.  This is the 'real deal'.All four members of this stellar ensemble are incredible musicians and song-stylists in their own right.  Liam Og O Floinn is without a doubt one of the finest Uilleann pipers of the modern age;  Christy Moore and Andy Irvine have few peers among singers;  and between them, Andy Irvine and Donal Lunny could surround us with stringed instruments.  Though the group is no longer active as an entity, through their already-classic album releases, they have left us with an amazing legacy of some of the finest music Ireland has ever produced.  All are still active individually -- O Floinn is a respected piper still;  Moore has released several fine 'solo' records;  Andy Irivine has put out albums on his own as well as with others, most notably the Irish 'super-group' Patrick Street; and Donal Lunny has not only released some fine material of his own (including stints with two other ground-breaking ensembles, The Bothy Band and Moving Hearts), but has become a well-respected producer as well.I first heard this album soon after its original release in the early 1970s -- a friend of mine rushed into my workplace and announced seriously 'You HAVE to hear this -- it'll blow you away'.  Later that night we must have listened to the album 3-4 times in succession -- we couldn't get enough of it.The musicianship is superb, the recording quality pristine (especially considerering when it was released!) -- this is an excellent starting place for anyone unfamiliar with Planxty's work.  From here, go back to the first album ('Planxty'), then try their reunion album from 1979, where the four are augmented by Irish flute master Matt Molloy (the only man to have played with the Holy Trinity of Irish traditional music -- The Chieftains, Planxty, and The Bothy Band).Again, this is the 'real deal' -- none of that 'kiss me, I'm Irish crapola...Listen and prepare to be moved. A fantastic album, as Planxty jostles for the position of best traditional Irish band ever. As technically proficient as any group anywhere, a well produced album which will be treasured by all folk and Irish afficianados.","Europe,Irish Folk,Ireland,Celtic Folk,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Soul,Pop,Traditional Folk,R&B,Britain,Traditional Blues,World Music,Blues,Folk",classic irish listen pretty often although prefer first planxty break another great planxty highly recommended like traditional irish andys mandolin im sure traditional far interesting celtic commonly see around stores great price service great scoring planxty indeed indeed indeed yes yes yes yes yes yes planxtys nd official first christy moore solo outing prosperous first together match lit fire irish traditional chieftains great argument voice always favorite instrument every genre planxty cannot beat fine examples irish sing along stout fueled pub atmostphere people associate genre akin story ballads sung raconteurs earlier era real classic irish listen pretty prefer break great highly recommended traditional irish mandolin sure traditional far interesting celtic commonly see stores great price service great scoring official moore solo prosperous match lit fire irish traditional chieftains great argument voice favorite instrument genre beat fine examples irish sing sing along stout fueled pub people associate genre akin story ballads sung raconteurs earlier era real

Normally, I am a die-hard rock and roller, but this cd has really expanded my musical preferences. Some songs on the second side I wouldn't have ordered as they didn't have the sparkle of the rest of the collection.  Wish there were a way to here each choice in its entirety before purchase. I recently heard Raggle Taggle Gypsy on the radio and remembered how I loved this record when it first came out in the 70s. I still have the old vinyl record somewhere in storage (probably unplayable)and I try to listen to new music rather than buying old things again as CDs but this is one exception. It's still one of the finest collections of Irish music ever put together and has not dated at all! If anything it sounds even stronger now compared to much of the newer stuff coming out of Ireland. That segue from 'RTG' into to 'Tabhair..' is magnificent, leaves me exhilirated every time. Oh.. and I've always wanted to thank Planxty for the highest scoring Scrabble word I ever managed to make!! What a brilliant collection!

484,912,B000000E6E,"If you like Silly Wizard you'll like this, nothing special just good music. I like bagpipes but not in everything so this is good Scottish music without pipes. Just play ""Donald McGillavry/O'Neill's Cavalry March"" as loud as you can on your home or car stereo.  Then you'll know why Silly Wizard was one of the best bands to emerge from Scotland's traditionalist revival years during the 1970s and 1980s.  Hearing Phil Cunningham on piano accordion (don't panic; he's great on the Stomach Steinway) with his late brother, Johnny Cunningham, on fiddle is never less than thrilling, and Andy Stewart's lead vocals, which can tack toward saccharine on other albums, are thoroughly convincing here.  (His banjo playing, however, has always been pedestrian, no matter what Frets magazine might have said about it.)  Martin Hadden and Gordon Jones capably anchor the rhythm in a quintet who, in concert, delivered excellent music and large dollops of humor.The top five bands in Scottish traditional music from this era remain Ossian (only with Tony Cuffe), Silly Wizard (only with Johnny Cunningham), Kentigern (largely forgotten today, but well worth the effort to track down; Sylvia Barnes's voice is stunning), Tannahill Weavers (only with Alan MacLeod), and the Battlefield Band (only with Brian McNeill)--in that order of preference. I know others may quibble with the order and perhaps the picks, but in my mind you can't go wrong with these five. &quot;So Many Partings&quot; was the first CD I heard by Silly Wizard, and I *had* to have it.  The musicianship is marvelous on the instrumentals (Phil Cunningham has *got* to be the most amazing accordionist ever).  However, it was Andy M. Stewart's voice and lyrics that really got hold of  me and didn't let go.  &quot;The Valley of Strathmore&quot; brought tears  to my eyes upon the first listen ... incredibly beautiful ... and I am  still known to shed a tear when I hear it again.  I cannot recommend this  CD highly enough to admirers of Celtic music. This album has everything for the celtic music fan (exciting instrumentals, a magical blending of voices, some songs in gaelic).

485,913,B000000E6F,"What happened to the ""A Mother's Love""?  I had the LP YEARS ago but this song is not listed on the cd . . . I have noticed this with several other cds that are supposed to be reissues of old LPs.  Who's editing these albums and why?  Anyone?  Thanks. According to the album insert, &quot;The predominant theme of De Danann's new LP featuring singer Maura O'Connell from Ennis is the awakened interest in the heyday of Irish-American music in the 1920's.&quot; I enjoyed this album, but I can't say anything jumped out as outstanding -- with the exception of 2 songs: Maggie and Come Back Again To Me, Mavourneen (both performed by O'Connell). The remaining songs are average old-fashioned Irish tunes, jigs, and reels.I first found out about De Danann from an album called Celtic Tapestry. I found myself enamoured by the voice singing the song Maggie. I learned that Maggie was on their Star Spangled Molly album and purchased it in hopes of hearing more of that wonderful voice. Unfortunately, that singer (Maura O'Connell) only performs 3 songs on the album. She has since started her own successful solo career.If you like older, more traditional styles of Irish/Celtic music you will probably enjoy this album. If you like the newer styles of Irish/Celtic music (like The Corrs or Loreena McKennitt), you may not be happy with this album. I first heard cuts from this album on a Boston-area PBS station's weekly Celtic music program. I liked it enough to buy the album.  I wasn't disappointed. It is indeed what my grandparents (who earned their boozing money singing in the local pubs and bars in Revere, MA)would have enjoyed and performed. &quot;Period&quot; vocals and excellent instrumental pieces. I'm happy I bought it! Twenty plus years ago I heard Maura sing &quot;Maggie&quot; at the Birchmere.  She came on between sets of  Sam Bush and Bela Fleck (don't forget John Cowan) She was young and so was I.  I have heard the echo of that song for many years and was so delighted to find this CD.

486,915,B000000E6X,"This is real music, of the sort you'd expect to hear on a Saturday evening at a local pub--warm, rousing, and authentic.  Silly Wizard's distinctive sound is defined by the deft accordion-playing of Phil Cunningham and the heartfelt, unpretentious vocals of Cunningham and lead singer Andy M. Stewart.  Martin Haddin on keyboards and guitars and Gordon Jones on guitar and bodhran round out the core quartet, which is joined on this album by fiddler Dougie MacLean and drummer Roy Ashby.  The accordion-led dance sets, tracks 2, 6, 7 and 8, are lively and winning, and Stewart's broguish singing in the slow numbers, such as ""If I Was a Blackbird"" and ""The Fishermen's Song"", is so genuine and understatedly heartfelt that it just tugs at my heart every time I hear it.  Browsers whose computers will only let them sample the first few tracks should be aware that this album starts out on the slow side but really ends with a bang on the last three sets.  Something that both dates and distinguishes the music of Silly Wizard is the use of keyboards such as that featured in ""The Pearl"", which sound rather like a pedaled, electrified harpsichord.  It's a timbre not heard much these days in the instrumentations of newer Celtic groups, but it actually compliments the reedy sound of an accordion and the plucking of guitar strings quite nicely.  Good overviews of Silly Wizard's output include ""The Best of Silly Wizard"" and ""Live Wizardry"".  For contemporaneous work of Phil Cunningham, check out ""Gathering Pace"" by Relativity, starring Phil and his brother Johnny, along with siblings Triona Ni Domhnaill and Michael O Domhnaill. These guys are great and although I'm Scottish I don't need to hear bagpipes on everything. Good mellow music.Kilts rule! The first time I heard the Fisherman's Song, I was stunned by its simplicity and poignancy, not to mention the beautiful and organic quality of the poetry. This song showcases the power of Andy Stewart's voice. It also shows his talent at staging a drama that sounds raw and inescapable, yet is somehow made bearable through the use of strikingly telling metaphors.Other songs on this album are worth their salt: If I Was a Blackbird is a classic of Celtic music and a favorite of mine. I like the rendition here. Hame,Hame,Hame is a wonderful song, followed by a lovely melody (Tha Mi Sgith=I'm tired) that speaks less of green fields than it does of introspection and internal landscapes, as the title suggests.The other instrumentals are also very good. A little less daring/modern than in 'A Gling of Silver,' but still masterfully executed. A powerful album, just as illustrated by the sun setting on the loch (on the cover) and the name it sports. This is my favorite Irish recording. The way he sings is just unbelievable, it's touching and always perfect in tone. There are several instrumental pieces which seem very traditional and evoke almost a Medieval  flavor. It's a very relaxing album, not too many fast paced songs. It's  good to listen to when you just want to sit back and listen to the stories  he sings. They are so timeless in their theme and he makes you believe that  they all happened to him. This is a beautiful example of modern Scottish music.  I've enjoyed this CD very much.  Thank you for making it.","Europe,Irish Folk,Contemporary Folk,Ireland,Scotland,British Isles,Pop,British & Celtic Folk,Celtic New Age,Scottish Folk,Traditional Folk,New Age,R&B,Britain,Traditional Blues,World Music,Contemporary R&B,Contemporary Blues,Soul,Blues,Folk",real sort youd expect hear saturday evening local pub warm rousing authentic silly wizards distinctive sound defined deft accordion playing phil cunningham heartfelt unpretentious vocals cunningham lead singer andy stewart martin haddin keyboards guitars gordon jones guitar bodhran round core quartet joined fiddler dougie maclean drummer roy ashby accordion led dance sets lively winning stewarts broguish singing slow numbers blackbird fishermens genuine understatedly heartfelt tugs heart every time hear browsers whose computers let sample first aware starts slow side really ends bang last three sets something dates distinguishes silly wizard use real sort expect hear saturday local pub warm rousing authentic silly silly wizards wizards distinctive sound defined deft accordion playing phil cunningham heartfelt unpretentious vocals lead lead singer singer andy stewart keyboards guitars gordon gordon jones jones guitar bodhran round core quartet joined dougie maclean maclean drummer roy accordion led dance sets lively winning broguish singing slow numbers fishermens genuine understatedly heartfelt tugs heart time hear browsers computers let sample aware starts slow side really ends bang sets dates distinguishes silly silly wizard wizard
487,916,B000000E71,"I owned this when it first came out (how I miss that vinyl!), and even though I haven't listened to it in over a decade (my discs and I became separated over all my moves in the passing years) its lyrics and melodies still come easily - and happily - to mind.  I don't think I'll ever forget it. I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about.  I have had this disc for a few years and it is my favorite Planxty.  Hands down.  The GEM on this disc, the centerpiece, is Lord Baker.  It gives me chills.  The vocals are perfect, the drumming is right on, and the bouzouki is fantastic. I love Planxty, but I am not sure if I totally embrace this album.  The instrumental tracks are outstanding.  Liam O'Flynn's piping is great, and the tunes are expertly and beautifully arranged (the &quot;Irish Marche,&quot; the closing track, is stirring).  In fact, it is the instrumental pieces that save the album, for the vocal selections are a rather mixed bunch.  &quot;Thousands are Sailing,&quot; with traditional words and a lovely melody by Donal Lunny and Andy Irvine is very good, and &quot;Aragon Mill&quot; is a nice piece as well.  I guess it's the two tracks sung by Christy Moore that drag the album down.  Now I have to say that I enjoyed the old Christy Moore that appeared on the first album and other earlier albums.  But the Christy Moore that appears on this album (and unfortunately, the one by which he became so popular, which I will never understand) stinks.  He is awful.  He seems to have started that mumbling delivery which became his solo trademark, and which (I believe) shows someone losing his singing ability but not admitting it.  He sounds like he's trying to sing with his mouth closed. &quot;Lord Baker&quot; could have been interesting -- if it had been sung by anyone else and cut down from its seemingly interminable length of about nine minutes.  &quot;I Pity the Poor Immigrant,&quot; by Bob Dylan, is another snoozer for Moore to murmur unintelligibly.  While I definitely recommend the album for Irish music fans, I have to add the caveat to skip those two tracks by Christy Moore. After Cold Blow and the Rainy Night this is a good album. But back in the eighties I owned on vinyl The Kings of Tara by Planxty. Why is this not available? I regard the Kings of Tara collection the best of all the work that planxty ever did, but maybe the fact that I can't get hold of it on CD covers my eyes with rose coloured spectacles. Leave Christy Moore alone. He has brought a lot of joy to my Polynesian family. The Celts were pushed to the edge of a world but the Polynesians kept going. Their music though has the same spirit.[...] Planxty's so colorful and magic. Their playing is right on, energetic and  imaginative.  Here's more beautiful and heartrending ballads amidst raucous  reels and jigs to chase those blues away.","Europe,Irish Folk,Ireland,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,Britain,World Music,Folk",owned first came miss vinyl even though havent listened decade discs became separated moves passing years lyrics melodies still come easily happily mind dont think ill ever forget dont know reviewer talking disc years favorite planxty hands gem disc centerpiece lord baker gives chills vocals perfect drumming right bouzouki fantastic love planxty sure totally embrace instrumental outstanding liam oflynns piping great tunes expertly beautifully arranged quot irish marche quot closing stirring fact instrumental pieces save vocal selections rather mixed bunch quot thousands sailing quot traditional words lovely melody donal lunny came miss vinyl listened decade discs separated passing years lyrics melodies come easily happily mind think ill forget know reviewer talking disc years favorite hands gem disc centerpiece lord lord baker baker chills vocals perfect drumming right bouzouki fantastic love sure totally embrace instrumental outstanding liam oflynns piping great tunes expertly beautifully arranged irish marche quot closing stirring fact instrumental instrumental pieces pieces save vocal selections mixed bunch quot thousands sailing traditional words lovely melody donal lunny

Had I known what the rest of the album was like I would not have bought it -- not that the CD is bad, just doesn't catch my interest. Back in the early eighties, bands that were considered folk were seldom strictly so: either they were folk rock (like The Pogues), or they were simply folk-inflected excuses for psychedelic discursis (like Caravan or Soft Machine). Silly Wizard, on the other hand, played genuine folk music, and this album is a shining example of the genre done right. Moving easily between fast jig-inducing numbers and sad ballads, the band demonstrated on this 1983 release that Celtic folk was still alive and well, and didn't need electrification or drum pads to make it any better than it already was.","Europe,Irish Folk,Contemporary Folk,Ireland,British Isles,Scotland,British & Celtic Folk,Celtic New Age,Scottish Folk,Traditional Folk,New Age,Britain,Pop,World Music,Folk",found essence emotional moving wonderful listen quot sweet dublin bay quot quot golden golden quot quot loch tay boat quot words enough let speak go buy wonderful piece without hesitation ive listened tape often need replace cd recording top favorites list takes far far away dont want come back loch tay boat golden golden particular magic cant really put words must collection bought heard queen argyle didnt really know expect listened cd really love one known rest like would bought cd bad doesnt catch interest back early eighties bands considered folk seldom strictly either folk ro found essence emotional wonderful listen quot sweet dublin dublin bay bay quot quot golden golden quot quot loch loch tay tay boat quot words let speak buy wonderful piece hesitation listened tape need replace cd cd recording recording favorites list far far away want come come back loch tay tay boat golden golden magic really words collection bought heard queen argyle really know expect listened cd really love known rest bought cd bad catch interest early eighties bands considered folk seldom strictly folk ro
489,921,B000000E79,"I feel that the songwriting on Parcel of Rogues isn't quite up to par with Below the Salt, but it's definitely not a drastic downward spiral in quality or anything.  A highly enjoyable album nonetheless that focuses more on pop/rock and a *little* less on folk/rock.""Alison Gross"" is a highlight for me.  Even though it's probably overlong by a few minutes, and even though the verse melody sounds amazingly simplistic, I still admire the way it's written.  The lyrics are funny as well.  It really does have a commecial vibe that leads me to think it should have been a hit in the states.  My favorite song is probably ""The Weaver and the Factory Maid"".  EXTRAORDINARY vocal delivery by Maddy Prior- she really extends her range straight up to heaven during the intro of the song (and near the end when it repeats again).  The verse melody in between is typical affair as far as folk/rock is concerned, but has a nice set of lyrics to back up a pretty good melody.""Hares on the Mountain"" does nothing particularly great in the vocal melody department.  Simplistic to the point of almost being mindless, or rather, like a nursery rhyme.  I've heard the same kind of songwriting from Fairport Convention and Renaissance, but they managed to do it a little better than this.  It's still mighty darn hard (near impossible for that matter) to say I HATE a song like this, however.  ""Hate"" isn't a word I'd probably ever consider using towards a band like Steeleye Span.  I can't imagine they'd ever force me to use such a devastating word.  Then again, well... many bands went downhill as the 70's rolled along.  Who knows what Steeleye Span's later 70's offerings are like.""Rogues in a Nation"" is a hymn of sorts- very quiet with hardly any arrangements, and focused on one standard set of vocals and nothing more.  The violin part at the very end is okay though.  It's memorable, but sort of depressing.  ""The Ups and Downs"" is a bit too traditional with the vocals and the Celtic way.  Not bad, though.  Just not the type of music I'd ever seek out myself.  ""Robbery With Violins"" actually sounds like Jimi Hendrix in the guitar playing, no joke.  But of course, the song would be completely misleading if it didn't actually feature some violins.  It does, but not the type of violins that are very interesting to me personally.  Just a couple notes speeding along for a minute or so.  Nothing really great.Overall, well to be honest, there's no competition here- Below the Salt is *easily* better.  The songwriting is just not as polished in comparison. I have listened to Parcel of Rogues more times and just realized that this is one of their best albums ever! Like before, the band continued updating centuries old folk songs from the British isles with electric instruments with very successful results. This was the second album with the lineup of Maddy Prior, Tim Hart, Rick Kemp, Peter Knight, and Bob Johnson, and without a doubt, in my book, the best with this lineup (although many prefer Below the Salt, I prefer Parcel of Rogues). My favorites here include ""One Misty Moisty Morning"", ""Alison Gross"", ""The Bold Poachers"", ""Robbery With Violins"", and ""Cam Ye O'er Frae France"". ""Robbery With Violins"" is a little odd. The band went for a more funky, '70s style that's much in the style of countless police and detective TV series of the time, and blends that with a way cool folk jig on violin. Odd combination to say the least, but it works real well. Drums make the occasional appearance, which I hear varying sources that it was Rick Kemp, or Nigel Pegrum (the band's full-time drummer starting with Now We Are Six). I totally love the medieval atmosphere of this album, and I can't help but be reminded of medieval faires when listening to this incredible album. Parcel of Rogues just comes to show that Steeleye Span was one of the most important bands of the British folk-rock movement of the late '60s and early '70s, along with Fairport Convention, and The Pentangle. In my opinion, this album ranks up there with Fairport's Liege & Lief as one of the greatest folk-rock albums ever, and so if you like this type of music, particularly with a medieval flavor to it, you can't go wrong here. This album, along with its sister Below the Salt, is my favorite album of all time.  These two albums are a part of who I am.  I have enjoyed a lot of different music over the years, but like I have my whole life (literally), I can always come back to this great music by Steeleye Span.Once again, all the songs are traditional, with some of the music written by members of the band.  ""Alison Gross"" tells a story of a witch bribing a man to be her lover, but he won't and she makes him sorry.  The instrumental ""Robbery with Violins"" showcases the talents of bassist Rick Kemp and violinist Peter Knight.  ""Hares On The Mountain"" is a beautiful tune, reminiscent of ""The Ash Grove,"" and old Welsch Air.  ""The Ups and Downs"" is yet another tale of the loss of virginity.  The words to ""Cam Ye O'er Frae France"" may not be fully understood at first (I've been listening to this for my whole life, and I still don't know all of the lyrics), because they are sung in a Scottish toungue, and the booklet prints the words spelled as they are pronounced.  ""One Misty Moisty Morning"" is a great story of romance, while ""The Wee Wee Man"" is a great magical fairy tale.""  ""The Weaver and the Factory Maid"" is arguably vocalist Maddy Prior's greatest performance to date.  The harmonies on this track will blow your mind.  The band is also very tight on this track, as they are on many others as well.  ""Rogues In a Nation"" showcases the groups excellent skill at ensemble singing, backed only by a bass drum.Along with ""Below The Salt,"" this album marks a major part of who I am.  Whenever I can't think of anything else to listen to, I can always go back to the music of Steeleye Span.  I would recommend this album to anyone wanting to hear great traditional music.  If you buy this, also buy ""Below the Salt,"" they both go well together and are virtually one album.  When I become a father, I will definitely make sure that this music fills the ears of my children, enriching their lives as it did mine.5/5 Along with &quot;Below the Salt,&quot; &quot;Parcel of Rogues&quot; must be considered Steeleye Span's finest work. The band still sounds like a  folk string band at this point (they added a drummer on their next release,  &quot;Now We Are Six&quot;), but they use amplification where appropriate  and verge on having a pop feel.  The individual cuts on the album are all  excellent, especially 'The Weaver and the Factory Girl' (with a stunning  performance by Maddy Prior), and 'Alison Gross,' a good bad witch story if  there ever was one.  This album was a success when it was released and  still sounds fresh to my ears, in part due to the band's uncanny  arrangement talents. Comparisons between Steeleye Span and Fairport Convention are fairly common, and the voice of lead singer Maddy Prior is reminiscent of Sandy Denny. Both bands blend traditional British folk material with rock arrangements into an inventive and alluring mix. The musical basis of all Steeleye Span's albums is traditional Irish folk, but Parcel Of Rogues rocks (comparatively). The electric guitar work has plenty of pizzazz: see the ""funky"" bass lines on the instrumental `Robbery with Violins,' and the potent fingering on `Alison Gross.' Maddy Prior is particularly stunning on `One Misty Moisty Morning' and `The Weaver and the Factory Maid.' For beautiful vocal harmonies, `The Ups and Downs' and `Rogues in a Nation' are top picks. My favorite is the acoustic and cheerful `Hares on the Mountain.' For those who believe that Fairport Convention (yes, Richard Thompson is a master musician) is the preeminent British Folk-Rock group, give Parcel of Rogues a try. I suspect that you too will be taken in by their charms. This is without a doubt one of my all time favorite LP's.  I use the phrase LP because I own it on vinyl and have since it came out.  I did not buy it on Amazon but am going to purchase the box set that includes this disc.  In grade school music class we actually sang ""One Misty Moisty Morning"" and when I heard this on an LP I was hooked.  First song I heard by the group was ""Alison Gros"" and hearing heavy metal folk was unusual then.  My favorite on this still is the title track.  Great harmonies with only a mournful drum to back them.  The rest of the tracks are awesome and for those who like their rock a little different then this is a disc you should buy. I actually bought this as a gift for my mother, who has been looking for it elsewhere with no success. I have to say that I personally don't think it's as good as some of their other albums, but my mother is extremely happy with it and makes sure everyone who visits her, gets the opportunity to hear it. So, if I were my mother I would have to rate this with 5 BIG stars. Had the record years ago and brought back great memories.  Easy to order, arrived quickly and in perfect condition...I'm happy. If you've just started listening to Steeleye Span and love them, than this is a great album for you. With songs that you never believe you heard like the awesome ""Allison Gross"", and river dancing numbers like ""Come Yae O're Frae France"" that wil have you panting when the song is over, Parcel of Rogues is a great one to have even if you like groups like Yes, which are totally irrelevent to what Steeleye Does. The 2, 3, 4, or even 5 part harmonies are simply enchanting.I wish they had kept Gay Woods, a concertina player from the first album and Martin Carthy, an excellent singer/guitarist. That would have been seven people, but who cares? It would be awesome. I think that adding Nigel Pegrum, a drummer, to the band helped the band and hurt them. Before he came along, they relied on amazing mellodies, their songs were more acoustic. When they got Pegrum, they were forced to turn far more electric than they planned. Some people say that he is a bad drummer, but I disagree. He plays what he needs to.Get this with Below the Salt or All Around my Hat. You won't regret it... Okay, I like almost every song on this album.  YouTube lets me preview just about everything I buy these days...  I am a sucker for Misty Moisty Morning..., and Cam Ye O'er Frae France. Although this CD is obviously recording from the album and not a digital remix, it is still the music we know and love from Steeleye Span. This album was another step in my own odyssey from whatever i was to dedicated folk-rock fan.I was drowsing along one day in 1973 or so, headphones on while i did some homework so as not to disturb my Techwood  dorm roommate, when WREK played &quot;The Weaver and the Factory  Maid&quot;.I remember thinking that it was rather pretty... and then it  came to the bit near the end where Maddie multi-multi tracks a capella  vocals of the final chorus.  That's pretty and a little spooky on ordinary  speakers, when you're familiar with it.  Hearing it for the very first  time, on headphones, with All! Of! Those! Voices! inside my head, as it  were, was almost an epiphany.After contacting the station to discover  just who the heck that was and what the title was, i proceeded to buy a  copy the next day, and discovered that i liked Steeleye Span as much as i  liked Fairport Convention, who i had discovered in a similar fashion... and  it was another step on that long road for me...As to the content of the  album -- &quot;Misty Moisty Morning&quot; makes lovely use of Maddie's  voice.  &quot;Alison Gross&quot; is a nicely spooky story about a witch who  craves a young lover.  I'm still not sure what it means when one  &quot;...lives at the sign of the Ups and Downs...&quot;, but it's a neat  little song.&quot;Cam Ye O'er Frae France&quot; is a bit of scurrilous  anti-Hanoverian propaganda, accusing King George of whore-mongering, and  &quot;Rogues In a Nation&quot; is a heart felt lament by a Scots patriot at  the anticlimactic union of Scotland with England fro economic reasons:  &quot;What force or guile could not essay, O'er many warlike ages/Is  wrought now by a coward few, for hireling traitors' wages...&quot;And  &quot;The Weaver and the Factory Maid&quot; is Simply Lovely.  ((As a  footnote -- when i got to speak to Maddie at a show she did here in Atlanta  a few years ago and asked her just how many tracks she laid down on that  last chorus, she couldn't remember...)) ""Parcel of Rogues"" was my first Steeleye Span album, purchased at a time when folk-rock peaked, and many music enthusiasts were looking for alternatives to Fairport Convention.Seen in the back mirror, I think that ""Parcel of Rogues"" is the Steeleye Span album which have aged most gracefully. The melodies are all among their best, and there is great and refreshing variation in arrangement and style. It's obviously still relying on old traditional songs which are enlivened in new arrangements and added a little electricity - at this point there was still no drummer with the group.Many songs could be highlighted, but I will settle with commneting on only some of them. The opening track ""One Misty Moisty Morning"" is a fresh catchy song that serves well to capture the listener's attention from the start - obesides it has a  great instrumental break. Next track ""Alison Gross"" is probably the heaviest and most electric number on the album - the song may be seen as an arrow pointing out the direction of where the group was going.""The Bold Poachers"" is a beautifully melodic ballad with one of the male members on lead vocals. The magnificent a capella song, ""Rogues in a Nation"" caould be described as the album's title track, and in any case one of the really big numbers by the band.The final two tracks ""Can Ye O'ver Frae France"" and ""Hares on the Mountain"" nicely show how broad group spans. The former is an easy up-beat song beautifully performed by Maddy Prior, while ""Hares on the Mountain"" is a waltzy ballad, sung by one of the male members.Do you only wish to own a single album with the group, I would recommend this at any time. My main motive for penning this is to steer the potential reader/listener/buyer toward Steeleye Span's true masterpiece which is 'Below The Salt', the album they released before this. Although 'Parcel Of Rogues' contains some great moments, (as always, Maddy Prior's voice is a revelation and 'Rogues In A Nation' is a great song with wonderful group harmonies), this album is also hampered with some truly dire moments like the execrable 'Alison Gross' and 'The Wee Wee Man.' I fail to understand why this release is uniformly hailed as the best Steeleye Span record. 'Below The Salt' has so much more to recommend it. There is nothing quite like its authentic atmosphere of cavernous medieval acid folk rock. The human race can be divided into two groups; those who have heard 'Saucy Sailor' and those who have not. So save your pennies for 'Below The Salt', people, and get on with it. I have been listening to Steeleye Span since the mid-1970's, when they performed often in Seattle. This album is one of their two best, in my opinion; the other being _Below the Salt_. Having Scottish ancestors, I am particularly taken by the song ""Parcel of Rogues"", a dirge lamenting the loss of Scotland's national identity to become part of England. Some of the songs on this album are versions of some of the ""English and Scottish Popular Ballads [Child]"", like ""Alison Gross"" [Child Ballad 35]; some are versions of non-Ballad folk songs, like ""Hares on the Mountain"".Steeleye Span are not ""traditional"" folk singers. They are not purists about the way they sing the songs; and use musical instruments that hadn't been invented when some of these songs were first sung. That does not keep me from enjoying them. I reccommend this album to those who enjoy filk music as well as ""semi-traditional"" folk fans. Steeleye Span is fun; enjoy them. There are 4 songs on the album that are so good in this venue I wondered why they never got to be a more well known group in the USA. Some stuff should have been left out of this album or replaced with better songs. Probably the most direct and accessible of Steeleye Span's many fine albums, this starts out in fine style with the sprightly &quot;One Misty Moisty Morning&quot; - Maddy in typically powerful and melodic voice, solid support from the band and Bob Johnson providing some of the most elegant wah-wah guitar this side of Jimi Hendrix. &quot;Alison Gross&quot; is even rockier, crunching riffs and howling lead guitar...a more focussed cousin to the scary &quot;King Henry&quot; from &quot;Below the Salt&quot;. This album is not just a guitar showcase, however, as Maddy contributes an amazing vocal tour de force on &quot;The Weaver &amp; the Factory Maid&quot; - in fact she is unstoppably brilliant throughout. Rick Kemp's bass is well up in the mix - check out &quot;Robbery with Violins&quot;, and Tim Hart is still there to add some more subtle touches: &quot;The Bold Poachers&quot; would not be out of place on one of Tim &amp; Maddy's own albums. &quot;Rogues in a Nation&quot; is a weary song of proud resignation which highlights the group's fine ensemble singing, but the predominant tone of this album is relatively upbeat - my personal favourite being the energetic and amusing &quot;Ups and Downs&quot;. Definitely one to sit back and enjoy - play it LOUD! While I loved One Misty Moisty Morning, Cam Ye Oer from France, the others are less than great, except for Maddy's magnificent voice.  I too suggest Below the Salt, as well as Please to See the King, which is just beautiful. Steeleye Span is iconic among the 70s bands that took traditional English folk music and transformed it by setting it to a rock beat and playing it with electrical instruments.  Of all their albums, ""Parcel of Rogues"" is itself a classic -- or at least, the one I remember most vividly from my college days.  This CD brought back many memories.  Even for first-time listeners, it contains a number of real gems, from ""Alison Gross,"" a ballad about ""the ugliest witch in the North Country"" who tries to seduce an unwilling young man (with a horror-surprise ending!), to the title song, ""Parcel of Rogues in a Nation,"" which sets to music a poem by Robert Burns protesting the political merging of Scotland with England in the late 18th century, to the enigmatic ""Cam Ye O'er Fra France,"" another political song expressing support for the exiled Stuart king by denigrating the Hannoverian George I. Even if you're not a history buff, you'll enjoy the rollicking tunes and, of course, Maddy Prior's heavenly voice. When I was young (years ago) I tried to buy Steeleye Span at a local record store.  I had a nice long argument with a clerk who kept correcting me and saying that I wanted ""Steely Dan"" and that I was confused.  I was not confused and I still like Steeleye Span.  Along with Figgy Duff, and Loreena McKennitt these are me favorite CD's I first saw Steeleye Span when they were the opening act at a concert I saw may years ago.  They opened for Jethro Tull, of whom I am a huge fan.  Given those circumstances, I have always pigeonholed them as a type of progressive rock.  As JT does, Steeleye Span blends English folksong material with modern instrumentation and puts their own spin on it.  They are highly effective in the way they do it and take music that is centuries old and breath new life into it.During the period in which Steeleye Span recorded Parcel of Rogues (POR) they were just beginning to bring the drumset into the group.  They had, I believe, not used a modern drumset in any recordings up until POR was released.  The drumming in this recording is adequate to support the need of the music, but feels a bit stiff from time to time.  If there is a weak aspect of the album, that is it.The great strength of Steeleye Span lies in the voice of Maddy Prior.  I can not find words to describe the beauty inherent in her voice.  There are songs in the album where some of the men in the band take on the lead vocal and are at times quite convincing, but they are mere mortals when compared to Maddy.There are a couple of songs that I consider filler.  The first is a fiddle driven piece called Robbery With Violins.  It is okay, but sounds overproduced.  It is almost infectious, but somehow, I can't exlain why, it just barely misses the mark for me.  Then there is the final track, Hares On The Montain.  One of the men in the band takes the lead and the song itself, while memorable, seems flat because it is surrounded by other songs that are truly wonderful.  So, two songs and the drumming are less than perfect.Now the good stuff.  One Misty Moist Morning, Allison Gross and The Wee Wee Man are all 'rockers' for lack of a better term.  Even though the songs are based in old English tales, the band has turned the amps up, added drums and given their 'sound' more edge.  These are all solid fun songs.  The standout is the opener One Misty Moist Morning.  It opens with the fiddle and as soon as Maddy Prior comes in you can tell that you're about to hear something special.What I consider the stellar songs on the album are: The Bold Poachers, The Ups And Downs, Rogues In A Nation and Cam Ye O'er Frae France.  All these strongly harken back to the bands English roots. One of the men takes the lead vocal on The Bold Poachers while Maddy sings backup.  This is the best example of male lead on POR and it is a stirring song.  The Ups And Downs is plain fun.  Rogues In A Nation is again a stirring English folk song that has many things in common with, what I consider to be the best song in this group, Cam Ye O'er Frae France.  Cam Ye O'er From France portrays the oppression of the powerless and their cry for justice; (think Biko by Peter Gabriel).The tour de force of the album is The Weaver And The Factory Maid.  It is bouncy in rhythm until the ending section which is an acapella muti-tracked journey to whatever is closest to heaven on this earth. In this song, Maddy Prior's voice is displayed with power and beauty.  During the verses she sings, what is a very fast and intricate song, with precision and artistry.  As she comes to the end of each verse she 'leans into' the final note and drives the verse home.  One of my most moving experiences as a music lover comes at the end section of this song.  Ms. Prior sings each part of this who-knows-how-many-parts harmony.  It is splendid, wonderful, perfection.Buy this album and treat yourself.  If you end up skipping one or two of the songs to get to The Weaver And The Factory Maid, it will be worth it. Although I'm always keen for artists to progress, I must admit that I found the opening tracks a little too much at first in 1973. On subsequent listens, however, my fears were allayed - it's a corker! Can't agree with  the fuss about &quot;Robbery With Violins&quot; - listen to Rick Kemp on  bass. A word of warning, though: Shanachie reissues are notoriously  ordinary. As this record has always had a trebly sound, you don't need it  sounding any harsher. I got this and the just as good (if not better)  &quot;Below The Salt&quot; as BGO (UK)  remasters. While not  state-of-the-art, they are very good. In my opinion, their second best behind ""Below the Salt"", but this one contains ""Alison Gros"" my favorite Steeleye Span song. There are some excellent tracks on this album. `The Wee Wee Man` is one of my personal favourites and I prefer it to the oft-praised `Alison Gross` which is a tad overrated, in my humble opinion.  `Misty Moisty Morning`, `The Weaver and the Factory Maid` &amp; `Robbery With Violins` are the other standout tracks, for me.  The rest of the album is good, but not what I`d consider *compelling* listening.  I think the guitar on `Cam Ye O`er Frae France` is grating and incongruous and I think that the band themselves might agree, as later live recordings of this song sound a lot better.  Like other 70s Steeleye albums, Parcel of Rogues is a mix of the inspired and the mediocre.  Some of the tracks are SO good that the rest seem a bit dull in comparison.  Commoners Crown, Now We Are Six, and Rocket Cottage are other examples of this. The three most balanced albums of the era were-`Below the Salt`, `All Around My Hat`, &amp; `Storm Force Ten`. I've listened to Steeleye Span for thirty years now, and Maddy Prior's voice just gets better and better -- as does this album.  It's as fresh now as it was when I was in high school.  Alison Gross still knocks me out.

490,925,B000000E7K,"June Tabor's voice is rich, beautiful, and extremely well suited to the material. Fans of traditional folk music will love this CD. Excellent! This is a great CD with wonderful traditional songs from the British Islands. The arrangements are great. I love June Tabor's voice and the instrumentation is also great. June Tapor's heavy old english accent only serves to enhance these classic folk songs. The music is pure and simple and elegant. This is Tabor's debut album and in many ways, hard to top.  She's defined her style here:  lush vocalization with ascetic arrangements.  I think she does Eric Bogle better than Bogle himself.  Her version of ""The Band Played Waltzing Matilda"" is the best I have heard.  She tackles out of the way topics with her own flair. ""Pull Down Lads"" talks of the crew of carnies who close a fair down.  Her ""Waly Waly"" (""The Water is Wide"" is also not-to-be missed.

491,926,B000000E7L,"I am not quite sure what happened by just after the birth of my second child i started feeling the need to expand my musical collection with new genre's.  Folk and Jazz were it and I realy enjoy the acessability of this cd and they ease at which you can hum/sing along and its ability to make you smile and uplift your spirtis.  I have now started to collect Steeleye and Fairport Convention and htey fit well inot my collection.  The only other folky type music i ever liked liked was Melanie but this is almost as good. I love Irish music. This is the best. Everytime I listen to the album I enjoy it more. Maddy is a wonderful talented singer who makes it come alive in the best ways possible. I can't really agree with some of what one of the other reviewers (Mr. Morley) makes of this Steeleye Span album.  Almost everyone else agrees that &quot;Parcel of Rogues&quot; and &quot;Below the Salt&quot; are far and away their best albums; &quot;All Around My Hat&quot; irritated a lot of people in the folk community when it came out for its rather blatant attempt at crossover at the expense of ground already gained.  That said, neither can one really criticize the results in absolute terms.  Pryor's voice *does* sound great, the title cut *was* a hit, and the material does stand up reasonably.  But the arrangements are less interesting and more pop-like than either the albums that preceded or followed it, giving one a greater feeling of sell-out than planned exploration.  I've actually always preferred the rather less-known &quot;Rocket Cottage,&quot; which followed it, but that's not available now.  Perhaps the most that can be said about &quot;All Around My Hat&quot; is that it was an experiment that succeeded commercially yet ended up alienating the group's core following, which remained folk-oriented rather than pop-oriented. This album contains many of my favorite steeleye span music.  If you are not familiar with this type of music they are old folk tunes played with some modern  upbeats referred to as folk rock.  I am not a musician and can only tell you I love their mix of ballads and stories with musical stories that make me smile, from a time when TV did not dominate and innuendo, scandals, stories  and rumors were spread by traveling minstrels.  But they took what might have seemed dated offkey folk songs and added more modern musical background and lovely voices of the lead singers.  Maybe not for everybody but eclectic enough to find some true fans who don't want to listen to top forty, jazz. opera, classical but are seeking something slightly different. All aound my hat is truely one of Steeleye's best. The album kicks off with ""Black Jack Davy"", a wonderful, amazing swithc off between male and female vocals. The Highlights include ""The Wife of Ushers Well"", a beautiful 3 part harmony (I have a live version where they use five part harmony), and ""All Around my Hat"", which is basically a jig with lyrics. Even while riding in a car I can't help but dance to the lively rythm. I bet Maddy Prior was dancing in the recording studio when she recorded this song. You would have to be a pretty sour square not to like ""All Around My Hat"". It's a great album. Trust Me! (I'm under twelve years old) Great CD, I miss them...  Used to listen to them quite a bit when I still had a 33 1/3 record player hooked up.  Not everything has been converted to CD... Steeleye Span / All Around My Hat:  British folk done Rock style.  This is a wonderful and entertaining CD.  Listening to this album is pure joy.  Five Stars. This would have to be one of my favourite albums. The title track is an old 19th Century Folk Song which is given a modern flavour yet stil retains its origins thanks to Maddy Prior's exquisite vocals and her talented band of musicians. Since buying this album I have colected every Steeleye Span CD that I could get my hands on and was very happy to learn that Maddy Prior went on to achieve success as a solo artist. This band's unique sound will enthrall and and capture the listener. It's like when Dylan went electric-the folk purists couldn't handle it.  Yes, ""All Around My Hat"" is a somewhat more commercial album, but when the singing, harmonies, instrumentation, and the songs themselves are so great, that's what endures.  It's pretty hard not to sing along with the title track or ""Hard Times of Old England.""  ""Cadwith Anthem"" has great singing as in similar tunes on past Steeleye albums.  The drumming that one hears had been introduced a few albums back, so what's the big deal?  The essence of the group, the fine instrumentation, and the spirited singing from Maddy Prior all remain on this album. Whether it is the place to start is a matter of opinion, but this recording rightly takes its place among those the group can be proud of. ""All Around My Hat"" from 1975 was Steeleye Span's follow-up album to the artistically very successful ""Commoner's Crown"". A new producer, Mike Batt, had been hired and there is generally a harder and less polished sound on this album. ""All Around My Hat"" was the be the band's best selling album. The title-track single was also their most succesful hit-single reaching number 7 on the UK charts.The songs are mostly new band compositions to old traditional lyrics, a concept the band had followed for some years at this point. Like on ""Commoners Crown"" the songwriting is generally great, with great melodies such as ""Wife of Usher's Well"", ""Black Jack Davy"",  ""Bachelors Hall"" and of course ""All Around My Hat"".""Hard Times of Old England"" is a traditional tune in the same boogie beat as the title track, and almost as catchy. ""Cadgwith Anthem"" is another traditional tune, performed in Steeleye Span's wellknown and impressive a capella style.A few tracks come out slightly light weight, which is the reason that I don't rate the album quite as highly as ""Commoners Crown"" and ""Parcel of Rogues""; but it's still easily worth five stars. The first time I heard Steeleye Span was in 1976 when &quot;Hard Times of Old England&quot; exploded out of the radio speaker. The station was WBLM, back when they were an outstanding radio station. NOTHING I had ever heard on the radio before or since ever left me so impressed with an unknown (to me) artist/band. Immediately purchase the record and practically wore it out. Subsequently I ended up owning all their albums and grew to know and love them all.  All Around My Hat is the essential &quot;desert island album&quot; The combination of upbeat folk/rock, hard driving powerful musicianship, and stunning ballads with equally stunning vocals by Maddy Prior and Company make for a varied and very interesting album. The carping by &quot;purists&quot; that Steeley Span abandoned their folk roots with this album is not a legitimate critique as true artists should and will experiment and sometimes the result is an outstanding album such as this one. My recommendation is to purchase All Around My Hat and then give a listen to Below the Salt, Rocket Cottage, Please to See the King, and Parcel of Rogues. You will be hooked for life and will want to own every note Steeleye Span ever recorded. Why have most people never heard this band? It's a tragedy! In spite of the opinion of the editorial review that you'll find earlier on this page this album deserves greater recognition for its good points.  This was my initial Steeleye Span purchase.  I first heard &quot;All Around  My Hat&quot; on KISW in Seattle, Washington late one night and immediately  fell in love with Maddy Prior's voice (I've still got the tape of that  original broadcast.)  Purchase of the album the next day (sometime in 1975  if memory serves) proved to me that my initial impression was correct.  Maddy's wonderful soprano comes through beautifully on this album and it  will make any listener sit up and take notice.If nothing else this album  is a wonderful way to introduce others, particularly people with a  rock'n'roll background, to English folk music.  In spite of the adverse  commentary of the editorial I find that this album stands up very well  against other Steeleye Span albums (and I have all of them.)  The lyricism  of &quot;Old England&quot; or &quot;Gamble Gold (Robin Hood)&quot; is also  to be found on other Steeleye Span albums, including earlier ones such as  _Hark The Village Wait_, with it's wonderful, indeed haunting, version of  &quot;Dark Eyed Sailor.&quot;Going to the other end of the spectrum is  the strictly instrumental &quot;Sum Waves (Tunes).&quot;  It's arrangement  is simple, in keeping with the instrumentation, and certainly worth the  time it takes to listen to it.  In like manner &quot;Cadgwith Anthem&quot;  is done largely a cappela (there are some horns mixed in for the last  verse), hardly the overly orchestrated, poorly mixed tune that the  editorial writer would have you believe make up this album.Suffice it to  say that this album belongs in any Steeleye Span fan's collection.  Also,  if you have no other Steeleye Span album, this is the one to have.  If  you're at all like me you'll end up with all the wonderful albums from this  very talented, if much overlooked and misunderstood, group of eclectic  Englishpersons.  The music has held up extremely well with the passing  years and I am sure that it will continue to do so. Steeleye Span is incomparable.  Listen to more than one song and you'll find their music captivation.  Reminds me of the old wandering minstrels. This album sounds like a glossier version of a &quot;Liege and Lief&quot;-era Fairport Convention.  Maddy Prior and whichever of the guitarists is doing the male lead vocals (my CD has lyrics, but no band or song credits) both have fine strong voices, and remind me more than a little of Fairport's Denny and Swarbrick.  Although several songs have been decked out with orchestration, it doesn't overwhelm the band like on a Renaissance album.  On &quot;Batchelors Hall&quot;, the big wall of strings on the chorus makes the vocals seem fuller.  The production is crisp, and the playing and harmonies are fine without being showy.  I like my folk-rock to lean toward rock, and this album doesn't disappoint.  &quot;All Around My Hat&quot;, &quot;Hard Times of Old England&quot;, and &quot;Dance with Me&quot; are all lively danceable tunes.  &quot;Black Jack Davy&quot; is an adultery song reminiscent of &quot;The Raggle Taggle Gypsy&quot; or &quot;Matty Groves&quot;.  &quot;Gamble Gold&quot; describes a fight between Robin Hood and his cousin, while &quot;Dance with Me&quot; cheerfully recounts an elf princess' attempt to seduce a knight.  This is my first Steeleye Span CD, and it's given me a taste for more.","Folk Rock,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,British Folk,World Music,Rock,Folk",quite sure happened birth second child started feeling need expand musical collection new genres folk jazz realy enjoy acessability cd ease hum sing along ability make smile uplift spirtis started collect steeleye fairport convention htey fit well inot collection folky type ever liked liked melanie almost good love irish best everytime listen enjoy maddy wonderful talented singer makes come alive best ways possible cant really agree one reviewers mr morley makes steeleye span almost everyone else agrees quot parcel rogues quot quot salt quot far away best quot around hat quot irritated lot people folk community quite sure happened birth second second child child started feeling expand musical musical collection collection new genres folk folk jazz jazz enjoy cd ease hum sing sing along ability smile uplift started collect convention fit collection folky type liked liked good good love love irish best listen enjoy maddy wonderful talented singer come come alive alive best best ways ways possible really agree reviewers mr morley steeleye span span agrees quot parcel rogues quot salt quot far away best quot hat quot irritated lot people folk community
492,927,B000000E7M,"Steeleye Span's previous effort, Parcel of Rogues is one truly amazing folk rock album, to me, it's a classic. After that album came out, a prog rock group by the name of Gnidrolog had just broken up, after releasing two albums, Lady Lake and In Spite of Henry's Toenail. That band featured drummer Nigel Pegrum, and he joined Steeleye Span. That gave the band a full-time drummer for the first time, and was put in to good use with Now We Are Six. The band was now starting to use more rock-oriented material, like ""Thomas the Rhymer"" and the ever wonderful ""Seven Hundred Elves"". Their version of the Teddy Bears' (the band Phil Spector was in) 1958 hit ""To Know Him is to Love Him"", the one with David Bowie playing sax, seems totally out of place on a Steeleye Span album, sounding more like New York circa 1958 than Merry Olde England circa 1558. Many Steeleye Span fans were obviously distressed over the inclusion of such a song. But luckily there's several great medieval sounding cuts to keep the old fans happy. Like ""Two Magicians"", ""Edwin"", and ""The Mooncoin Jig"". Why on Earth did they include a version of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star""? After all it's a song everyone has learned to hate since Kindergarten. This version features kids from the St. Eleye Primary School singing that song and played exactly in the style you remember at school, with a teacher playing the piano and getting the kids to sing. I can live without that (and it seems everyone else too). Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull fame is production consultant, and his involvement with this album is a big reason how he got Maddy Prior to sing backup on Tull's ""Too Old To Rock and Roll: Too Young To Die"" a couple of years later, not to mention a big reason for the very medieval sound of Songs From the Wood. To me, I find Now We Are Six a bit uneven, but I still find it better than their largely flat-sounding followup, Commoner's Crown. Still, if you're new to Steeleye Span, try any of their albums from Hark! The Village Wait to Parcel of Rogues first. Twinkle twinkle little Star?Must have been the Wine or good Grass?Great CD but the last 2 tracks and the Title track should be avoided at all costs.It's a shame a possible classic is wasted.Remaining tracks are well worth getting the CD though.Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) had something to do with the production of this CD. Steeleye Span are wonderful musicians that deliver unique music. Maddy prior has a beautiful strong voice and loads of talent. Well worth the price of the album. In truth, this album is the epitome of the elves-and-druids prog-folk that folks made fun of back in the day... Bouncy hard-rock electric bass lines crisscross with sprightly mandolins and a full drum set and electric guitars.  It's not subtle musicmaking, nor was it intended to be... Instead, it's a call to playtime, a resolutely silly recess from the dire and hard-edged heavy rock of the times.  Whether one saw this as a breath of fresh air or a poofy distraction depended, I suppose, on temprament or a high tolerance for dorky behavior.  For my money, the formula was still working... Although the band wasn't quite able to regain the heights of the &quot;Parcel of Rogues&quot; album, Maddy Prior's voice is heavenly, and the songs all hold together, despite the goofy overtones.  Definitely worth checking out. Yeah, there's no way to deny it: ""To Know Him Is to Love Him"" and ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" are serious double-you tee eff moments (though it's hard for me to believe people actually fell for the notion that they were performed by elementary school students--I mean, ""St. Eleye?""  Come on).  I know some people would also put the title track in this category, but I can't really agree with that--consisting of several Old English-style riddles put to music, I find it nice and evocative.  But those other two--um, no.  Extremely missable by any standard.But never mind them--look at what this album DOES do right.  The opener ""Thomas the Rhymer"" is  always fun, with a nice, adventurous arrangement.  And it's really funny to me to picture Thomas bowing down and going ""Hail, Queen of Heaven!"" while the faerie queen's going, um, dude.  No.  It's true that the story doesn't really GO much of anywhere, but the song is still very much worthwhile.""Drink Down the Moon"" is also pretty great; it's a slow, melancholic song with sort of mysterious lyrics, that towards the end takes a left turn by segueing into the rollicking--and totally delightful--""The Cuckoo,"" which features one of my favorite bits of innuendo in any Span song: ""It is thorn and it is prickle, it is compassed all around/It is thorn and it is prickle and it isn't easy found/She said young man you blunder and he said it isn't true/And then left her with the makings of a young cuckoo.""Then there the ever-popular ""Two Magicians.""  This song is especially good when you realize what the band's done with it.  What I take to be the original version, as performed by Martin Carthy, is a sort of queasy song of sexual conquest--but the Span version is much ""nicer""--sweet, even; the male magician comes across as being much less predatory, and the whole thing has more the feel of an elaborate flirtation than an aggressive pursuit.Passing over the previously-mentioned ""Now We Are Six,"" we come to ""Seven Hundred Elves,"" which I'm kind of dubious about.  You'd think a duel between humans and elves would be super-fun, but ultimately, I really don't think it's very compelling, and it's not at all clear whether the farmer is actually supposed to be sympathetic or not.  Was the band aiming to make the song into some sort of oblique environmental anthem?  Regardless, it doesn't do much for me.  ""Long-A-Growing""--performed by Carthy, Pentangle, and others under the rather more poetic title ""The Trees They Do Grow High,"" is better, but it's not a favorite, either--I'd have to say I like Pentangle's take on it best.  ""The Mooncoin Jig"" is an okay-not-fantastic instrumental.  Fortunately, then we come to the gleefully-macabre murder ballad that is ""Edwin,"" which is one of the band's all-time classics.  Seriously great singing, and it's difficult not to smile in particular at the almost gratuitously grim final lines: ""And Emma broken-hearted was to Bedlam forced to go/Her shrieks were for young Edwin/That plowed the lowlands low.""  Whee!  Sing a merry song!Then, unfortunately, we're back to ""To Know Him"" and ""Twinkle""--but who cares?  With ""Drink Down the Moon, ""Two Magicians,"" and ""Edwin,"" this album contains three of the band's best songs, and other than the two closers, the others ain't half bad either.  This may not be the ideal first Span purchase (Below the Salt), but it's a typically-solid entry in the band's seventies catalogue.  Recommended. Now we are Six is kind of a cheesy album, especially with ""Twinkle, Twinkle"". I think they just wanted to fill up extra time with that song. This is the first album with Nigel Pegrum, the controversial drummer. He thus makes the band six people, this being their sixth album as well. Ian Anderson of Tull produces it, and he did a good job.""Thomas the Rhymer""is good, (It reminds me of some eighties rock band)and I'll have you know I know quite a bit about my good friend Thomas. He was a fictional poet who was a leading poet on faeries. Apparently, he expirienced them in daily life. Also a great song, ""Drink Down the Moon"", with a sad mellody sang by Maddy Prior, in my opinion the best prog. rock vocalist of all time, extends over six minutes, but hey- they needed the time. ""The Mooncoin Jig"", a happy number that starts off with, ""One, Two, Three"", said by Pete Knight, featured mandolin player on the song. ""Seven Hundred Elves"" is a prog rock classic, with long vocal solos sung by Maddy. My mom says it's drug music, but she's wrong. To many die-hard Steeleye fans, Now We Are Six marked a turn for the worse in their music.  With their decision to start using &quot;modern&quot; instruments such as electric guitars and synthesizers, and to use murky sound and dark subject matter in their choice of songs, Steeleye Span created an album that was not nearly as pleasing as their previous attempts.  Happily, this import version makes some much-needed improvements.  The sound quality is noticably better, which helps to make the songs easier to appreciate.  But the real gem is the extended, six-minute plus version of Thomas the Rhymer - while the original American version is a throwaway bouncy pop tune, the import version contains extra lyrics which Maddy Prior delivers with delightful charm and delicacy.  This track alone makes it worth the revisit.  Throw your domestic copy of Six away and purchase this one! I don't necessarily like ALL of the songs on this compilation.  Thomas the Rhymer, Two Magicians and Seven Hundred Elves are my standouts.  Of course the Mooncoin Jig is pretty good too...;) I love &quot;Now We Are Six&quot;! I have several Steeleye Span albums, all of which I love, but I really like this one especially. I must admit I was surprised when I heard the electric guitars, but I think they really give it a cool effect. If you like this album (which is mostly old english songs to a modern beat), you'll probably like stuff by the Transiberian Symphony. The original album, which I have as vinyl and which is available through amazon.com as an import, contains a REALLY GOOD version of Thomas the Rhymer. This album contains a horrible travesty of the same song. For $... more, you can get an album that you'll treasure forever. I was extremely disappointed with this CD, and would not recommend to anyone that they buy it. Check out the reviews for the import version. They rave about the import, and tell folks to throw away the American version of the album if they have it. I could not agree more. The title ""Now We're Six"" refers to the fact that Steeleye Span on this album had expanded the line-up with drummer Nigel Pegrum, bringing the number of members of the group to six.The somewhat silly children's song ""Now We're Six"" which is featured on the album is hardly reason for choosing this particular title.It is obvious that the expansion with a drummer gave the group the opportunity to even more determinedly to continue to along rocking direction which was been taken with the two previous albums ""Below the Salt"" and ""Parcel of Rogues."" Especially on the albums strongest track ""Thomas the Rhymer"" this new potential comes to expression. Unfortunately, the choice of songs for this album is very uneven, and in fact only ""Thomas the Rhymer,"" ""Long a Growing"" and to a minor extend ""Drink Down the Moon"" continue the high standards of their  previous albums. The instrumental ""Mooncoin Jig"" is of course fine, but otherwise the rest of the album come silly or slightly uninspired.The two children's songs ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" and ""Now We're Six"" seem misplaced. The same applies to the old pop hit ""To Know Him is to Love Him"".""Edwin"" and ""Seven Hundred Elves"" are basically good and interesting stories, melodically just not very strong. It should be noted that the original album version of ""Thomas the Rhymer"" is the same edited version as on the single. A longer and even stronger version has been released released on some compilations. I think I might just be the only Steeleye fan who prefers the *short* verson of Thomas the Rhymer on this version of the CD. I`ve also got the BGO Records version of Now We Are Six, so I`m very familiar with the `album` version of the song. Personally, the album version doesn`t work for me, the way it slows right down, it drags a bit for me, whereas the short version, although maybe a tad TOO short, has a much nicer `feel` to it(it`s a different recording, as well as being shorter). The album version is the `common` version, the one the band always perform at gigs, and there are other versions of it on other CDs(The Journey, Rare Collection, bonus track on Park Record`s Sails of Silver) - so, for me, the short version has a uniqueness about it that the album version lacks. Anyway, enough of Thomas the Rhymer. ---- This album would qualify as vintage Steeleye if it wasn`t for the inclusion of drivel(IMHO) like Twinkle Twinkle, Now We Are Six, and To Know Him is to Love Him, a song that is completely incongruous and irrelevant to the album.By the way, the `St. Eleye Primary School Junior Choir` thing is a band `joke`, and one which they should have kept off the album.  I dunno, it probably seemed like a good idea at the time?!  It is actually Maddy Prior and the others singing.  Have another listen.  It had me fooled too, at first, until someone pointed it out to me.  St. Eleye = Steeleye.  And the `Miss Knight` on piano forte accompaniment is none other than MR. Peter Knight.","Folk Rock,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,British Folk,World Music,Rock,Folk",steeleye spans previous effort parcel rogues one truly amazing folk rock classic came prog rock group name gnidrolog broken releasing two lady lake spite henrys toenail band featured drummer nigel pegrum joined steeleye span gave band full time drummer first time put good use six band starting use rock oriented material like thomas rhymer ever wonderful seven hundred elves version teddy bears band phil spector hit know love one david bowie playing sax seems totally place steeleye span sounding like new york circa merry olde england circa many steeleye span fans obviously distressed inclusion luckily theres several great medieval sounding cuts keep old fans happy like two magicians edwin steeleye spans spans previous effort parcel rogues truly amazing folk folk rock rock classic came prog prog rock rock rock group group gnidrolog broken releasing lady lady lake lake spite henrys band featured drummer nigel pegrum joined steeleye span span band full full time time drummer time good band starting rock oriented material thomas thomas rhymer rhymer wonderful elves version teddy teddy bears bears band phil phil spector spector hit know love david bowie bowie playing sax seems totally place steeleye span span sounding new new york york circa merry england circa steeleye span span fans obviously distressed inclusion luckily great medieval sounding cuts keep old fans happy magicians

494,930,B000000E7Q,"On this album you hear Matt Molloy play a resonant, sonorouslow Bb flute and a brilliant, hornlike high Eb flute in addition to his regular D, giving a wonderful variety of timbres and textures to his playing.  In particular, his track of Drowsy Maggie on the Bb just lays back and cooks, and his &quot;Jenny's Chickens&quot; on the Eb is played with a brilliant brutality that any lover of the stronger, harsher sounds of the wooden flute will immediately want more of. Of Molloy's many recordings, this remains my favorite.  With his usual virtuosity, he performs a selection of traditional tunes ranging from the lively to the gently melancholy.  This album has a more consistent &quot;feel&quot; than most of his others:  there isn't an intense heartbreaker (like &quot;The Parting of Friends&quot; or &quot;O Rathaille's Grave&quot;), and even the jollier tunes are restrained.  But it's never dull:  the variety comes from the different timbres of his wooden flutes, and from the characteristic tones and harmonies of the accompaniment.  He's well supported here by his former Bothy Band colleagues Michael O Domhnaill (guitar) and Donal Lunny (bouzouki, synthesizer, et al.).  Molloy's phrasing is nothing short of marvelous:  the interaction between the instrument, the player, and the tune is nowhere any clearer than on a simple flute controlled by the life-energy of the breath.  Elsewhere he's compared playing the flute to walking a tightrope -- but on this album he doesn't merely walk, he dances.","Europe,Irish Folk,Ireland,Celtic Folk,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,Britain,World Music,Folk",hear matt molloy play resonant sonorouslow bb flute brilliant hornlike high eb flute addition regular giving wonderful variety timbres textures playing particular drowsy maggie bb lays back cooks quot jennys chickens quot eb played brilliant brutality lover stronger harsher sounds wooden flute immediately want molloys many recordings remains favorite usual virtuosity performs selection traditional tunes ranging lively gently melancholy consistent quot feel quot others isnt intense heartbreaker like quot parting friends quot quot rathailles grave quot even jollier tunes restrained never dull variety comes different timbres wooden flutes characteristic tones harmonies accompanim hear matt matt molloy molloy play resonant bb bb flute flute brilliant hornlike high eb eb flute flute addition regular wonderful variety timbres textures playing drowsy bb lays lays back cooks chickens quot eb played brilliant brutality lover stronger harsher sounds wooden wooden flute flute immediately want molloys recordings remains favorite usual virtuosity performs selection traditional tunes ranging lively gently melancholy consistent quot feel intense heartbreaker friends quot grave quot tunes restrained dull variety comes different timbres wooden wooden flutes flutes characteristic tones harmonies

497,933,B000000E7V,"I first heard June Tabor sing the music of this album live, at a little folk venue near my town.  The place holds about 200 people, but there were about 400 packed in to hear her, and the entire audience (including me) was rapt.  With only a sparse piano accompaniment, she was spellbinding.  These are moody, quiet songs but June's voice and presence hold your attention completely.  June is one of very few artists of folk music origin who can sing both traditional and contemporary tunes on the same album with equally high quality.  You don't have to be a folkie to love this music. This album was my first acquaintance with June Tabor's work. Chronologically it was an odd place to start, but it proved to be my everlasting favourite. From the titlesong 'Aqaba' with its Lawrence of Arabia references to a hauntingly beautiful yiddish song, to tributes to racing pidgeons, through murder ballads (as in 'The Banks Of Red Roses') - this is the folk record that touches many branches of our cultural tree.  And then there is the voice. It can dispense with any other instruments altogether, and in the precious moments it does so, there is such a rich contralto texture to it that it seems its vibrations are echoing within you. Your pulse follows its tempo. Your heart stirrs, soars, dies as the words gain new meanings when June sings them. This one is a must. A must. This might not be Ms. Tabor's most popular recording, but it's by far my favorite. The tone of the entire CD is quiet and melancholic -- the arrangements are simple, a perfect setting for Tabor's magnificent voice.I'm not necessarily one for sentimental songs, but tunes on this album like &quot;The King of Rome&quot; (about a poor man and his prized homing pigeon), &quot;Where Are You Tonight?&quot; (a plaintive cry to a lost love) and &quot;Seven Summers&quot; (about a child who looks forward to summer but misses out due to inclement weather) just break my heart.Just as good are the traditionally English-sounding numbers like &quot;The Reaper&quot; and &quot;The Banks of Red Roses,&quot; as well as an unforgettable Jewish song, &quot;Mayn Rue Plats&quot; (I'm not sure what it's about but the melody is haunting). And the title track about Lawrence of Arabia's dying moments is killer.Seriously, I have had to buy this album three times because every time I lend it out it doesn't come back. And I don't mind -- I love turning people on to this outstanding disk. June Tabor's vibratoless voice will haunt you. It seems to come from a well deep inside her soul. This collection of songs is hard to classify, she sings 10,000 Maniac's Verdi Cries and then moves onto a 19th century Yiddish dirge about the plight of sweatshop workers. The instrumentation is sparse, sometimes jazz, then folk and then silent as she sings acappella. At times I think of June Tabor as a troubadour and then she becomes a jazz crooner. I highly recommend her to fans of Joni Mitchell. Isn't she wonderful?  The title track is the one that gets everybody and it is really an amazing piece of music.  It captures the stark essence of T.E. Lawrence much better (in my opinion) than the movie soundtrack by Maurice Jarre (although that is a splendid score, it seems to have little to do with Lawrence the man).This album, almost unclassifiable due to its varied content, is an enduring classic, an intimate portrait of one of England's great folk singers.  Highly recommended! After a long hiatus during the 1980s, June Tabor decided to permanently abandon her career as a librarian as that decade drew to a close.Although she had shown herself a distinctive interpreter of songs both traditional and modern on her previous three full-length studio recordingsAirs and Graces,Ashes and DiamondsandAbyssinians, it was only with this amazing album that Tabor really showed herself to be the most singular of vocal talents.On ""Aqaba"", Tabor's voice remained recognisable from the early work of ""Airs And Graces"" but with age it had in a strange but fitting way grown deeper and very much darker. From the first track, she sounded sad yet always honest about what she was saying, most clearly on the beautiful, twinkling ""Where Are You Tonight, I Wonder"" and the amazing Martin Simpson-embellished title track, which as a piece of folk minimalism with only a few guitar notes and a soft bowed double bass. The jazzy Yiddish worksong ""Mayn Rue Platz"" showed her embracing the chamber jazz that would dominate her 1990s work, whilt the 10,000 Maniacs cover ""Verdi Cries"" was almost equally dark and truly despairing - not for fans of synthesised teen pop.The opener ""The Old Man's Song"" stands up to these two pieces, whilst on the untrained a capella ""Searching For Lambs"" showed Tabor to have not lost the beauty of ""The Band Played Waltzing Matilda"" off her first album.Dark, and folksy and jazzy by turns, the depth and sadness of June Tabor's contralto voice turned ""Aqaba"" into the last masterpiece of the English folk revival began by Anne Briggs 25 years before this came out. Tabor was to produce some winderful work onAngel TigerandAgainst The Streams, but that was totally outside the folk realm. Thus ""Aqaba"" stands as the last monument to the power and intimacy of English traditional folk songs.","Folk Rock,Contemporary Folk,Jazz,British & Celtic Folk,Celtic New Age,Pop,Traditional Folk,New Age,British Folk,World Music,Rock,Folk",first heard june tabor sing live little folk venue near town place holds people packed hear entire audience including rapt sparse piano accompaniment spellbinding moody quiet junes voice presence hold attention completely june one artists folk origin sing traditional contemporary tunes equally high quality dont folkie love first acquaintance june tabors work chronologically odd place start proved everlasting favourite titlesong aqaba lawrence arabia references hauntingly beautiful yiddish tributes racing pidgeons murder ballads banks red roses folk record touches many branches cultural tree voice heard june june tabor tabor sing live folk venue town place holds people packed hear entire audience including rapt sparse piano accompaniment spellbinding quiet junes voice presence hold attention completely june june one artists folk origin sing traditional contemporary tunes equally high high quality quality folkie love acquaintance june june tabors tabors work chronologically odd place start proved everlasting favourite aqaba arabia references hauntingly beautiful yiddish tributes racing pidgeons murder murder ballads ballads banks red red roses roses folk record touches branches cultural tree voice

501,937,B000000E8N,"I don't know how it took me sooo long to discover Seamus Eagan. I thought I was pretty well rounded musically, but this was a huge gap.  This guy can bring a tear to your eye on one track and have you up dancing naked around the Celtic bonfires of your ancestors on the next track!!  Then he fires up the -what is it, a 5 string banjo??- and you could be in Nashville!! Can it get any better?  Now I'm horrified to see this album's not available on Amazon.  People, you must find this album however you can. It's guaranteed to transport you out of this troubled world for just as long as you want. Modern edge blended with traditional Irish music style. Great!!  The title track is haunting and will be a favorite of the genre.  If you are looking for something Irish but not ""diddley aye"" this ones for you. Of the 13 instrumental tracks constituting Seamus Egan's WHEN JUNIPER SLEEPS, five are traditional songs arranged by Egan, two are original works by modern artists, and six are Egan's own original compositions.  About two-thirds of the selections are downtempo.There's no denying Seamus Egan's virtuosity with an impressive panoply of traditional instruments, and clearly this album moves many listeners; the effluence and articulateness of Egan's strings, in particular, is a sheer joy (e.g., the arrangements of ""Masons Apron"" and ""The Czar of Munster"").  Nonetheless, some listeners may not enjoy the overt sentimentality that pervades Egan's own compositions, whose very titles betray their mawkishness (""Weep Not for the Memories""; ""When Last We Met"").While the saccharine quality seems to predispose some of Egan's work to film soundtracks, affectation does not translate into great composition.  Egan was relatively young when he first published this album in 1996; one hopes that in the interim his message has matured to a level congruous with his impressive technical skill. I'm frankly shocked to see a tepid review of this album here. A friend bought this for me in 1997 and - surprising even me - it instantly became one of my top five albums of all time. On my iTunes, every track on this album is five stars. Its course runs the entire gamut of emotions - you'll know every tune by heart after just a couple listens...I don't know what happens, but it gets in your heart, not just your ears. I've turned more people on to this album than any other - and it doesn't matter what your ""typical"" musical style is. This album is accessible yet challenging, complex in its musicianship but straightforward in its melodies, and utterly brilliant. An absolute ""must have"" for every music collection. Once you listen to Seamus perform on any of the multitude of instruments that he is capable of playing, you'll understand the meaning of a musical prodigy. Seamus's music lives and breathes, far beyond the expert talent  required for speedy reels and jigs to soft moving airs. This album defines  Irish music that refuses to let go of your soul. His abilities are quite  simply beyond reproach. An absolute requirement for any Celtic music lover. Mr. Boycottam's review sums it up.  These melodies are nice, but heavy with too many instruments, too thick with tracks.  I was looking for Irish banjo music; this album is ""easy listening"". After hearing Seamus on the soundtrack for &quot;The Brothers McMullen&quot; , which features &quot;When Juniper Sleeps&quot;, a personal favorite, I became entranced. His uncanny ability to pair instruments together and blend their sounds together brings a feeling from inside that shows what music really is. His work on this album is amazing with songs like tracks 5 and 7, there may be nothing better. Seamus Egan starts off with his traditional Irish music genre, and on this CD, adds influences of New Age, jazz, Western swing, oh maybe Klezmer... I can hear sounds that remind me of Leo Kottke and Bela Fleck... this is very tasty listening music, well done and all the musicians play as well as Egan who is some kind of genius. I grin, thinking what kind of totally intense fanatic musician he must be! Yet nothing sounds driven or tense at all; this is thoroughly relaxing and can put you into a space resembling a great high quite without any of those ""substances"". Maybe this is so addictive that it should be illegal.Just don't buy it thinking you're going to hear pure traditional Irish music 'cuz it goes 'way beyond that. I too bought this CD many many years when I heard the Brothers McMullen Soundtrack and found that Seamus Egan far outshown a movie that was, unfortunately, fairly forgettable.  Mr. Egan plays so many of these instruments with a breeziness the belies their difficulty, making the listener think that it must be EASY to play that many instruments.  He certainly has a gift.  And if you are interested in traditional Celtic music or even Appalachian bluegrass, this album is a must buy.","Europe,Irish Folk,Contemporary Folk,Ireland,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,World Music,Folk",dont know took sooo long discover seamus eagan thought pretty well rounded musically huge gap guy bring tear eye one dancing naked around celtic bonfires ancestors next fires string banjo could nashville get better im horrified see available amazon people must find however guaranteed transport troubled world long want modern edge blended traditional irish style great title haunting favorite genre looking something irish diddley aye ones instrumental constituting seamus egans juniper sleeps five traditional arranged egan two original works modern artists six egans original compositions two thirds know sooo long discover seamus thought pretty rounded musically huge gap guy bring tear eye dancing naked celtic bonfires ancestors fires string banjo get better better horrified see available amazon people find guaranteed transport troubled world long want modern edge blended traditional irish style great title haunting favorite genre looking irish diddley aye ones instrumental constituting seamus seamus egans egans juniper sleeps traditional arranged egan original original works works modern artists egans original compositions thirds
502,939,B000000E8S,"`The Three Kingdoms' with John Renbourn & Stefan Grossman and `Jerry Garcia / David Grisman', released in 1990 and 1991 respectively continue a great tradition of superstar duet albums. In fact, John Renbourn may be the all time star of this genre, having done issues with Grossman, Robin Williamson, and the very notable 1960's album with Bert Jansch.Grossman is also no slouch at duets, as my first encounter with his music was on a 1960's duet album paired with Danny Kalb which specialized in acoustic blues pieces. I was so pleased at discovering this album that I made a point of attending Stefan Grossman's performance at the Bethlehem Musikfest in 1986 or 1987 in the pouring rain. As there were but three people in the audience, Mr. Grossman had us all pull our chairs up from the open air house to the covered stage where he performed for at least 40 minutes of his 50 minute set. I point this out simply to indicate that Stefan Grossman is a very nice man as well as being an exceptionally accomplished musician.As I play none of the instruments on which these four very important musicians perform and my only claim to knowing anything about their music is that I have listened to a lot of it over the years, my primary source of insight is to compare two superficially similar albums to determine why one may prefer one to the other.For starters, `The Three Kingdoms' is entirely instrumental, entirely acoustic, and almost entirely collected from compositions by the two named performers. Both Grossman and Renbourn are playing guitar on most cuts. And, almost all cuts are guitar duets with, I imagine, the composer taking the lead part on each tune.In contrast, the `Garcia / Grisman' album mixes instrumentals with several vocals from Garcia. It also mixes compositions by Garcia and Grisman with pieces by Hawkins-Darnell, Irving Berlin, Hoagy Carmichael, and `traditional'. Garcia performs on guitar while Grisman performs on mandolin. Thus, this album has a much wider range of styles and textures in the music.My very novice ear for technical skill says that the instrumental work on the two albums is very close, with a slight edge going to Grossman and Renbourn.As I have bought both and enjoy both albums, I have to believe there is very little to choose between the two unless you happen to be an avid Grateful Dead Fan or an avid Pentangle / John Renbourn fan. If you simply happen to like good guitar music, buy them both. They are certainly closer to the tastes of the general audience than similar recordings by Robin Williamson.","Folk Rock,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,British Folk,World Music,Rock,Blues,Folk",three kingdoms john renbourn stefan grossman jerry garcia david grisman released respectively continue great tradition superstar duet fact john renbourn may time star genre done issues grossman robin williamson notable bert jansch grossman also slouch duets first encounter duet paired danny kalb specialized acoustic blues pieces pleased discovering made point attending stefan grossmans performance bethlehem musikfest pouring rain three people audience mr grossman us pull chairs open air house covered stage performed least minutes minute set point simply indicate stefan grossman nice man well exceptionally accomplished musician play none instruments three three kingdoms kingdoms john john renbourn stefan grossman grossman jerry jerry garcia david david grisman released respectively continue great tradition superstar duet fact john john renbourn time star genre issues grossman robin robin williamson notable bert jansch jansch grossman slouch duets first encounter encounter duet paired danny kalb kalb specialized acoustic acoustic blues blues pieces pleased discovering point attending stefan grossmans grossmans performance musikfest pouring rain people audience mr grossman pull chairs open open air air house covered stage performed minutes minute set set point point simply indicate stefan grossman grossman nice man exceptionally accomplished musician play instruments

504,943,B000000E93,"I don't know if I would consider this Renbourn's best album (and I have  everything else he's ever produced to compare it with), but it certainly is  a very good one.  'As good a place as any to begin if you had to choose one  as a starting point.  For the unitiated: Renbourn sounds a bit like Pierre  Bensusan, though the latter performer cannot match his speed and elegance. John Renbourn composed this album as a modern version of the eight standard musical forms of midieval Britain. Consisting solely of Renbourn's guitars, accompanied by traditional percussion instruments and a flute, it  gives a completely new identity to the concept album.  Listen late at  night, with candles and red wine, and float away on &quot;The Pelican&quot;  and &quot;The Black Balloon.&quot;  A fiery dance, the  &quot;Tarboulton&quot; allows guitar and flute to show off.  A classic. The best John Renbourne by far.  I have the vinyl album, worn though it may be -- but I've since bought the CD.  If this is your first Renbourne, get the Black Balloon. Although The Hermit is a close contender, I would claim this to be Renbourne's finest album, and this from a man who has a respectable body of work behind him. This is an instrumental album displaying the virtuosity of Renbourne's guitar playing. The dazzling display of fingerwork shown on all these tracks would impress a Segovia or a Bream, with whom, to these ears at least, I would not hesitate to place him. The first three tracks are stately baroque pieces played without accompaniment. The final two tracks are composed by Renbourne and have a lovely accompaniment by a flutist and, through the use of double tracking, Renbourne on electric guitar. In case you think the use of an electric guitar clashes with the acoustic purity displayed elsewhere, the playing is so masterly that he manages to make it sound like the most natural thing on earth.The Black Balloon is a thing of beauty from the opening note to the last. For fans of the acoustic guitar, I recommend it whole-heartedly. On this collection of mostly solo instrumentals (Renbourn is occasionally joined by flute and tabors), the listener is treated to a series of folk pieces--the last three all in excess of seven minutes.The liner notes get a bit technical for this listener.  For example, of the opening track we are told: &quot;After establishing the theme in sedate quarter-notes, it launches into a fascinating set of variations in typical Elizabethan manner, moving into progressively more animated figurations in slightly altered harmony.  At the fifth variation, the theme migrates beneath lively motifs in the upper voice in eighth--and sixteenth notes, before introducing fresh but related material leading to a closing restatement of the original theme intact.&quot;  I think what that really means is that Renbourn plays some of the most amazing fingerstyle guitar you're ever likely to hear.In addition to his solo albums, Renbourn has recorded a series of duo albums with former Pentangle bandmate Bert Jansch as well as with American Stefan Grossman, all of which are worth seeking out.  If you enjoyed the folk music of Pentangle or the John Renbourn group, but are more interested in simply hearing Renbourn's unadorned guitar playing, this album is an excellent introduction.  RECOMMENDED This is a very special recording indeed - and one I first loved in the mid eighties. Standout tracks are ""The Pelican"" with inspired use of harmonics with cleverly swooping and diving melody, and the beautiful ""Black Balloon"". There is something intensely moving about this music - I always did ""fill up"" when hearing it,- something wistful and bitter sweet about it! John Renbourn is an amazing guitarist - as all who've seen him live will testify! I cannot imagine any guitarist/acoustic lover  being disappointed after buying this gem.","Folk Rock,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,British Folk,World Music,Rock,Folk",dont know would consider renbourns best everything else hes ever produced compare certainly good one good place begin choose one starting point unitiated renbourn sounds bit like pierre bensusan though latter performer cannot match speed elegance john renbourn composed modern version eight standard musical forms midieval britain consisting solely renbourns guitars accompanied traditional percussion instruments flute gives completely new identity concept listen late night candles red wine float away quot pelican quot quot black balloon quot fiery dance quot tarboulton quot allows guitar flute show classic best john renbourne far vinyl worn though may ive since bought cd first renbourne get black balloon although th dont know consider best produced compare certainly good good place begin choose starting starting point point sounds bit pierre bensusan performer match speed elegance john composed modern version standard musical musical forms forms britain solely guitars accompanied traditional percussion percussion instruments instruments flute completely new identity concept listen late late night night candles red red wine wine float away pelican quot quot black balloon quot fiery dance quot quot allows guitar flute show classic best john far vinyl worn bought cd black balloon
505,944,B000000E98,"Great picking. Great composing. Educational. WON-derful listening. If you're not into Stefan Grossman, you need to at least TRY it. I've long since lost count of how many albums Grossman has put out; almost all are out of print at this point, but, luckily, here we are with a cd version of &quot;Yazoo Basin Boogie.&quot; This was one of his early albums, ca. 1970 I think, and it was a less blatantly commercial effort than the others that surrounded it in time. In fact, it was both very close and very intimate, just Grossman and his guitar, and a whole bunch of short, beautifully chosen, and beautifully delivered country blues instrumentals. My favorite on this collection is 'Pigtown Fling,' in which Grossman sets this popular old work to a Bach-like counterpoint arrangement--which incredibly seems to do no violation to its bouncy, inebriated personality. But this is just me; any guitarist worth the name will find this set delightful on its own terms, and come to understand why Grossman is such a leader in this realm. This album by Stefan Grossman is easily one of my favorite CDs of country blues guitar. Grossman is an acknowledged master of the genre, a prolific teacher and guitar virtuoso. This CD incorporates many different blues styles ie delta blues, ragtime, alternating bass (ie Missippi John Hurt), and the guitar styles of Reverend Gary Davis, of whom Stefan was a student. Anyways, this CD basically takes all of these styles to a new level, integrating many different techniques and very difficult peices, but at the same time with excellent taste and feeling.

506,945,B000000E99,"Wonderful and intricate guitar work makes this album worth owning.  Very broad range of musical interpretation from Faro's Rag to Three Pieces by O'Carolan. I own every recording Renbourn has ever produced with his name on the main  by-line, and he's never put out an unsatisfactory work. Even then, this is  one of his best from his earlier years.  It's an all solo-instrumental set  with no vocals (though another truly exceptional guitarist, John James,  sits in on several tracks as well), featuring both originally composed  material and adapted works by O'Carolan and others.  I like this particular  album by Renbourn because his treatment of the material does not fall  victim to his one occasional weakness as a guitarist: a tendency toward  repetition.  If you listened much to NPR's program &quot;All Things  Considered&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s you will recognize one of the cuts  from this album, which was used for many years as a filler sequence on that  program. to me, john renbourn does for the british isles what john fahey did for american folk music. his solo acoustic guitar work evokes the spirit of his homeland in a uniquely beautiful way. here he draws from Elizabethan age england, 17th and 18th century ireland, on up to 1991, with self-composed pieces. the guitar work itself is jaw-dropping great, not to be missed. lastly, i would like to praise the sound achieved on this recording. no producer is named in the linear notes, but whoever got this ""sound"" is to be commended. it comes through the speakers like mr renbourn is right there in the room with you. you can feel his fingers on the strings, and here them buzz after plucked with a clarity i've seldom heard on solo guitar recordings. great, great folk music from the british isles. This is a typical John Renbourn masterpiece. He almost always comes out with excellent interpretations on his instrumental albums and this is no exception. Not so keen on his singing on some other albums and he was a bit of a grumpy sod when I saw him live, but his playing is always superlative wonderful to listen too, great music and great playing, would have preferred less singing but even that is very good This is one of the best guitar albums of all time....an absolute must. Renbourn is a real pioneer and this album is everything modern steel string guitar is about. Beautiful--masterful guitar playing--it really just doesn't get much better than this. Very soothing--great to listen to at the office.

508,947,B000000E9F,"If you like the acoustic guitar, buy this, borrow it or steal it! John Rebourn was in Pentangle, whoseBasket of Lightwas one of the most if not most the imporatant jazz folk albums of the 1960s, back when this band, Fairport Convention and Nick Drake were spilling over with imagination.His solo Lady Unicorn is a little more spare than the Pentengle album, but no less beautiful and technically accomplished. Spare does not mean minimal, and Redbourn here uses light textures and instruments like flutes and cello to make wonderfully nimble pieces of midevil sounding musicExcellent. When Renbourn put this album out around 1970, it was quite an unusual release.  He and his friend Bert Jansch were at that point heading the band Pentangle, and between their solo efforts and the band's had been exploring a synthesis of folk, blues, classical and jazz styles.  This album brought to the mix yet another element: Medieval and Renaissance music.  Renbourn's solo and small ensemble arrangements of the material are mostly gentle and respectful, yet incorporate a jazz flair that give them a truly contemporary sound.  This was really good dinner and/or 'date' music for the period: quiet and intimate, and with plenty of personality.  It's not very long, however--couldn't someone put it together with &quot;Sir John Alot...&quot; as a twofer? I have worn out several vinyl records of this album over the years since 1970. Out of all the music I have ever heard, this music seems to open up my inner being in some strange way.  I have found this music to be relaxing  and enjoyable beyond any other music I know.  For reasons unclear to me, it  seems to slip me into a state of deep contemplation and wonderful  creativity.  It allows me to find parts of myself I barely know exist.  It  has consistantly encouraged me to write, emote, and just enjoy life.  I  have never grown weary of it and am glad to see it in CD format. The  wonderful melodies and harmonies of the songs on this album seem to speak  to one another in the deepest emotional terms. Thanks John. It was love at first sound, when i heard ""The Lady and the Unicorn"" back in the mid-1970's at a friend's party. It is such a joy to find it available on cd. I am not a musician, but the quality of this recording appears quite excellent, capturing all the subtlest  intricacies, in each melody.Even though the ballads & aires are not recorded on the original instuments of the time period, John Renbourn (on guitars & sitar), Terry Cox, (hand drums & glockenspiel), Don Harper (viola), Len Nicholson (concertina), Tony Roberts & Ray Warleigh (flutes), and Dave Swarbrick (violin), recreate each work with  devotion and passion, that all that is needed is to close ones' eyes, and drift back to a misty horizon in 14th century England and Europe. Enjoy the journey with this timeless work of melodic art.  :>)rainbowolf~bridge I have liked this album from the first time I heard it at a friends house back in 1974. I played it at Easter when my family was over and a couple of my brothers recognized it. John Renbourn has a distinct sound. Another instance where I purchased the album 40-years & lead me to be become a big John Renbourn fan.Some excellent songs on it. This is a very nice cd, but I have to admit, I don't reach for it as much as &quot;Sir Johnalot&quot;. This is really a rennaisance sound, completely acoustic, and very relaxing. Renbourn is a virtuoso guitarist. Like the other reviewers here, I have loved this album since I bought a copy from a departing friend in 1974.  I'm on my third copy, and have given away two CD versions of this great music to friends.  John Renbourn  stretches the boundaries of folk with &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn,&quot;  but his treatment of all these tunes is always full of joy and respect.  That's what makes this music something that you come back to again and  again.  Buy this CD:  you won't be sorry! Originally issued in late 1970, this jewel of English folk/jazz endures the test of time beautifully. With the sparkling percussion work of Terry Cox and subtle yet superb viola playing of Don Harper to complement Renbourn's impeccable fretwork, this album still sparkles. And, with a couple of bonus tracks - (one from Renbourn's folk collective 'Pentangle') - the CD has been ""fleshed out"" from less than 34 minutes to over 42!

509,949,B000000E9S,"I have been a Bert Jansch fan for over thirty years, own just about all of  his recorded material, and count him as my single favorite performer.  This  anthology is clearly the best one available as of this writing (the other  reviewer's comments notwithstanding--some of the &quot;tape stretch&quot;  he refers to was also present on the 33 rpm issues: a lot of Jansch's early  material was recorded at home on a portable tape player, so high audio  quality can hardly be expected). If you can't admire the man's significant  creative genius from this sample of tracks, there's no hope for you--it  would be difficult to come up with the name of another acoustic guitarist  in the second half of the 20th century who produced a more original and  influential style than did Jansch. And the good news is that this sample by  no means exhausts his catalog of first-rate material. Bert Jansch in his prime handled his guitar like a flamenco-playing gypsy (complete with ear-ring) besotted with Charles Mingus, and sang like a war-pipe mourning the dead. And when he cut loose with one of the ancient murder-ballads he bloody meant it. Anyone who compares this man with Nick Drake, let alone Donovan, should have his bloody throat slashed with the sock-dirk Jansch undoubtedly kept in the leg of his jeans in case somebody touched his guitar.Along with John Fahey, Doc Watson and Sandy Bull, one of the first generation of acoustic guitar-gods. I read recently on the net that he recently received an award from the Brits ""for lifetime achievement,"" and I can imagine his response. ""High bloody time."" Very original guitar and lyrics.  Articulate and sincere.  . . . . . . . . . . . . Never heard of the guy, and it happened quite by accident with all the Led Zeppelin controversy surrounding their lifting of songs. Caught wind of Black Waterside through a side by side comparison with that of Led Zeppelin's Black Mountainside. Fell in love with the Jansch version once I heard it and decided to take a chance on the Best Of mp3 download. It's really good. Can't help wonder how many other people this guy has influenced besides Neil Young, Crosby Stills & Nash, Sandy Denny, Jimmy Page, because there are so many nuances/color and shades evident in his style/songwriting captured in so much of what we know today as classic rock from the 60's and 70's. It's like opening a time-capsule of sound, and I was less surprised to hear people like Neil Young talk so well of him once I heard all the music. Bit of a pioneer here in Jansch...you will enjoy this if you like Mitchell, CSN, CSN&Y, folk and classic acoustic folk rock. I bought this album on the basis of a review in Sterophile Magazine. Big mistake!  The acoustic guitar playing is very nice and he is obviousley a good technician with regard to his playing but unforunately, his playing is interrupted with his singing which is not in the least enjoyable. Good guitarist, poor vocals. Neil Young once said that Bert Jansch did for the acoustic guitar in the 1960s what Jimi Hendrix did for the electric guitar, and you can take that statement at face value or you can listen to ""The Best of Bert Jansch"" and decide for yourself.  Chances are you will recognize the first track, ""Blackwaterside"" as being the inspiration, so to speak, for Jimmy Page's ""Black Mountain Side"" on ""Led Zeppelin I.""  Which reminds me, that as long as we are throwing around comparisons of acoustic guitar playing to electric guitar playing when Jansch joined up with John Renbourn in the group Pentacle it was the equivalent of having Page and Jeff Beck playing with the Yardbirds at the same time.  You might also recognize ""Angi"" from an early Simon & Garfunkle album, an instrumental piece written by Davey Graham, so there are some major influences involved here even if for some reason you have not heard of Jansch until now.  Just to complete the circle, ""Blackwaterside"" is somewhat reminiscent of Graham's ""She Moved Tho' the Fair,"" so apparently Jansch be both a borrower and a lender.It will not take you long to become convinced that Jansch's stark fingerpicking is first class.  What will take longer is realizing that he is a decent songwriter as well.  There are a few traditional pieces here, starting with ""Black Water Side"" and continuing with ""Reynardine"" and ""The Gardner.""  But of the twenty-five tracks collected here on this 1990 release from Shanachie, sixteen are written by Jansch.  The best known is ""Needle of Death,"" inspired by the death of a friend on heroin, which is ironic given that it is an atypical Jansch song, where the singing and the lyrics overshadow the guitar playing.  But when Jansch included lyrics with his songs they did tend to be rather dark in nature.  Most of these songs are short, two to three minutes, in length, which explains why you end up with only 66 minutes of music with twenty-five tracks.  But that is still over an hour's worth of music that establishes Jansch as an important figure in the British folk movement.Jansch's singing seems indifferent at times, but there are a few moments where he is committed to his voice being the primary instrument, such as on ""Needle of Death"" and his cover of Ewan MacColl's ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.""  Still, it is the guitar playing, which sounds like it comes from the Renaissance one moment, as with ""Nicola"" and ""Sarabanda,"" and another you find him playing blues guitars on tracks like ""Strolling, Strolling Down the Highway"" and ""Come Back Baby.""  If you want you can just program this CD to do nothing but the instrumental tracks: 2, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22 and 24, and have a really fine album right there.  In fact, when you get to songs like ""Poisoned"" and ""Promised Land"" where there are suddenly drums and other instruments you are rather surprised and just want to get back to Jansch playing his guitar, whether he bothers to sing or not.The songs are not arranged chronologically, so you are going to have tracks from his first album, recorded on a portable tape player in the kitchen of his London flat with Jansch playing a borrowed guitar, alternating with those from the end of the 1960s when he was going for a more commercial sound using studio musicians before he returned to a sound more in lines with his earlier folk recordings.  But ""The Best of Bert Jansch"" is obligated to cover the entire spectrum of the height of his musical career.  Most of his original albums are out on CDs, sometimes in combinations (e.g., his first and third albums, ""Bert Jansch"" and ""Jack Onion""), all of which will persuade you to remember Jansch when you start ticking off the names of the greatest guitar players of your lifetime. Coming of age in the sixties with a guitar in your hand, it was impossible to ignore Bert's work. Solo, with John Renbourne, in Pentangle, or reflected in the work of early Paul Simon (covering Anji) or Jimmy Page (appropriating Black Waterside), his influence was enormous. Sparkling fingerwork, an authentic vocal sound, and brilliant, eclectic compositions make this a must-have CD for anyone who wants to know about the roots of the late 20th century popular acoustic guitar sound. If only we could get rid of those drums....without them this would be a 5 star album. I have been listening to Bert Jansch since the 60's, his Pentangle years.  Incredible skillful player who brought a clarity and precision to his work.  This is an excellent sampler of his work. Im listening to this CD as Im writing this review and Im exceedingly stunned by the raw beauty of the playing and production.Im new to this artist, but this is simply one of the best finger-style CDs I have ever  bought.bluesy/celtic/salty vocals...This is a six star! This album was originally released by Transatlantic (and distributed by Kicking Mule in the U.S.) in 1979 with the same album cover, but with only thirteen tracks--and only eight of those show up on this generous 25-track anthology of Bert Jansch's work from 1965-1971, covering such albums as It Don't Bother Me, Jack Orion (with future Pentangle co-founder John Renbourn), Nicola, Birthday Blues and Rosemary Lane.The Best of Bert Jansch includes instrumentals like &quot;Perigrinations,&quot; &quot;Alman&quot; and &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;--all clocking in at under two minutes each. Then there's the bluesy interpretaion of Davey Graham's instrumental &quot;Angie.&quot; In addition to being a gifted guitar player, his songwriting and expressive vocals on songs like &quot;It Don't Bother Me&quot; and &quot;Needle of Death&quot; make Jansch one of the most important folk artists of the 20th Century.While Jansch's albums from the past two decades have been few and  often go out of print (I would recommend 1981's Heartbreak and 1990's Ornament Tree), his early Transatlantic recordings are still readily available (many of them as two-fers).  So if this album leaves you wanting more (and it should), I would suggest Rosemary Lane, Birthday Blues and his self-titled debut.

510,950,B000000E9Y,"The Cruisin' series hired old-time DJs to recreate vintage rock-n-roll radio shows. Yes, you get commercials, local news, and other chatter between the songs - but that's what's fun about this series compared to all the other re-issues.

I highly recommend it to everyone who likes this eras music. The music is there, but you need to wade through a 'beloved' radio show to get to the tunes.  Not what was expected but overall OK. I loved the music. But it wasn't what I was looking for. Would prefer it without the commercials and jingles!! I had a cruising cassette series that I'm looking to replace with cd's I do love the Cruisin' CDs for their ability to take you back in time to the era when maybe you mingled with older teens on the bus ride to school, or you were listening to pop hits on the radio for the first time. This music is very beautiful as a nostalgia collection featuring this particular format where a DJ introduces pop hits of the year.  The commercials from back then are greatly appreciated by me, too. It is fun to hear what was popular to buy then, for teen listeners. A must have for anyone growing up in the detroit area.  great 50,s radio show with commercials. good memories The very reason that the Cruisin' series exists is to capture the famous Disc Jockeys and the music. The series was created by a distinguished air personality (Ron Jacobs, most notably from KHJ in Los Angeles). This is the way it was back in the 50s & 60s on AM Top 40 Radio. The DJs were as much of the reason to listen as were the songs, in fact, sometimes more. AM Radio was Personality Radio - it was spontaneous, fresh and fun. It wasn't until the 70s when FM Radio started to grow with the 'Underground' Rock sound and the jocks were more subdued and laid back (generally to suggest an herbal influence of sorts, but that's another story for another time). Top 40 Radio split apart some time in the latter 80s and now we have narrow-casting of musical formats with everything pre-programmed - no more DJs picking the songs or doing much that hasn't been pre-determined - it's all safe, sane, and sterile. So my advice is ""don't buy the Cruisin' series if you want just songs because these are capsules of an audio entertainment genre that is long gone, never to return"" ... Love the format where the disc jockey and his show has been recorded.  The music and commercials bring back alot of fond memories.","Teen Pop,Oldies,Special Interest,Pop,R&B,Doo Wop,Rock,Oldies & Retro",cruisin series hired old time djs recreate vintage rock n roll radio shows yes get commercials local news chatter thats whats fun series compared issues one takes right heart era get evening classic rock n roll radio awesome cd finest youth highly recommend everyone likes eras need wade beloved radio show get tunes expected overall ok loved wasnt looking would prefer without commercials jingles cruising cassette series im looking replace cds love cruisin cds ability take back time era maybe mingled older teens bus ride school listening pop hits radio first time ver series hired old old time time djs recreate vintage rock rock n roll roll radio radio shows shows commercials local local news news chatter whats fun series compared issues right right heart heart era get evening classic classic rock rock rock n roll roll radio awesome cd youth highly recommend likes eras need wade beloved radio radio show show tunes expected overall loved looking prefer commercials jingles cruising cassette series looking replace cds love cds ability take back time era maybe mingled older teens bus bus ride ride school listening pop hits radio radio first time
511,956,B000000EBT,"I enjoy Joplin's music, and Max Morath is for me the undisputed number one interpreter. Joining him is the Original Rag Quartet with splendid arrangements of several Joplin compositions. Of particular interest is 'A Real Slow Drag' from Jolin's opera Treemonisha, one of the harmonically most pleasing arrangements I have ever heard. This CD belongs in every musicologist's collection. Enjoy... I sure did, and will for a long time to come. I especially enjoyed these rendentions which include a wide array of other instrumentation rather than strictly piano like other Ragtime selections I have purchased. Max Morath has been an all-around fine representative of the old-style ragtime performer.  His interpretations of the Joplin classics are well-known and loved by many.  The discoveries here are some of the more unfamiliar composers and their rousing ragtime works.  Well worth the price! I bought this album in 1977 when it first came out.  The quality of performance is outstanding which is uncommon in the ragtime genre.  This Album gives you a great view of ragtime during the Joplin period.Two complaints about the MP3's here represented: First, Where did Joseph Lamb's Cottontail Rag go?  The original album had it and it was a remarkable and sensitive performance.Second:  The titles of the pieces are wrong from Track 16 to the end! They should be as follows:.......Should Be16. Ragtime Dance17. Alabama Jigger18. The Cascades19. Swipesy Cake Walk20. Russian Rag21. Grace and Beauty22. Polyragmic23. Carrie's Gone to Kansas CityBuy the Album but fix the Track names! The CD lacks bass.  I have the LP which I love, and it sounds very much like a real piano.  I bought the CD for portability and was disappointed by the sound quality.  The bass portion of the spectrum is greatly diminished, it doesn't sound like a real piano.  I think it was recorded from the same master that was used to cut the original LP, but that master had the RIAA bias in it that reduces bass and emphasizes treble.","Ragtime,Jazz,Pop,Classical,Traditional Jazz & Ragtime",enjoy joplins max morath undisputed number one interpreter joining original rag quartet splendid arrangements several joplin compositions particular interest real slow drag jolins opera treemonisha one harmonically pleasing arrangements ever heard cd belongs every musicologists collection enjoy sure long time come especially enjoyed rendentions include wide array instrumentation rather strictly piano like ragtime selections purchased max morath around fine representative old style ragtime performer interpretations joplin classics well known loved many discoveries unfamiliar composers rousing ragtime works well worth price bought first came quality performance outstanding uncommon ragtime genre th enjoy max max morath undisputed number number one interpreter joining original rag quartet splendid arrangements compositions interest real slow slow drag drag jolins opera treemonisha harmonically arrangements heard cd belongs musicologists collection enjoy sure long long time time come especially enjoyed include wide array instrumentation strictly piano ragtime selections purchased max max morath fine representative old old style style ragtime performer interpretations classics known loved discoveries unfamiliar composers rousing ragtime works worth price bought came quality performance outstanding uncommon ragtime genre

(On my short list, it's joined by the Louis Armstrong Hot Five and Hot Seven, Jelly Roll Morton and His Hot Peppers, and the famous Blanton-Webster Duke Ellington band of 1939-42, one or another of Milles Davis's classic groups (my pick would be the 1957=58 quintet with Coltrane, Red Garland, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones), John Coltrane's Ascension, and Sonny Rollins's Saxophone Colossus.)It records one of the most significant events in the history of jazz as well -John Hammond's inspired bringing together of black and white musicians on the same stage and in the same combos, the mixing of jazz styles from New Orleans (New Orleans Foot Warmers) through stride (James P. Johnson) up to the newer boogie woogie (Lewis, Ammons, Pete Johnson) and swing (Goodman, Basie), and the juxtaposition of jazz music, gospel singing, and blues. These two concerts, plus the famous Carnegie Hall concert of the Benny Goodman orchestra in 1937, at which several members of the Basie and Ellington band performed were instrumental in making jazz respectable and making it possible, at least in the North, for blacks and whites to perform together before whites as well as blacks in the same musical group. The Spirituals to Swing concerts, in particular, demonstrated that jazz had a history and showed the rich affinities that existed among various forms of African American music  -jazz, gospel singing, country and urban blues.Hammond was apparently instrumental in getting Charlie Christian, the first modern electric guitar player and a truly great soloist, to play with Basie's men (the Kansas City Six) at the concert. It was an inspired joining. As good as Christian sounded with Goodman, at heart he was more of a Basieite -more in tune with the more relaxed swing produced by Basie's rhythm section (Walter Page, Jo Jones) and the inspiration he gained from playing with the eloquent modernist Lester Young shows in the quality of the music he produces on his axe.These concerts apparently inspired the end of the thirties craze for boogie woogie which launched pianists Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson on a successful career performing to standing room only at the stylish Caf&eacute; Society in Greenwich Village. Nor was Hammond solely an advocate for the new in jazz. He brought back forgotten or largely ignored giants like James P. Johnson, who played his signature composition, ""Carolina Shout,"" and, in the New Orleans Footwarmers, featured the veteran Sidney Bechet in what was arguably his best combo, with trumpeter Tommy Ladnier, not only an exciting player but one of the few of his time who could stand up to Bechet's insistent tone in ensemble.The Golden Gate Quartet and the Mitchell Christian Singers introduced their plangent music (liberal use of train sounds and rhythms) to an audience until then largely or wholly unfamiliar with its power. Country blues singers Big Bill Broonzy and harmonica virtuous Sonny Terry (who doubles his mouthy harp playing with weird falsetto vocal breaks) were juxtaposed against the singing of Ida May Cox, a worthy inheritor of Bessie Smith's blues style, of Helen Humes, perhaps the perfect singer for the Basie band, and the raw edged energy of Joe Turner, just launching himself on a career that would culminate twenty years later in some of the best rhythm and blues recordings ever made.This is an album that doesn't have best cuts because all of the cuts are best. With one exception -Basie's ""Mortgage Stomp"" is really just ensemble playing; there is no stretching out. This is a superlative album, so good that its occasional lapses in sound quality are forgiven. If you don't own it, just buy it. You'll be listening to it for a long time. ~ While this 1990 2-CD release is a nice recording of an historical concert, I think most people will be more interested in the 1999 3-CD versionFrom Spirituals To Swing, which has superior sound, more music, and more comprehensive booklet inserts (unfortunately at a higher price.)","Swing Jazz,Jazz,Special Interest,Pop,Classic Big Band,Blues,Vocal Blues",spirituals swing carnegie hall concerts vanguard cds benny goodman sextet bg clari charlie christian guit lionel hampton vib fletcher henderson p arthur bernstein b nick fatool dr count basie band cb p earl warren herschel evans lester young jack washington reeds ed lewis harry edison buck clayton shad collins tpt dickie wells dan minor benny morton tbn freddie greene guit walter page b jo jones dr kansas city six b clayton tpt l young ten sx c christian elect guit f greene rhythm guit w page b j jones dr new orleans footwarmers sidney bechet sop sx tommy ladnier tpt dan minor tbn james p johnson p w page b j jones dr cd got rhythm flying home memories bg tet blues helen helen humes voc w basie p b clayton tpt l young clari w page b j jones dr mortgage stomp one oclock jump basie band blues lips basie band add hot lips page tpt rhythm man basie band good morning blues way yonder new orleans kc aint got nobody w basie p w page b j jones dr dont th spirituals swing carnegie hall hall concerts vanguard cds benny benny goodman benny goodman sextet goodman sextet bg clari charlie christian christian lionel lionel hampton hampton fletcher henderson bernstein nick nick fatool dr count count basie basie band earl earl warren herschel herschel evans young jack jack washington washington reeds ed lewis harry edison buck buck clayton shad shad collins dickie dickie wells minor benny benny morton morton freddie freddie greene walter page page jo jo jones jones dr kansas city city six young sx christian elect rhythm page new new orleans orleans footwarmers sidney bechet sop sx tommy ladnier minor james p johnson page jones dr cd got rhythm flying flying home home memories bg tet blues helen helen humes voc basie young clari page jones dr mortgage stomp oclock jump basie band blues lips band add hot hot lips hot lips page lips lips page page rhythm man basie band good blues way new new orleans orleans kc aint got basie page jones dr dont
513,958,B000000EBY,"After my first Clancy Brothers purchase... I just had to have another. They are such a refreshing quartet of energy and talent. This is my first Clancy Brothers CD and I love it.  Brings me back to my Irish roots.  Cheers... All. Not listened to the Clancy Brothers for 3 decades. A number of the tracks - particularly 'the Jolly Tinker', 'Leaving of Liverpool'and 'the Holy Ground' - took me straight back to my youth. These were songs I used to sing quietly when carrying small children and trying to get them back to sleep in the middle of the night.I will certainly be looking out for more CDs. Particular favourite tracks I will be looking for are 'Moses', 'the Rising of the Moon', and the ultimate anti-war song 'Jonny I Hardly Knew You'. I bought this album as an audio cassette titled 'Golden Hour of the Clancy Brothers with Lou Killen' in New York in the 1970's and have loved it ever since. As the tape will not last forever I have been searching for a CD version - I managed to find most of the songs but not 'the Mermaid' which is one of my favourites - and now I've found the whole lot under a different name! I think this is possibly their best album. I can't recommend it too highly. My grandfather had an eight track of the Clancy Brothers performing a live concert.  It made this hillbilly wish he was Irish.  I have to say that the studio recordings on Greatest Hits loose a lot of the ebergy from that eight track. great cd all my faves are on here that i remember listening to as a kid, its a must have! Loved them way back when and now they are just as much fun to listen to. Will probably look for some others. This is one of my favorite Irish ballad CDs.The tunes are well chosen for sadness, Patriot Game to the funny Old Maid In The Garrett.There is humor and rebellion and history here, all to be enjoyed by the Irish where ever they maybe,and as my father used to say, those that wish they were Irish. The group was very popular in the 1970s and 1980s. They here sing 24 traditional Irish songs, recorded in 1973. They harmonise beautifully, with a fine background of banjo and guitar. All cheerful songs. For fans of Irish pub music, this is one of the best. For me, very pleasant memories of their songs that I enjoyed 40 years ago. Without Tommy Makem, Clancy Brothers' albums lose a bit of their Irishness, both in vocals and in playing, but it is definitely not a fatal blow. Lou Killen is a skilled singer and musician, and this 1973 double-LP has much that is worthily done. In fact, it would be my recommendation as an introduction to the Clancys for anyone who might find their bitter anti--Brit renditions, or mournful (and bitter as well) anti-World War I songs a bit much. This collection strikes a nice balance...the humorous songs are not as silly as some the Brothers have recorded, and the serious tunes are not as grim as others in their repertoire available on other CD's. For the beginner in Clancy lore, this should hook 'em. I've been a fan since 1962 or so. The ones I like best on this disc include &quot;Gallant Forty-twa&quot;; &quot;Whistling Gypsy&quot;; &quot;Roddy McCaulay&quot;; &quot;Irish Rover;&quot; &quot;Old Woman From Wexford&quot; and &quot;Holy Ground.&quot; For the price, I don't think there is a better or larger collection available. (Just as an aside, I want to thank the original Kingston Trio for putting out several of these songs on their albums between 1958 and 1962. They led me to not only the Clancy Brothers, but to Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Cisco Houston as well...and probably others, and those artists led me to investigate their own inspirations, role models and favorite writers. Such is the connective power of good music.)","Europe,Irish Folk,Ireland,British Isles,British & Celtic Folk,Pop,Traditional Folk,Britain,World Music,Folk",first clancy brothers purchase another refreshing quartet energy talent first clancy brothers cd love brings back irish roots cheers listened clancy brothers decades number particularly jolly tinker leaving liverpooland holy ground took straight back youth used sing quietly carrying small children trying get back sleep middle night certainly looking cds particular favourite looking moses rising moon ultimate anti war jonny hardly knew bought audio cassette titled golden hour clancy brothers lou killen new york loved ever since tape last forever searching cd version managed find mermaid one clancy clancy brothers brothers purchase refreshing quartet energy talent clancy clancy brothers brothers cd love brings brings back irish roots cheers listened clancy clancy brothers brothers decades number particularly jolly tinker leaving holy holy ground ground straight youth used sing quietly carrying children trying get back sleep middle night certainly looking cds favourite looking moses rising moon ultimate anti anti war war jonny hardly knew bought audio audio cassette cassette titled golden golden hour hour clancy clancy brothers brothers killen new new york york loved ever since tape forever searching cd version managed find mermaid
514,962,B000000ECD,"This item has a really fun cover so that you can't miss it if you run across it somewhere.Not to be confused with the recent company doing retrospectives of many artists, including Pete Seeger, under the same title ""Essential Pete Seeger.""This volume seems to be the complete concert that some tracks for the recent ""Essential"" were selected from, including Wimoweh. While this concert does feature some hits that Seeger himself had with the Weavers like Wimoweh aka Mbube aka The Lion Sleeps Tonight, its not intended as a hits collection but is true to Seeger's preference for showcasing other people's songs: songs by his friend and old band mate Woody Guthrie, African American folk songs, mountain songs, world songs.It is Essential Seeger in that it gives a faithful idea of what Seeger's like in concert: its just him and his banjo, which he plays beautifully; and the folk tradition of getting the audience to laugh and sing along. Sounds like an entertaining night was had by all.Should you get it? Depends on what you're after. Don't expect Weavers studio recordings. Some of Pete Seeger's edgier songs I had never heard of before with a couple of exceptions.  Interesting mix but not my favorite. This is a fine introduction to the work of Pete Seeger. In order to understand the Folk Movement, you need to own this one and &quot;We Shall Overcome.&quot; The Essential Pete SeegerThe music here presents Pete in his early years. Most of the songs are recorded live & unlike his later concerts he does not prompt the audience to sing along.The BIG problem that I had with this recording was that it was NOT REMASTERED WELL, the volume is up to 12db low. I needed to re-record the entire CD, pumping up the volume individually on each track (excluding the clapping...) so that the songs played at a reasonable volume. but there are more satisfying CD's still available, although you may have to hunt for them. I saw Pete live three times in the '60's, and his ""We Shall Overcome: The Complete 1963 Carnegie Hall Concert"" on the Columbia label captures Seeger at the height of his popularity and relevance. For excellent early Pete, find a copy of ""Songs of Protest"" by The Almanac Singers. You get almost all the songs they ever recorded in 1940-41, and although Seeger shares the studio with Woody Guthrie, Lee Hays and others, and is likely the youngest member, he ""essentially"" is the leader already. For late Seeger, I like ""Pete"" a 1996 release on Living Music Records. For live Seeger that's just as good as the Vanguard pressing of ""Essential"" being discussed here, try ""Pete Seeger Live at Newport"" issued by Vanguard in 1993, but featuring Folk Festival appearances from '63-'65 in Rhode Island. On the album we are reviewing, there are six or seven songs I've never cared for, six or seven I have adored, and six or seven that are good enough. That's about par for the course for a Seeger concert. His personality was always winning, his generosity included bringing nearly unknown performers to share his stage. I saw him introduce Bernice Reagon, who later went on to found the  group ""Sweet Honey in the Rock"" and Rev. Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick, who made a couple of fine cameos on ""Sesame Street"" and a Scottish traditional singer named Shamus something. Pete's not a perfect person, and his politics have stayed left while mine gravitated to the center, but my gosh, for more than 50 years he went out on stage and gave the paying folks a great evening. He is the last survivor of the left-wing New York protest singing folk preservationists and revivalists who influenced Dylan, Baez, Kingston Trio members, Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs, Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins and so many others. Everyone who likes this sort of music needs at least one Seeger CD on the shelf.

517,966,B000000EDM,"Not to sound grand (...), but I rather enjoyed this compilation, bringing to life such music from our American past century.  It's nice to have the variety available at ones finger tips all in on CD set.  A great jumping off point to delve deeper into Ragtime.  As a performing artist, I use this CD in my period work for inspiration on creative pieces that reflect the spirit of early America.  Though, if you happen to be a Canadian music fan from British Columbia, you might want to try the Canadian brass ensemble instead. I just bought this set of 2 cd's, and I have become really fond of it. CD1 presents a good selection of different pianists playing very different styles and thus showing that ragtime is not all the same. CD2 contains some really catching arrangements for small ensembles, most of them contemporary. Among the selected rags are classics as well as very seldom heard tunes, and a 20 pages booklet contains (very) short but informative notes on the compositions and the artists. If you are building your own ragtime collection, you will need this set for it's own value as well as a guideline to the different artists. I agree with everything said in the other favorable reviews, including the observation that if you are already into ragtime, you may already have a number of these cuts on other CDs.  I do.  However, I wouldn't trade this collection for anything.  One, at least in my case, there's not much duplication (virtually none on the second disc, which includes performances by a number of good groups I had never heard of).  Two, this album has a bonus: really good liner notes, with something interesting on every rag composer and every performer or performing group. This was for a gift, because it is already one of our favorites -- great in the car or to help get your housework done faster!Sue and Dick Schwartz I have a rather extensive ragtime collection including such artists as Max Morath, Bill Bolcom, Guido Nielsen, Eubie Blake and Virginia Eskin, to name a few.  ""A Century of Ragtime"" enjoys a favored place in my ragtime library for its diversity of artists, both on the piano and the ensembles, and in the selection of compositions included.  The inclusion of several lesser know pieces adds to enjoyment of the package.  I highly recommend this collection for anyone just getting started in collecting ragtime music, as well as for any collector who simply wants to have a lot of fun listening to really good music played by really good artists. The band selections are very well executed; they are eclipsed by the piano performances.  The piece dedicated to Roberto Clemente is reason enough to buy the album.

518,973,B000000EF4,"This is a replacement for a vinyl record I had before our home burned down in Feb 2012. I also had the songbook. Joan's early music was using her higher voice but such clarity. Also, I love her use of the old songs, folk songs, historical songs. I am grateful that this is still available as a CD even if the songbook is not available. Thank you Amazon. This is a great collection of Joan Baez's amazing work over the first ten years of her recording career.  It is not what one could rightfully call her greatest hits, for she was not an artist who released many singles or who got an awful lot of exposure on AM radio during the 1960s and early 1970s. Instead, she was mainly played on hip FM stations, and of course, was played incessantly by folkies in their record players, so that her music wafted through the dormitories and off the college campuses of the time. So, although there are a few songs included here like ""love Is Just A Four Letter Word"" that were on the charts, most of them are known better as songs from albums one listened to again and again.Thus, we have songs like ""Ghetto"",  ""There But For Fortune"", and Dylan's ""With God On Our Side"", all beautifully done and wonderful to listen to, but certainly not songs that ever had much time on the popular airwaves of the times. So too with songs like ""Sweet Sir Galahad"", a song written by Joan describing her sister Mimi finally beginning to recover from the loss of her husband Richard Farina in a tragic motorcycle accident, or ""No Expectations"", a wonderful folksy interpretation of the Mick Jagger-Keith Richards song. There are a number of traditional songs here like ""Farewell Angelina"", ""John Riley"", and ""Mary Hamilton"". And as an added benefit, there are a number of other Bob Dylan songs, such as ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"", ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"", and ""You Ain't Going Nowhere"". All in all, this is a great collection and a fair representation of the veritable mountain of recording work Joan accomplished in the first ten years of her career. This one is a ""must buy"" for people intoxicated by Joan Baez's gorgeous voice:  the perfect vibrato, the stunning range, the sweet notes and the soulful notes.  What's wonderful about this particular album is that it contains songs that even die-hard fans may not have already, yet none of them are fillers.Joan's version of Hard-Rains-A-Gonna-Fall brings out the power and the beauty of the lyrics in a way that even Bob Dylan must have cheered at.  ""Mary Hamilton"" is an understated ballad, sung in the sweetest, highest voice that gets more powerful with every listen.  Don't be scared off by the un-Joan-like ""Ghetto"" as the opening number of this album.  It's just a little introduction.  Soon, you'll be swept away into greater magnificence like ""Sweet Sir Gallahad"" which is almost tearful in its romance.  And of course, ""With God on our Side"" is one of the great anti-war ballads.  It goes on and on ... but not for long enough!  Pacifists will be laughing and cheering by midway through the song.In some ways, this is a subtle folk album, aside from her powerful singing voice, which lends something elaborate to even the simplest songs.  But it's subtle in the sense that it doesn't have a whole lot of ""oh, yeah, I remember that one"" songs on it.  Yet it is a MUST for fans.  You do not want to be a Joan Baez fan without songs like ""John Riley"", which will tear out your heart in the hands of her exquisite rendition. For some reason or another Joan has taken flak for either her voice or music genre.  I guess some still have a problem with her 60's politics that she seems to have abandon a long time ago.  I don't.  She's a great artist and singer.  The best son on the album?  Love Is Just A Four Letter Word. What I have always love about Joan Baez is her exquisite and crystal clear voice. She is a dream to listen to and her songs fit her vocal range just perfect. This album is excellent all the way through and the songs included on the CD is the best of her repertoire from 1960 to 1970, which is why the album is called THE FIRST TEN YEARS. All of the songs on this collection are great but there are six tracks that are truly wonderful and is why I bought this album aside from the fact that she has a beautiful voice. The songs that I love from this great recording are &quot;Ghetto&quot;, &quot;If I Were A Carpenter&quot;, &quot;If I Knew&quot;, &quot;No Expectations&quot; (which is a cover of the Stones original and she sounds far better than Mick on this one.) &quot;Sweet Sir Galahad&quot; and &quot;Love Is Just A Four-Letter Word&quot;. They are all excellent and as I said before perfect for her glorious soprano voice. This is a great album to have and enjoy for many years to come and if you're a Joan Baez fan than this one is a must for your collection. GREAT and EXHILIRATING. I first got this CD from the library I had never heard Joan Baez before and I wanted to try her music out. I ended up liking the CD so much that I bought it. Joan Baez has a beautiful voice and although she does not write many of her own songs she does a great job of interpreting others.Here are some of the highlights of the CD:Love is Just a Four Letter Word: An excellent song which suprisingly Bob Dylan never recorded. Although the lyrics are not fully formed that type of poetry fits well with the song about the falseness of love.There but for Fortune: Joan Baez really captures the melancholy mood of the song. She sings it with lots of passion.John Riley: Joan Baez does a great job of interpreting English Ballads.Don't think Twice It's Allright: Although I prefer Bob Dylan's version of the song Joan Baez sings the song plainly and honestly.Sweet Sir Galahad: A sweet, pretty, yet sad song which shows that Joan Baez is a talented poet as well as singer.With God on Our Side: This song is supposed to be the one that inspired Joan to become a protest singer. The lyrics are so powerful that Joan Baez's voice is not the main centerpiece.Farewell Angelina: An amusing somewhat surreal waltz written by Dylan shortly before his rock period. After listening to this CD, I now have to buy more! I missed listening to Joan Baez the last few years. She is the quintessential folk singer .... her music is as relevant now as it was in the 60s. We wanted our 12 year old granddaughter to hear some of the great music that came out of a time, the '60 and 70's. So, we chose Baez to do the trick for us. It worked Who the hell is this nitwit (born in '63) to declare who from the 60's had talent.  Joan Baez was and is an incredible talent. For me a satisfying album. I enjoy Joan's work from her earlier years rather than the over-arranged albums that were to come. Her voice still has some of the purity that later gave way to a rather nasal quality. Joan Baez was the first folksinger to make a dent in my previous classical focus. Just about every song she sang sounded the same.  Same rhythm, same slightly mournful tone.  She's good but very limited. A great voice, her interpretations of traditional and of Dylan's songs are truly amazing. I love Joan Baez and hear her words resonate in my heart.  I visit a coffee shop and once a month a lady plays who reminds me of Joan Baez. The Cd is what I expected, it is a replacement for a worn out vinyl album. The first CD shipped was defective, it had started to delaminate, and many tracks wouldn't play. Amazon promptly replaced it with a good copy I used to have this album years ago as a vinyl which I played over and over again. Now that I no longer have a record player, I was delighted to find the same album in digital form. It's still a favorite! The cd was good, but Joan Baez does better music than this cd shows.  But all in all, still a good cd. The CD does not cover all the songs of the original double album.  How could Joan (or the editors) drop Silver Dagger? Two of my favorite songs are on this CD,  ""There But For Fortune"" and ""With God on Our Side"".  The price of the CD is worth those songs alone as far as I'm concerned!  Recommended!Email  Boland7214@aol.co Clear recording. Good collections of songs.  Great rendition of the 60's brings back an era and memories  an agreeable way to reminesce Even with one click set to OFF, I inadvertently purchased this album with a stray punch of a stylus on the Fire HD 7. Apparently there is no easy way to cancel a digital music purchase. I abhor the soulessness, the sharp tone and warble of this album's recording on MP3 format on my sound system. I wonder if the tone of the CD of this album would be as nerve racking to listen to? This is why I prefer to buy music from a box store after I audition it there. Some music gets remastered so poorly that the warmth and depth of the original music is lost. Having been around when Joan Baez was very popular, I was glad to find there was a CD comprising many of her better works.  She was one of my favorite singers (among many) of that time period.  It's thus amazing to hear her voice in as good a quality as my memory of her.  While it's reminiscent to enjoy the music from that time period, it's also simply great to hear such a wonderful voice.  Much American music these days is not so gentle and pleasant to the ears.  (which has caused me to seek music from other parts of the world to find talent like this) This item gets five stars... just as sure as spring follows winter. The task is to explain why. I have read and appreciated the other reviews (and learned a lot!) so I will try a less factual approach. If you are new to Joan Baez and/or want to know where to start, this CD is IT.I had the vinyl version of this album a hundred years ago and somehow lost track of it as is the case with many by-gone valuables. So with vague fondness, I went looking for a CD containing a song called ""Sweet Sir Gallahad"" because I remembered how it captivated me.I put the CD on... and it was as though I'd always had it, had never gone a week without listening and knowing every word. Have you gotten reacquainted with a dear friend and noticed the value of your friendship melts years and miles away in an instant? Have you ever met a new friend and known instinctively that person would always be a dear friend? Look forward to savoring this CD as one of those dear friends.Maybe you've picked up that Joan Baez has a hauntingly beautiful voice. It's true. The POWER and PURITY with which she delivers the stories on this CD are deliciously intoxicating. She could be singing Mary had a little lamb and it would be wonderful, but Joan Baez does not sing anything but deeply moving ballads...They are ""meaty:"" they kind of stick with you. And they grow on you. And after a while you just know they aren't going away anytime soon... so they are yours.This is the greatness of Joan Baez. You think that listening to this rich, beautiful voice - music on its own - is the gift... and when the CD is over, the next day comes and goes, you realize that not only is the song stuck in your head, but all the richness that Joan Baez put into the song is stuck there too. Most of these songs are timeless, as if they had written themselves... so many are stories collected from here and there and cherished because they have strong messages, passionate plots. Joan Baez found the stories that became her songs. She found them, she loved them, she sang them, she shared them, gave them to us - and now they are ours.This could be the reason there are so many high ratings... One does't take lightly the value of pricelss gifts and we diehard fans think this CD qualifies.Bottom Line: (knowing what I know) I would buy this CD if it cost twice as much and came in a paper bag... and now you know what I know... so go ahead and pay whatever it costs... and you may find it a bargain. Joan Baez `s clarity and sincerity simply radiate on this compilation.  She has a fine voice, singing in the upper ranges with little tremolo; the effect is art rather than artifice. This CD displays her understated yet  powerful voice in just over 70 minutes of peace and protest. (By the way, I  hear from someone who's met her that she's very nice.)Some of the finest  songs here are those written by Bob Dylan, ""You Ain't Goin' Nowhere"" is  revealed as a sexy love song (even with all that stuff about ""Genghis  Khan""). &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's Alright"" is probably the best song on  the CD, she captures the complex emotions with wonderfully expressive  singing and guitar--it's the best version I've ever heard. She also does a  compelling version of ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall""; she illuminates Dylan's  lengthy standard, and it sounds fresh and immediate.The first song,  ""Ghetto,"" is unfortunately also the worst.  The singing is fine, but the  bass line sounds right out of (the worst of) an Elvis show.  It also sounds  dated lyrically, as Ms. Baez sings about rising to the revolution, and in  ""building a new Jerusalem there will be no more ghetto at all.""  Oh well,  it's an honest reflection of the decade's optimism and promise.""If I  were a Carpenter"" sounds less sexist when sung by a woman, and its  treatment here is soft and loving. The country guitar work on  ""Love is  Just a Four-Letter"" word is not to my tastes, but again, her voice rises  above this.  ""If I Knew"" is a more up-tempo work, with excellent  accompaniment (I wish the players on each track were listed), and a  satisfying bridge. She also does a nice, slightly country, version of the  Stones' ""No Expectations.""Joan Baez also plays guitar beautifully, in  the same effective yet unembellished style of her singing: ""There but For  Fortune"" and ""John Riley"" are fine examples.  She seemingly transcends time  on traditional folk songs like ""Mary Hamilton"" (there's a nice little lilt  to her voice here), and live recordings of ""Geordie,"" and the  flamenco-tinged ""Te Ador.""  The singing is angelic.  Her own ""Sweet Sir  Galahad"" and Dylan's ""Farewell Angelina"" are also beautiful examples of her  work.  There are so many excellent songs to enjoy!Simple, beautiful, and  thought-provoking, Joan Baez's `first decade' CD is a welcome look back at  one of our national treasures. Yes, very pleased with this CD - I have several of hers.Joan is a fav. of mine,Thank you,Marcia Even now, after Joan's boxed set and all the subsequent compilations, this still remains her strongest &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection.  Every one of these songs is an absolute Baez classic.  Album cuts across the  first decade of Joan's career (hence the title), showcasing traditional  ballads (&quot;Silver Dagger&quot;, &quot;John Riley&quot;), protest  material (&quot;There But for Fortune&quot;, &quot;With God on Our  Side&quot;), singer/songwriter (&quot;Sweet Sir Galahad&quot;), and country  (&quot;Let the Circle be Unbroken&quot;), as well as Joan's experimental  attempts at spoken poetry (Blake's &quot;London&quot;) and symphonic  orchestration (&quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;).  Absolutely essential. This first ten year compilation showcases Joan Baez's early works, where her voice was the song.  The innocence and purity of her early folk recordings are a major mark in time for this marvelous singer.  &quot;Love Is Just A Four Letter Word&quot;, &quot;John Riley&quot; and the classic &quot;If I Were A Carpenter&quot; are memories made in and for heaven.  Some of the other songs are a surprise as you sit back and suddenly 'remember' this one or that.  This is a milestone recording This compilation covers the ten years that Joan spent recording for Vanguard. She had some success after she left, but the Vanguard recordings remain the most important of her career.She occasionally wrote her own songs (represented here by Sweet Sir Galahad) but mostly she recorded the songs of others. Her biggest influence was Bob Dylan, who wrote six of the songs here. Apparently, Bob never recorded Love is just a four letter word, but it is a lovely song. I first heard With God on our side by Manfred Mann, a sixties group who also recorded several Bob Dylan songs. Many people have recorded Don't think twice it's all right, including Johnny Cash - another singer who has made several raids on the Bob Dylan songbook. You ain't going nowhere, Farewell Angelina and A hard rain's gonna fall are his other songs here.Other covers by Joan here include There but for fortune (Phil Ochs), No expectations (Rolling stones), Turquoise (Donovan) and the often covered If I were a carpenter. There are also some traditional folk songs - Mary Hamilton, Geordie and Te ador - so old that their writers are unknown.Joan recorded so many great songs that eighteen tracks cannot possibly include everything worth having, but this is a good sampling of Joan's music. If you only want one of Joan's albums, this is a good one to choose. If you want just one CD that gives you an overview of Joan Baez's career and contains her greatest hits, well...you won't find one.  Her career has been too long and varied for that.  She was at Woodstock and at Live Aid.  She covered traditional English and Spanish folk songs, protest and mainstream pop.Joan's is the finest female voice of the 60's folk revival and protest movement -- pure and melodious and true.  This particular CD has too much Dylan for my taste (although, contrary to Amazon's editorial, Gates of Eden is not on this album).  Good at the time, these now sound very dated.  But that is an accurate reflection of the period.  We tend to forget now that a great many fans admired Dylan's songwriting but wished he would leave it to the sweet-voiced Joan to sing them.My personal favorites are the traditional English songs Mary Hamilton, Geordie and John Riley.  She sings them exquisitely.  If you share that taste, you must get this CD.Given that this album has a wide variety of music and the resale value seems quite high, this is a prime candidate for ripping and burning the tracks you like and selling it on, especially as the insert notes are minimal and not worth keeping.As a child of the 60s, the album of hers that I remember best and which now seems most representative is her eponymous 'Joan Baez'.  Start either with that album or with this one. A wide ranging and thoroughly satisfying compliation of Baez' early work, including definitive interpretations of Farewell Angelina (one of Dylan's hidden masterpieces), Love is Just a Four Letter Word (another Dylan gem), and There But for Fortune, and so so much more.  Of all the great female folk singers, Joan Baez has the purest voice, and while her career may have been somewhat limited by the fact that she did not write her own songs, she is a superb interpreter of a range of material, from Dylan to old English folk songs. I doubt if anyone is going to not buy this because of the packaging, but it's worth noting anyway.  There are no liner notes whatsoever.  Also, no recording dates.  Very cheaply produced and not remastered, though the sound is good.69 minutes I had the original album and was dissapointed by the omission of Will the Circle Be Unbroken.  This song, which can be found on David's Album has a great group of background singers to give power to it.  Also lackng was  Green Green Grass of Home.  It does start off nicely with Ghetto. Also  Dylan's With God On Our Side which to this date I feel is the only version  that I like. This is my favorite Joan Baez Album. I still have the original cassette. I believe some of the best songs were left off the cd. Silver Dagger for one,Will The Circle Be Unbroken for another.Carry It On is amazing and Green Green Grass Of Home is the best I've heard  since Tom Jones.Wonder why these were left off? I have not found them on any other cd.Too bad. 'The bailiff's wife and the provost's wife cried out, alack and alas for thee' when they hear of Mary Hamilton's fate.This is one of my all time favorite Joan Baez recordings!  Having been a child born during the sixties, I grew up singing Baez's ""The Streets of Laredo"", Simon and Garfunkel's ""Feelin' Groovy"", Pete Seeger's ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone"", and other folk songs in music class at school.  I love the ballads she picks out and I love the sound of her voice regardless of what her critics say.  Six of the songs on this are Dylan tunes.  Some of my favorites are ""Sweet Sir Galahad"", ""ghetto"" (a song written by Memphians), ""There But For Fortune"", ""Don't Think Twice, it's all right"", ""John Riley"", and ""Mary Hamilton"". It's too bad that &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; was the popular AM radio song we judged her on. It was an ok song but did nothing to steer me into hearing more of her music. Which was my great loss. I  rediscovered her after reading her autobiography. I hadn't realized how  interesting she was. After reading her book I went and bought this CD and  another greatest hits of her more recent work. &quot;Ghetto&quot; is dated  but represents the period it came from accurately. &quot;If I Were A  Carpenter&quot; is a beautiful blue collar love song: simple and sincere.  &quot;Love Is Just A Four-Letter Word&quot; is too twangy for me. I pass it  over when I play the CD. &quot;There But For Fortune&quot; is one of the  true gems of this collection, and a nice introduction to Phil Ochs (her  rendition stimulated an interest in my searching for other music by Ochs).  &quot;John Riley&quot; is typical folk &quot;wall flower&quot; music. I'm  not interested in these type of stories. &quot;You Ain't Goin'  Nowhere&quot; isn't really a good song but an enjoyable song to listen to.  &quot;Mary Hamilton&quot; another indistinguishable folk &quot;wall  flower&quot; song. It would be a great campfire song, however. &quot;Manha  De Carnaval&quot; is another gem. A melodious trip that shows Baez's voice  in a different light. &quot;If I Knew&quot; is a great performance with a  poignant message. Tells us what is really strong and appealing about a man  who is more sensitive. &quot;With God On Our Side&quot; is one of my two  favorites on this CD. A political, relevant message that makes one think. I  can play it ten times and not become tired of listening to its message. The  absolute best version of it. Dylan has never done this one justice.  &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's All Right&quot; another Dylan classic and  well done by Baez. &quot;Geordie&quot; another folk &quot;wall flower&quot;  piece. &quot;Te Ador&quot; a melodic treat. &quot;No Expectations&quot; is  no melodic treat. &quot;Sweet Sir Galahad&quot; yuk! Sappy!  &quot;Turquoise&quot; nicely done. &quot;Farewell Angelina&quot; another  folksy song but this one is really good. &quot;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna  Fall&quot; the best version of the most poetic song written under the  umbella of rock n' roll. Dylan is the great American poet of the twentieth  century, even better than Ginsberg. This song and especially this version  is an anthem to all that was worth anything in the 60's and 70's. The  imagery and undercurrents of this song are biblical and much more. This is  Baez, Dylan and our generation at its best! What's up with the guy that says he bought this as a replacement for his well worn vinyl and it served the purpose? Did he actually listen all those years while the records were spinning? This cd reissue lacks 5 of the songs that were on the original LP that I actually HAVE listened to since 1970. The missing songs are: Green, Green Grass Of Home, Carry It On, Will The Circle Be Unbroken, London/Old Welsh Song and Silver Dagger! Since the reissue clocks in at around 70 minutes Vanguard could have at least given us Silver Dagger and London/Old Welsh Song and still put it all on one cd. If you are looking for a vinyl replacement this is not it. You will sorely miss the absent tracks. I am giving it only 3 stars because the title does not represent the contents. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars. If you like music from the sixties and early seventies then you like Joan Baez. She has her own style and her music has some great lyrics. Makes you think. Joan Baez is one of the most accomplished interpretive folk singer from the 60's.Still going strong after 35 years; her First ten years were definitely her best.All the essential songs from Baez's early years are included in this album. It is an excellent overview of her best recordings and her best songs. For any casual fan (like me), this album would probably be all what you will ever need; however if you are a novice in Joan Baez's Music, This album would be your best choice and excellent introduction to her music and songs.

521,1016,B000000ENY,"This is a great Cd, This type of music I can play over and over, and never get tired of it.  We listen to it in the office and it makes the day go by so quickly. It helps us look forward to the real life outside the corpoate  walls.  This music has brought  a group of people together with a common  interet in remembering and enjoying the words and thoughts in each  song..... Each one of us have had our favorite song, but now their all our  favorite.  Give your self a fresh look at real life, placed into songs and  go get this CD.  See you at the Galaxy in September! I love the bands music and this CD is no exception. I am so glad I was able to find and purchase these CD's. My grandaughter is also enjoying it with me. I love everything this band Venice does.  They are fun, talented and the songs stick with you all day long!!  Great 4 part harmonies!! They should be so famous- go see them live.  They rock! The group Venice makes music like a nice painting. Like colors the musical moods can change subtly and elegant and the interaction between the voices and the instruments is great.  David Crosby is a big fan of these guys and you should listen why he holds this opinion. I hope they will make a new album soon ! It's hard to believe a band this good exists. I have pretty much searched the planet for the type of music these guys make and with the exception of finding some recordings I didn't have of CSN, The Eagles, Poco, etc. I  couldn't find anything new until I saw these guys at The Sweetwater  nightclub in Mill Valley, Ca. They knocked my socks off. Get this CD. You  won't be sorry. I was fortunate enough to live in L.A. and see Venice perform live several times.  Since moving back to Kansas City, I was unable to find any releases available from Venice.  I was thrilled to find this album! Listening to it  took me back to those amazing live shows. The songs are memorable, the  harmonies beautiful, the song writing amazing. I can't say enough good  things about this band or this cd.J. Baker-Kansas City This CD is a great representation of the band's talents, and they are even better live!  Combining all the best of the Eagles, Beach Boys and Jackson Browne - this band should be around for a long time to come. After hearing  the songs just one time, they get stuck in your head and you can't wait to  hear them again.  &quot;Bad Timing Song&quot; and &quot;Starting Here  Again&quot; are 2 of my favorites.  I've heard that their next album will  rock even more than this one does - can't wait! Introduced to these artists at a Lowen &amp; Navarro concert, I was pleasantly surprised to hear such well-performed and conceived vocal harmonies.  If you enjoy multi-part vocals by such artists as  Restless  Heart, The Little River Band, The Eagles, or Lowen &amp; Navarro  themselves, you will like this group's work on this album and their most  recent, &quot;Spin Art.&quot; I had never heard of this group before I bought this CD. I bought it only because of the reviews I read. I love it. My wife loves it and she rarely makes comments about the music I buy.Great songs,beautiful harmony,I`ve listened to it every day for two weeks and I still want to hear it again. Highly recommended. Venice is the best at Harmony, I just loved there first two cd's so far we'll have two see about the next one now, A friend of mine just told me about them now I just love there music so far tell the next review When I heared the Lennon boys for the first time on Dutch Television  (2-meter Sessie) I was astonished that in this modern time 4 people can  make such timeless music. After this broadcast I bought the CD immediately.  I play this CD a lot in my car and at home. Even my youngest son (6 year)  says about &quot;running home&quot; - &quot;this is my song&quot;. I hope  that Venice will give a concert in Holland again (they only did so once,  but at that time I had never heared of them). I'm looking forward for their  new CD. The only reason that I do not give this CD five stars is because I am very particular about what I give a &quot;perfect&quot; rating to.  If there was a four and 1/2, I would give it.The harmonies are to die for.....the Eagles with soulful lyrics.  I have had this CD for two days and have played &quot;Never Coming Back&quot; and &quot;Running Home&quot; a dozen times apiece.  They are spectacular songs that are in a league of their own.It's funny how the more I listen to this thing (listening to it now), the more I enjoy it.  I guess that's true for many of the great CDs.I like it, in a strange way, the way I like Jeff Buckley &quot;Grace&quot;, Wilco &quot;Summerteeth&quot;, and Beck &quot;Odelay&quot;...I discover something new to enjoy at each replay.This is one of those bands that I get very selfish about.  I wish for their sakes that they achieve great success, but I like that I am one of the few that knows their talent and can keep them to myself.  that's how I felt about John Hiatt ten years ago.Despite this, buy this CD.  Play &quot;Never Coming Back&quot; about 20 times, then try to tell me something better that has been produced int he last five years (Beck doesn't count). Much fuss is made about Wilco and Ben Folds Five for suggesting the mid-70's sound in their music. Venice not only suggests this moment in time, when lyrics were sweeter and melodies gorgeous, but they outright  steal it back in a way that eludes the likes of James Taylor and Elton John  nowadays.

522,1018,B000000EQ6,"If your into SBC or any other Boston late '90's you'll enjoy this earlier Boston offering. Music needs to be paid attention to as anyone reading this will know. Keep in touch, Kord. Love this album, but Fire Records REALLY CHEAPED OUT ON THE ARTWORK/PACKAGING. The first 4 Lemonheads LP's are far too underrated (even in the alt. underground.) These recording (the 1st 3 LP's and the OOP &#34;Lovey&#34; LP) deserve the recognition. Kinda heavy on the H&uuml;sker D&uuml; and Replacements influence, but their own sound shines through to make a great mixture. Fire Records needs to stop chin sing out and making BLACK & WHITE packaging to save a few cents. It would also be great if they did a domestic release on these, but I' happy they at least got this. I've read that Evan and Ben Deily (original co-founder and singer of the band) have reunited with Juliana Hatfield (on bass) and RYAN ADAMS on drums and producing a new album. I really hope they tour. It would be amazing. SUPPORT THIS BAND! First of all this is not your typical Lemonheads album.  It is nothing but pure Punk Rock as opposed to their later music.  This is by far my favorite Lemonheads album and falls in my top 10 of all time great Punk albums.If you are the kind of person who is afraid of anything that strays far away from the commercialized crap that you can hear on your local ""alternative"" station and think that anybody who likes some good old fashioned Punk rock is immature and has bad taste in music, you best go pick up one of Evan Dando's (I can't bear to associate the band's later music as the same band who created this masterpiece) later albums. If, on the other hand, you don't mind getting a little adrenaline going with one of the best Punk records of all time, by all means pick this bad boy up. Without this gem, Greenday would have never made it big time.  This unfortuntly was as good as it got for the Boston band; it would be after this album that they ventured into wussy acoustic ballads and long haired hippydom. One of the guys disappeared and the other directs videos, maybe that's why they weren't the same afterward. If your only knowledge of the Lemonheads is ""Mrs. Robinson"" or ""It's a Shame about Ray"", this may not be for you. In my opinion, onbe of the best bands of the 80's was Husker Du, and no one had the same minimal intensity and raw power EXCEPT for the first couple of Lemheads albums. Hate Your Friends draws a line between Husker Du and early Replacements, but has its own character. I was recently listening to this on my way to a friends funeral, and their version of ""Amazing Grace"" came on. It blew me away, and I understood what it meant to ""Hate your Friends"": all the mixed emotion and intensity of a friendship. Forget that Evan Dando was/is a heartthob, messed up individual. This album and Creator are must-haves for any fan of real punk, indy rock. This mess of a collection has only one quality - it's so short with most  songs checking in at less than 2min 30s. This must be Evan's relative who  is involved because it sure ain't him. British athlete Suzanne Dando showed  more musical prowess than this cd of garage band scraps. Hate your friends  - them send them this. This is before they hit it big with crappy ""masterpieces"" such as ""Come on, feel the lemonheads.""(if you like that album, you must be listening to too much new kids/nsync/backstreet boys). This is powerful from the first song to the last song. If you are into real, powerful, honest yet slapstick pop punk music, buy this album. But if you like bands being changed by fat cat major record labels, wimpy lyrics, songs that sound like they came out of the sixties by other ""changed by the major labels"" bands, then ""Come on, feel the lemonheads"" may be the right album for you. I don't care what the other compilation album claims to be-- This CD is the best of the Lemonheads!  The first few songs are from the excellent but out-of-print ""Laughing All the Way to the Cleaners"" album.  Almost every single song (and there are 20 of them) is amazing and sticks in your head.  Probably not for the fans of latter-day Lemonheads.  Although there are a couple of slow-tempo moments, overall, this is garage rock played at hardcore punk speed. Folks who LOOOOVE this album, then call later LEMONHEADS ""wimpy"" ""60's sounding"" and ""changed by major labels"" are obviously still in high school, or just immature and don't really like MUSIC...They like a SCENE.  Namely punk.  If it ain't fast and sloppy, then it ain't good to these folks.This record is passable garage pop.  It's fine, really.  But any actual fan of music and songwriting will say this band didn't really get cooking until their 3rd record, LICK, and didn't hit a homerun until IT'S A SHAME ABOUT RAY.And yeah, I'm actually just as big a punk fan as the folks who love this album, but that also gives me the knowledge that there's a LOT better than this in the genre.Get this if you're a fan of the LEMONHEADS and want everything they did.  Or get this if you only like one style of music; punk.Otherwise, don't start here if you're just testing the band out.  They were like 18, for chrissakes.  How good could it be? I got turned onto the Lemonheads a few years ago. This is still one of the better albums I have.

523,1021,B000000EQP,"Forget the imitators, Slapshot is THE Boston straight edge band. Anyone currently on the American Nightmare jock, take note: these guys not only did it first, but they did it louder, faster and meaner. If you can listen to this album all the way through without stomping a hole in your living room floor, you need to go buy a Sum 41 record... er, cd. Well, damn. Never heard of Slapshot? What rock have you had your head under?!? Slapshot is THE Boston hardcore band. This album represents their heyday, circa '86 to '88. These dudes used to play the Channel &amp; you -would- get yer head stomped. These dudes put on some of the best shows I have ever seen. Buy it. Nuff said. This is american Oi! the way it should be. Step on it is Slapshot's finest moment with classics like ""You're not friend of mine"", ""(Straight Edge) In your face"", ""Hang up your boots"" and the title track. Angry choruses, street punk guitar riffs without metal sound at all and the most outspoken and controversial lyrics vomited by the ever angry Choke Kelly. They have many other records out there, but with total different style: ""Sudden death overtime"" with a more mid-pace songs and towards the NYHC sound, the mid-nineteies ""Blast furnace"" and ""Unconciousness"" flirting with the groove-metal genre and their last recordings that definitively lean towards today's USHC standards.But this records is where to catch Slapshot at their purest and rawest sound. Just get it. Classic straight edge hardcore from 'back in the day' Songs like 'Ive had enough' are just as much straight edge classics as Youth of Todays 'we just might' The tracks 'Hang up your boots' and 'No guts no glory' are what Stars and Stripes should have sounded like instead of that damn awful Whitesnake sounding pile of you know what.Dont know about the later stuff and quite frankly dont want to know.  This is the only Slapshot stuff worth listening to. This CD would get four and a half stars, just for all the classics songs that are on it.  Problem is, the production value, while not terrible, lacks punch, and the recording volume is very low.  However, Slapshot's 2002 release, Slashes and Crosschecks, has all of the standout tracks from this album:  ""I've Had Enough,"" ""No Friend of Mine,"" ""Step on It,"" ""Hang Up Your Boots,"" ""No Time Left,"" and ""In Your Face,"" plus 16 other awesome Slapshot tracks.  Not only that, but the SAC tracks are rerecorded and remastered and, to my ears, completely blow away the originals.  You also get digital versions of live performances.  I'm not knockin' Step On It, it's a great album, but considering what you can get on Slashes and Crosschecks for the same amount of dough, you're better off buying SAC. Great Album!!!22 June they're playing in ATL. It's their first time playing this state. It's going to be hot as balls when they get here, hope they don't melt. Another classic of the boston hardcore scene. Slapshot is simply a great band who gives during these 14 songs to its listeners, energy, faith, and more.It's old school but, to my opinion, still valuable.

524,1022,B000000EQR,"This is the type of album that makes a big influence on your musical tastes ... if you happen to be 19 years old, which is how old I was at the time The Gift was released.Let's get a couple things straight. Firstly, this is a hard rock album that is completely unapproachable if you despise Helmet, Slint, early Lemonheads, Kiss, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Minor Threat, Husker Du, The Who, the Sex Pistols, and other bands of that ilk.If you like these groups, or even better, like being in a small club listening to band that has a perfect balance of rock tightness and energy that sends the audience into overdrive, then Bullet Lavolta will appeal to you. It may take a couple of listens, but in the end you will understand that this was a band that was dedicated and very talented.It's actually best to start at the end of the CD, as The Gift tacks on BV's first six-song EP, which I belive was released two years before, in 1987. The EP was recorded on a pretty limited budget and never released by itself on CD, but it has a lot of energy and good songs, esp. ""Over The Shoulder"" ""Because You're Mine"" and ""Dead Wrong"". It was a good decision on the part of somebody at Taang to stick it onto the end of the CD. It not only gives people more for their money, but also lets people know about the band's earliest music and first lead guitarist, Corey Loog Brennan (who later played with the Lemonheads on Lick).Going back to track one on the CD takes you to the proper Gift album, recorded in 1989. ""Crossfire"" roars out of the speakers and right away shows more maturity, not only in terms of recording (the hiss and muddled drums present on the EP are gone) but also in terms of musical development. The speed metal/thrash tendencies are replaced by the wall of guitars approach, the drums are more forceful, and the background vocals have reached the gang feel a lot of Boston bands at the time (Gang Green, Slapshot spring to mind) were expressing.One song on the CD has two versions: ""Birth Of Death."" The first (studio) version of this evil tune is the best. The thick drums, chunky guitar/bass rhythm and the sinister squeal of the wah-wah lead are marvelous. Gipe's vocals rise to the occaision - ""My soul full of holes!"" he screams at one point, and you feel the energy behind the song.Unfortunately, the live recording of the same song seems pretty thin by comparison. It's a pity, because live BV was great. I saw them all over the Boston area from 87 - 90, and they really influenced by tastes in music and attitudes toward songwriting. This song does not reflect the live concerts I remember at The Rat, TT's, and Bunratties, where a hard-core fan base of at least 50-100 people could be found at every show singing along to all the songs, even before some of them had been recorded!Instead, the live ""Birth of Death"" sounds a little hoarse, and at one point Gipe starts in too early, is forced to correct himself.Other than that, The Gift is a beautiful piece of work. I believe BV came and went five years too early - had they reached the peak of their live and recorded talents in 1994 instead of 1989, they would have ended up being appreciated by a much larger group of fans...","Alternative Rock,Indie Rock,Indie & Lo-Fi,Metal,Pop,Adult Alternative,Rock",type makes big influence musical tastes happen years old old time gift released lets get couple things straight firstly hard rock completely unapproachable despise helmet slint early lemonheads kiss bachman turner overdrive minor threat husker du sex pistols bands ilk like groups even better like small club listening band perfect balance rock tightness energy sends audience overdrive bullet lavolta appeal may take couple listens end understand band dedicated talented actually best start end cd gift tacks bvs first six ep belive released two years ep recorded pretty limited budget never released cd lot type influence musical tastes happen years old old old time time gift released lets things straight firstly hard hard rock rock completely unapproachable despise helmet early lemonheads kiss bachman turner overdrive overdrive minor minor threat threat husker du du sex sex pistols pistols bands ilk groups better club listening band perfect perfect balance balance rock tightness energy sends audience bullet bullet lavolta lavolta appeal couple listens end understand band dedicated talented actually best start end cd gift tacks ep belive released years ep ep recorded recorded pretty limited budget released cd lot
525,1023,B000000EQX,"i think this record proves that most bands that turn out great,such as the lemonheads.already have had great music out before there best known hit.this album-""lick---proves that theory true.give this record a try,if you dont like-ill let you kick me in my teeth!lol! This is a good disc to add to a Lemonheads collection.  It has a few songs from the first Lemonheads full length and some really good pop style punk. one of the best records i ever listened. The cd sleeve details the sorry situation of the band at this point as  internecine conflict breaks out. Only the cover of &quot;luka&quot; makes  this a point of curiousty. If you like the later work then you will likely  find this a thrashy unrecognisable mess. That was my thought when I first bought this album in college. I listened to it for five months. It is one of my favorite albums in my collection and I still listen to it on and off. ""luka"" is a great remake of an annoying song and ""those were the days"", some of the lyrics are from TV show ""All in the family"" (just watch the opening credits.). Their next album after this one is ""It's a shame about ray"", So this album is one out of four lemonheads albums (along with creator and hate your friends) where Dando and Co.still remain true to their roots. This is the early years.and the early years was the most powerful lemonheads period ever.it's a must own....the rapidly budding Dando [flexes] a burgeoning [songwriting] talent....the real killer here is `Luka,' a wired rewrite of Suzanne Vega's ghastly, mawkish hit; [shows a] talent for melancholy recontextualisation of the oddest source material. While I much prefer the first two albums to this one, Lick is still a pretty good record.  Sadly, there's much less noise, urgency, and punkish energy on this record than their earlier ones but, again, compared to the long line of crappy releases that followed this, Lick is still a lot better.  I'm willing to bet that if you love the later mellower Lemonheads sound, you probably won't like Lick.  Personally, I feel that after this record the quality of the Lemonheads music took a huge nosedive and has never recovered.  Thanks a lot Evan Dando! It still holds up more than 10 years and dozens of listenings later.  The songs are catchy and clever with a punk edge and a sense of humor.  None of it is filler and &quot;Luka&quot; alone is worth the price of admission. But if you are a fan of the &quot;Into Your Arms&quot;-type pop songs, you might not like this.  I think it was all downhill from this point.  If you do like this, check out &quot;Creator&quot; and &quot;Hate your Friends&quot;, forget the later stuff. Almost every other track on The Lemonheads third outing, ""Lick"", is a memorable slice of proto-grunge in the vein of other punk-influenced artists from the late '80s and early '90s such as Nirvana and Dinosaur Jr. The other half isn't quite up to snuff. This is due in large part to the dual songwriting credit. Evan Dando, who would eventually head the band, manages to both pen the catchiest tunes as well as deliver the most appealing vocal performances, delivering the goods on both fast and angsty numbers like ""Glad I Don't Know"" as well as on mid-tempo numbers like the haunting ""Circle of One"" and their legendary cover of Suzanne Vega's ""Luka"". Founding member Ben Deily isn't quite so lucky. His songs chug along on generic guitar riffs that are totally par for the course for an underground band in the wake of Sonic Youth in the late '80s, and his prepubescent-sounding voice and seemingly nonsensical lyrics don't help.If you're a fan of bands like the aforementioned Nirvana and Dinosaur Jr., or of lo-fi acts like Pavement then I highly recommend that you give ""Lick"" a listen. It's good, messy fun.","Alternative Rock,American Alternative,Pop,Adult Alternative,Rock,Hardcore & Punk,Punk-Pop",think record proves bands turn great lemonheads already great best known hit lick proves theory true give record try dont like ill let kick teeth lol good disc add lemonheads collection first lemonheads full length really good pop style punk one best records ever listened cd sleeve details sorry situation band point internecine conflict breaks cover quot luka quot makes point curiousty like later work likely find thrashy unrecognisable mess thought first bought college listened five months one favorite collection still listen luka great remake annoying days lyrics tv show think record proves bands turn great lemonheads great best known hit lick proves theory true record try ill let kick teeth good disc add lemonheads collection full full length length really good pop style punk best records listened cd sleeve details sorry situation band point conflict breaks cover quot point later work likely find thrashy unrecognisable mess thought bought college listened months favorite collection listen great remake annoying days lyrics tv tv show show

528,1028,B000000ERS,"...and glad I did.  It was the song that got me into the MMBT.  The others are covers that are on the ""punk"" side of ska - meh This EP just... well... rocks!  &quot;Where'd You Go?&quot; and &quot;Do Something Crazy&quot; are two of the Bosstones' best songs, but if that was all this had to offer, then you ALMOST might as well just pick up  &quot;More Noise...&quot; and &quot;Devil's Night Out&quot; (two great CDs,  BTB).  But it's the three covers that make this EP great.  If the cover of  &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; doesn't display how phenomenal the rhythm section  of this band is, then check out the speed metal cover of &quot;Sweet  Emotion&quot;.  (And if you don't find the concept of a speed metal cover  of &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; irresistable, maybe you should seek help.) And  &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love&quot; shows what Van Halen could have been  if they'd had an ounce of soul and rhythm to go with their technical  virtuousity.  Beyond just changing the tempos, they added lyrics (some  howlingly funny) and put together innovative arrangements to give the songs  a very distinctive Bosstones edge.

529,1029,B000000ERV,"I have had the Brotherhood lp since around 1989-90. For two decades now I have heard the stories about DYS's second lp, Fire & Ice, and how bad it was. I knew the rumors about how rock/metal it was and that it resembled nothing to the seminal Brotherhood lp. I'm going to quote from another reviewer: ""you're better off never hearing the diabolical ""fire and ice"" album and the 4 extra tracks that make up ""wolfpack"" aren't even funny for the first listen.""Well said. After 20 years, I have heard it myself and it's worse than what others have said about it. Fire & Ice is truely awful. Is that really Dave Smallee (not spelled Smalley on the jacket) on vocals. I mean, who is that behind that wretched noise on vocals. I am a huge Smalley fan (already pre-ordered the new DBL album).The only reason I got this combo cD is because A. it was really cheap & B. I have always actually wanted to hear the much maligned Fire & Ice album. Now that I have, I wished I had not. It's hard to listen to the Botherhood lp in the same light again. This CD has everything DYS put out. A lot of people put down ""Fire & Ice"" for being too Metally, but there are a few straight-up Hardcore Punk(The Loner, Held Back, etc...)blasts here. Obviously, the songs that were originally on the ""Brotherhood"" EP(Now on a separate CD)are by far the best songs they did, but since all this fits on one CD, this two-on-one disc should have stayed in print. Buy this, and simply program the ""Brotherhood"" tracks in your CD player and you'll be all set!! ""Brotherhood"" ep aka ""wolfpack"" album = 5 stars, ""D.Y.S"" album aka ""fire and ice"" album and ""wolfpack"" outtake songs = 2 stars. 3 stars for the package overall since over half of the cd is unnecessary.So, the ""brotherhood"" ep by D.Y.S is of the greatest examples of early eighties hardcore not just from Boston but hardcore period. And so influential since every Youth Crew band got their whole style from D.Y.S. ""Brotherhood"" got the reissue treatment in 1991 as ""wolfpack"" and had four appalling studio session songs tagged on at the end including a cringeworthy comedy faux-reggae track called ""rub a dub"" and a lousy cover of ""iron man"" by 'Sabbath alongside the second eponymous D.Y.S album where they went metal which bacame ""fire on ice"" for a discography cd called ""fire and ice""/""wolfpack"". You could argue that it's value for money, perhaps, but you're better off never hearing the diabolical ""fire and ice"" album and the 4 extra tracks that make up ""wolfpack"" aren't even funny for the first listen. It's fair to say you aren't living your life in false happiness if you're a D.Y.S fan who's never heard them.Really, everything you need to hear is on the short but sharp ""brotherhood"" ep, now finally issued on it's own on cd and available from Amazon.","Alternative Rock,American Alternative,Straight Edge,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore,Hardcore & Punk",brotherhood lp since around two decades heard stories dyss second lp fire ice bad knew rumors rock metal resembled nothing seminal brotherhood lp im going quote another reviewer youre better never hearing diabolical fire ice extra make wolfpack arent even funny first listen well said years heard worse others said fire ice truely awful really dave smallee spelled smalley jacket vocals mean behind wretched noise vocals huge smalley fan already pre ordered new dbl reason got combo cd really cheap b always actually wanted hear much maligned fire ice wished hard listen botherhood lp light cd everythi brotherhood lp decades heard stories second lp fire ice bad knew rumors rock metal resembled seminal brotherhood lp quote reviewer youre better hearing diabolical fire ice extra wolfpack arent funny listen said years heard worse said fire ice awful really spelled jacket vocals mean wretched noise vocals huge fan ordered new reason got combo cd really cheap actually wanted hear maligned fire ice wished hard listen lp light cd
530,1030,B000000ESP,"It's just plain and simple.  This is a really good cd.  I love it.  I get a kick out of the song &quot;Bad in Plaid&quot;, it's awesome!  I also like the song &quot;Cowboy Coffee&quot;.  If you're ready for some heavy ska,  then this is the cd for you.  It drives my mom crazy!!  So get ready to  turn your stereo up full blast and party!!  Okay, you might want to get  some friends over first.  But, hey, I like noise that's why I'm livin'  where I am. This album is the most perfect Bosstones album, though I liked &quot;Devil's night out&quot; (and need to buy a new copy), it was quite rough. This one, just great. Picture it's fall 1994. You are a loser working in a factory, sitting in your sweet 1993 Candy Apple Red Nissan Sentra, and you make every person that walks by your car hear &quot;Doctor D&quot;, and you play that album for every person you take to the fast food joint on break. Resitance is futile!! Ska is better than alt-rock on the radio.  You must comply!!! Love the Ska!!Love me!!! Also, if you want to turn somebody onto ska, please play &quot;I'll drink to that&quot; after, well, they have a drink. Frat-boy fun!! It is uncharacteristic of me to write a review on an album like this, but I have to, because it's good! This was one of the first and only ska albums I ever had, along with Skankin' Pickle and a handfull of others.  &quot;More Noise...&quot; is fantastic.  I ended up buying their next couple albums, only to be very dissapointed. This album stands alone, in my mind, as the only good Bosstones album. I feel so old writing this review - and feel SO sorry for anyone that didn't get the chance to catch these guys live back in the 90s.  Simply put, best damn live show you will ever see (next to the Supersuckers).  ""More Noises"" is by far the best the Bosstones have to offer...and Dicky and the boys, if you are reading this: PLEASE get back together for a small venue reunion tour.  I'll drink to that!!!! I have been listening to the Bosstones for about 13 years maybe 12.  I have seen them live countless times.  From large venue (Horde tour, Warp Tour) type festivals to club shows.  If they ever play a club near you jump at the chance to go. Don't skip to see them on a large stage, just don't get all hyped up it will be a let down.  Nothing to do with the Band they sound great, just not the same type of atmosphere as the club gigs.The last time I saw them was I believe 2000 or 2001 at the 9:30 Club in D.C. (great venue by the way)  One of the best - not quite as good as when they were younger but still one the best shows ever for that size of a club.More Noise and Other Disturbances is a good album, but Live from the Middle East really captures the energy and feel of a live Bosstone show.  I really have a hard time listening to their studio albums.  On a one to five rating More Noise and Other Disturbances gets a 5, while Live from the Middle East would get an 8 on the same rating scale.  Absolutley the best, off the chart. I don't care what category one may wish to apply to the Bosstones, this album is just great music! Every song is great, the best Bosstones album in my opinion. If you buy only one Bosstones album make it this one or maybe ""Live From the Middle East"". My criteria for any ska record is simple: does it make me jump out of my chair and start skanking wildly as if my life depended on it? With Noises, the answer is a resounding yes, even six years after I first heard of the  bosstones.The trend in the latter half of the ninetees was to have  bands that did either happy pop-ska, or run-of-the-mill punk-ska. Although  they combine  a hardcore background with singable ska songs, the Bosstones  really don't fit into either category; this record showcases their  distinctive sound better than their other records. The sound is aggressive  and FAST, especially on Dr. D and What's At STake, but then you have  where'd you go and They Came to Boston, which may not be  &quot;hardcore&quot; but maintain the high level of energy. This album  stands out from all other ska albums by far. If you buy only one Bosstones  CD, get this one, but you're going to want more. Let's keep this one short and sweet.  More Noise and Other Disturbances is probably the most solid Ska-Core album to date.  Gritty, Raw, Melodic, this album will rock your socks off. This has become my favorite Bosstones album, bumping 'Let's Face It' to a very close second.  'I'll Drink To That' is probably my favorite Bosstones song.  In fact, the first seven tracks on this album are fantastic, with the only slowdown occuring at the start of 'Guns And The Young'.  It almost seems awkward to have the Bosstones delivering a serious message.  Aren't these guys just about partying and ripping through their unique blend of ska-punk-rock?  Nevertheless, a very excellent outing and definitely the first album I would recommend for purchase to anyone getting into the Bosstones. I started listening to the bosstones when Let's Face It came out and even though it's an amazing album More Noise and Other Disturbances is the kind of album that you will play again and again and again.Every bosstones full length has it's own sound and this is no exception as all the tracks are catchy but also make you think at the same time.If you've only heard some of their more recent stuff you'll be glad you picked this up.

That's also assuming musical talent and authentic creativity were rewarded.I am a fairly ADD type who loves to listen to complex music like Polvo, MBV, King Crimson, Yes...  and the Swirlies fit right in.As a lover of organized 'wall-of-sound guitar', just the intro to the song 'Jeremy Parker' is worth the price of the album.  It's still stunning to me after a decade of listening to it. This album typifies nineties indy rock.  The Swirlies were way ahead of their time when this album came out in 1993.  Sonic Youth's spacier tendencies collide with The Pixies' male-female vocal harmonies in a back alley full of angry guitars. Loud. Abrasive. Sumptuous.  Ethereal.

535,1036,B000000EU5,"There's no such thing as a bad Screamfeeder album, unless you have a major thing against classy, emotional and genuine indie rock, and songwriting that doesn't come this good in the context of today's throwaway alternative  rock. even back in the day this album stood out from so many Dinosaur Jr  wannabes then clogging up bargain bins of record stores - and today it just  sounds like a classic.

So why  isn't this already in your record collection? Fifteen years  ago, Screamfeerder played a gig at a small northern coastal Australian city. I met the female bass player on the beach before the gig. She seemed like a nice girl, but was trying to sell her band like an Am-Way representative. Never a fan of the band, i tried to cut her off at the pass and talk to her in my very best John Wayne accent which failed to discourage her, and later on that night i attended the gig. Screamfeeder  churned out a grungy feedback style rock n roll that was slow, repetitive and as pleasing as pancreatic cancer. I told the band as much also. So  many years later Snicko on advise from his mental health counselor, and the board of directors at Am-Way Australia have recommended i apologize to the band for any pain and suffering caused and wish to offer the band a 7% discount on their next 44 gallon drum of blast off toilet bowl cleaner when purchased during our upcoming Christmas clean out.","Alternative Rock,Punk Revival,Punk,Pop,Adult Alternative,Rock,Hardcore & Punk",theres thing bad screamfeeder unless major thing classy emotional genuine indie rock songwriting doesnt come good context todays throwaway alternative rock even back day stood many dinosaur jr wannabes clogging bargain bins record stores today sounds like classic shame taang records sitting gem without anything hey even got evan dando stamp approval least knows got beat cameo appearance isnt already record collection fifteen years ago screamfeerder played gig small northern coastal australian city met female bass player beach gig seemed like nice girl trying sell band like way representative never fan band tried cut pass talk best john wayne accent failed discourage bad screamfeeder major classy emotional genuine indie indie rock rock come good context todays throwaway alternative alternative rock rock day stood dinosaur dinosaur jr jr wannabes clogging bargain bargain bins bins record record stores stores today sounds classic shame taang taang records records sitting gem got evan evan dando stamp approval knows got beat cameo cameo appearance appearance isnt record collection collection years years ago played gig northern coastal australian city met female bass bass player player beach gig seemed nice nice girl girl trying sell band way representative fan band tried cut pass talk best john accent failed discourage
536,1038,B000000EUF,"These songs sound quite different from one another.  'San Cristobal' rocks as much as any metal, some verges on stereolab's french vocal harmonies (if recorded in a wind tunnel), and a few also echo Stereolab's early guitar chords.  Sunn begins with some interesting guitar chord overlays reminiscent of Glenn Branca's guitar orchestras (which ye experimental guitarists may have tried in your own bands), but proceeds on into a coherent song with a different sound (not atypical for swirlies).  There are shades of Sonic Youth in here as well... rich, complex, diverse.And you've got to love the album title, whatever it means.As I said in my review of Blonde-Adder Baton, this band should be famous and fabulously rich. Having finally caught up with this album just recently ($8.50, used, at Everyday Music here in Portland) I was fairly SHOCKED that I -- and whomever else -- could have ""missed"" this one during its initial ""impact"" in the '90s.The Swirlies (yes, they're named after the practice of taking someone's head and sticking it in the toilet and subjecting them to enduring a ""flush"" -- ""The Wedgies"" would have been less ""classy,"" don't you think?) are the one band I can think of who have, shall we say, a DISCERNIBLE My Bloody Valentine influence ... which is the OPPOSITE of a ""bad"" thing.Any number of bands (Ladytron, Lush, pretty-much-everyone-else-too) can -- even ""plausibly"" -- claim a lineage from Kevin Shields & Co., but the Swirlies more ""demonstrably"" take a page from the ""Loveless"" book and go a few more steps up the ladder (to mix my metaphors a bit) ... as though the whole concept of ""tremolo"" applied not just to rocking the fretboard (&agrave; la Hair Metal's ""whammy bar"" usage), but to slowing down ""time"" and hopping ""time signatures"" -- let alone ""keys"" and ""key constraints"" -- to come up with ... what?Something that ... well, SLIDES BETWEEN the normal ""frets"" we use to separate notes in Western, 12-step music phrasing ... finding the ""spaces"" just in the middle of them!PLUS: So help me, for anyone who was there, it SOUNDS like Boston/'90s/Adrian-Tomine-esque ""spaces"" which are ""homey"" to those who came of age under the ""Boomer Burden"" of Grateful Death(tm) worship and rampant Jon (""INSTANT KARMIC-RIBBON-BURNING"") Lemon-ism ... someplace both more ambitious/daring and yet ... confidently comfortable & sane in its own skin?I love this album.  If you haven't heard it yet, I'm (currently) better off than you.  (You can easily CHANGE that, though!)The future beckons ...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[*] NOT UNLIKE:In Prism...Sisterworld...Velocifero...Our Love to Admire...The Fragile...Amnesiac... orThe Eternal, say! why is it whenever someone plays a guitar with a tremelo bar, people just automatically say &quot;he sounds like Kevin Shields&quot; or &quot;they sound like My Bloody Valentine&quot;? (Did people compare MBV to Link Wray?  ) This album sounds nothing like Loveless, or Isn't Anything. To say that  it does is just an insult to both bands. The music of the Swirlies and MBV  runs much deeper than trivial material comparisons. The Swirlies had, and  always will have a unique sound. More delicate records from the shoegaze era are usually graffitied with descriptors like ""dreamlike"" and ""ethereal."" ""Nowhere"" by Ride is a breezy ""what if"" run-through that tries to approximate what the Beach Boys or the Byrds might sound like underwater. Going on what the star chamber of over fifteen years' worth of critics have said, My Bloody Valentine's ""Loveless"" is supposed to sound like being in love. If either of those description are accurate, then ""They Spent Their Wild Youthful Days in the Glittering World of the Salons"" must be like trying hard to remember being in love. Underwater. With a Frenchman.A brief spin of the dial on a ""French Radio"" and you can almost hear your brain's remembrance gears start to turn. Clock-tick drumwork and odd, clanking-yet-shimmering guitar chords back up androgynous baby lullaby vocals on the opener ""In Harmony Newfound Freedom,"" which brings to mind Danish space-rockers Mew. Modern day proteges? ""In Harmony"" sheds light on the stylistic underpinnings of the album and the Swirlies sound. But as the band later point out, you must hear it for yourself. You'd be hard pressed to call ""Their Wild Youthful Days"" delicate, aggressive, dissonant or musical with much certainty. They're somehow all of the above, at once.""San Cristobal"" comes off like a metal band that couldn't afford the right amps or a guest appearance from the Cookie Monster. Elsewhere, the introductory riff on ""Two Girls Kissing"" could easily be mistaken for an obscure Fugazi/Evens vamp... that is, until the drenched guitars clobber their way to the front, dragging up flutey, very un-McKaye choirboy vox by the hair with them. Other bits are even weirder. The cutesy ""You Can't Be Told It, You Must Behold It"" is based on a basso synth voice repeatedly scatting ""bee-baa, bee-baa"" in true Daft Punk spirit. A bit later, the record takes a more obvious intermission in the form of the found sound street recording ""Do Any of You Know Anything About Love?"" There's a brief primer on theremins and ring modulators in ""Boys, Protect Yourself From Aliens"" which is followed up by the coy pendulum-swinging ""Sunn,"" full of distant bleeps and blips and gooey synthesizer portamento during the quiet bits and a pronounced drumbeat in the ""a bit louder"" bits. It finally starts to really gallop at about 3:50.But even when these guys ""take off,"" it's using some kind of screwloose engine that probably didn't pass government inspection. While never relying on more traditional pop hooks to wire with guitar pedals (like Ride's ""Nowhere""), ""Their Wild Youthful Days"" feels confusing, and not in the same floaty, rush-of-endorphins, one-hand-on-the-whammy-bar way as ""Loveless."" My Bloody Valentine's masterpiece was built upon simple melodies and chord progressions that would sound just as brilliant (albeit different) in a folky acoustic arrangement. One can't honestly say the same about a record as dense and complex as ""Their Wild Youthful Days.""More Blonde Redhead than Cocteau Twins. More Sonic Youth than Slowdive. If this is dreampop, it's the stuff of dreams fueled by way too much Mexican food before bed. Although maybe it's more LSD than MSG. A landmark full length for my record collection.  This came out in 1995 and I have yet to hear another modern pop sound as thoughtful and flawless as this.  Melding early synthesizers and electronics, brilliant sounding drums and guitars, and three dimensional vocal melodies, this had the same effect on me as The Beatles ""Revolver"", Beach Boys ""Smile"", and the Zombies ""Odyssey Oracle"".  Every song is a gem but like the other records I listed, a complete (and ambitious) thought. ""They Spent Their Wild Youthful Days..."" lies somewhere between My Bloody Valentine's ""Loveless"" and the synthesized bliss of Stereolab - lush layers of guitar blend seamlessly with electronic  keyboards to weave a soundscape most American bands haven't yet been  capable of creating. The vocals are, much like MBV, sometimes nearly  incomprehensible, but the sonic sweets are sure to make you forget about  deciphering lyrics. Every song on this album is *perfect* - buy it now! This album is so good, I bought a second copy that I keep shrink wrapped for whenever my first copy becomes unplayable. All the Swirlies' catalog is worth checking out, but this album is their pinnacle. Best experienced as a whole rather than picking out individual songs, its overall effect is quite powerful. Combining the sounds of shoegaze with Sonic Youth-style noise and psych folk experimentalism, this band created a sound all their own, at its idiosyncratic best on ""They Spent Their Wild Youthful Days in the Glittering World of the Salons."" I would file them in my ""beautiful noise"" category. If you like My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth, His Name is Alive and Neutral Milk Hotel, buy this album. This album is very good. Creative and accessible, only the slightly tinny production holds it back. Silky vocals adorn the clean soundscapes, intermixed with bursts of chunky dirt. Without coming across as intentionally ""indie"", the band refuses to be ordinary. It takes guts and talent to achieve this with the seemingly effortless grace they display here. Their dynamics vary greatly, but they never lose sight of the album's common thread: complicated, tight writing inside cunningly likeable songs. There's a theme here that almost every artist under the radar shoots for. Most fall short, but it's because of their impure motives.","Alternative Rock,Shoegazing,Vocal Pop,Indie Rock,Indie & Lo-Fi,Lo-Fi,Dream Pop,Pop,British Alternative,Adult Alternative,Rock,American Alternative",sound quite different one another san cristobal rocks much metal verges stereolabs french vocal harmonies recorded wind tunnel also echo stereolabs early guitar chords sunn begins interesting guitar chord overlays reminiscent glenn brancas guitar orchestras ye experimental guitarists may tried bands proceeds coherent different sound atypical swirlies shades sonic youth well rich complex diverse youve got love title whatever means said review blonde adder baton band famous fabulously rich finally caught recently used everyday portland fairly shocked whomever else could missed one initial impact swirlies yes theyre named practice taking someones head sticking toilet sound quite different san rocks metal verges stereolabs french vocal vocal harmonies harmonies recorded wind wind tunnel tunnel echo stereolabs early guitar guitar chords chords sunn begins interesting guitar guitar chord chord overlays reminiscent glenn glenn brancas brancas guitar orchestras experimental guitarists tried bands proceeds coherent different sound atypical swirlies shades sonic sonic youth youth rich complex diverse got got love love title means said review blonde adder baton band famous fabulously rich finally caught recently used everyday fairly shocked whomever missed initial impact swirlies practice head sticking toilet

I recommend this CD to fellow 80's Punk Rockers like myself. A very good band in the old California scene (with the likes of the Circle Jerks, Lost Cause, Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies, etc. etc.) There sound is great, mixed up with a little bit of a rock and roll influence that the Hardcore scene of today has left out. They even pay homage to the Great Motorhead, and one of the reviews before mine was right they do it better than them. They have a lot of passion and anger put into there music with out the need write lyrics that sound &quot;tough&quot;. They were the best Hardcore band out of California in 80's scene in my opinion.Throw these guys into the basket of under rated old hardcore bands with the likes of Articles of Faith, Negative Approach, Die Kreuzen, the Nihilistics, and so many more. Black Flag, the Dead Kennedys werent everything back then. The biggest and best out of the early San Diego scene- ever present throughtout the early days and easily the hardest charging and most diligent of any San Diego punk band to date. Agreed they could back it up- there was no empty talk with this crew and it shows in the sincerety and outright hard edged, angry punk rock. By the late eighties after tons of lineups they'd pretty well been all over the map and had shown that San Diego could spawn a punk band that could drive legendary bands like Discharge and SS Decontrol step it up a notch. Completely sincere and slamming the point home every time- these guys completely personify the early days of Southern California hardcore. If you don't have the Fighting boys E.P. and second coming, your collection is incomplete. A chunk o' great, great hardcore from the time when men were men, and wimpy bands like the offspring and rage against yo' momma were still piddling in their diapers.This is full strength hardcore from a bunch of  guys who walked it like they talked it.

This album is one big train wreck. I really can't write a long review about it because there isn't much to say. The songs are watered down ska at its worst. It feels like they are just trying to throw something together to get money, not to make good songs. I didn't mind ska before, but this band is why ska gets such a bad rap. Stay away from this album.

You will not regret it. this is the bench mark. it doesnt get much better then the business and this is one of if not their best album fans of the business will enjoy this album. the songs have a harder edge than &quot;welcome to the real world&quot; and is pretty close to the sound of &quot;we want the truth...&quot;. lyrics are of the standard  street-punk/poliical stuff. the album holds classics like harry may,  suburban rebels, blind justice, and drinking and driving. if you like to  drink, sing along or are just a plain hooligan then get this album. The Business is the first Oi band that I have ever listened to. They are pretty good and I think that the singer has a heavy british accent when he sings. It's kind of hard to find that in any other band (the Subhumans was the only one I knew of that had this). Drinking and Driving is simply genius. I'm sure that nobody has thought about that back in those days. get this first. I like them because they are British Punk, I kind of ignore that whole skinhead thing.","Alternative Rock,Punk,Pop,Rock,Hardcore,Hardcore & Punk",greatest oi ever showing working class rock n roll roots made genre appealing punks skins sham started play lame pop business came along saved oi genre still living today like suburban rebels guttersnipe best oi ever recorded bonus great well consider fan punk oi pick regret bench mark doesnt get much better business one best fans business enjoy harder edge quot welcome real world quot pretty close sound quot want truth quot lyrics standard street punk poliical stuff holds classics like harry may suburban rebels blind justice drinking driving like drink sing along plain hooligan get business greatest oi showing working working class class class rock rock rock n roll roll roots genre appealing punks skins sham started play lame pop business came came along saved oi genre living today suburban rebels guttersnipe best oi recorded bonus great consider fan punk oi pick regret bench bench mark mark better business best fans business enjoy edge quot welcome real real world world quot pretty close sound quot want truth quot lyrics standard street street punk punk stuff holds classics harry suburban rebels blind justice drinking driving drink sing sing along plain hooligan business
541,1047,B000000EV8,"Anti-Heroes have been around for a long time.  And they have always played the best &quot;In your face&quot; Streetpunk.  They are opinionated and rude (But show me a skin or punk who is'nt), and they are NOT racist.  They believe in American Pride and working class.  A.H. play fast and agressive punk, Mark screams with vindication and the songs are inteligent.  For some of their older stuff check out &quot;Dont Tread on me&quot; Ox is an idiot. The AHs are not fascist or racist! ""Murder One"" is about a specific murder in Atlanta. The only thing he is remotely correct about is the AHs are a bit homophobic. I, in no way, support that particular ignorance. However, if you're going to slag a band at least know what the *bleep* you're upset about! If you like American Oi/street punk, you will not be put-off by anything these guys say...Moreover, if you like Oi/street punk, it doesn't get any better. Ox, get your ""stuff"" straight before you rip a band. Jeez, at least have the minimum intelligence to know what you're upset about (and for crying out loud, use spellcheck!). Anti-Heroes have been my last baston for solid punk music for a few years now. The rest are eather dead or broke up years ago. Since they're a local Atlanta band catching one of their shows on the weekend was a common ritual.My best decription has always been, imagine Sam Kinison fronting a Oi! band. Mark has a voice that could tear through sheet metal. Thats a good thing btw. And i'll side with some of the less ignorant reviews here, they are NOT nazis and they are NOT racists. I've met black fans at their shows and they didn't catch any grief from anyone.That said, American Pie is a must have for anyone that is frustrated with the overabundence of pop-punk that is in the mainstream nowdays. And even those of you that can't live without your pop-punk, step up and check out a solid band that has a message without a pushy agenda. This isn't Maria Cabel by the way - it's her husband Cabel.  Anyway,  I've got all the AH stuff and they're one of my favorite bands.  American Pie is my personal favorite AH album.  More politically oriented than their previous efforts this one has several songs that qualify as anthems in my opinion.  The Anti Heros are what the Dropkick Murphys can only dream of being - a real American punk band.  FYI - they are in no way whatsoever racist.  Forget the Dropkick Murphys - this is the real deal.  Also pick up &quot;Underneath The Undergound&quot;.  Cabel Traditional hardcore, mixed with oi and punk and you get a very solid offering with this record/cd. Thought-provoking and humerous lyrics through out. Starts strong with The Tradition and ends strong with controversy (a  smashing Patti Smith cover, but you'll have to buy the record to hear it)  This is highly recommended.  No disappointments here. Add this to your  collection, although you should already own this since it is Y2K as I write  this! To be honest, after I had heard several Anti Heroes songs I was pleased. I Figured: &quot;This makes Oi look good&quot;, and I bought the cd. Unfortunatly, all the songs I had heard were the ones that didnt show the  real Anti Heroes; the racist, homophobic nazi side of them. I about broke  my stereo when I heard the lyrics to one of their songs, and i quote:  &quot;Scum like you dont deserve to live free I think you look good hanging  from a tree No remorse when you delt all the spades Hope you get raped in  jail and die of aids&quot; Such lyrics make me sick. the song &quot;Return  to Manzanar&quot; is primarily about sending Japanese Americans to  concentration camps and the only songs they ever cover are &quot;White  Riot&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Nigger&quot;. If you are a real punk or  rudeboy you will avoid this trash. I hope this opens some of your eyes. The Anti-Heroes are one of the greatest Oi! bands of all time and ""Amercian Pie"" is the best Anti-Heroes yet. The politically charged lyrics in songs like ""Heros and Zeroes"" and ""Murder one"" make this music rise above most of the crap put out by the mainstream today. I think its sad when people like Ox say that the the Anti-heroes are racist when they do not bother to understand the meaning of the song in the first place, Please do us all favor and stick to the libral, politically correct bands like ""NOFX"" and ""Sum 41"" and leave the Oi! to us.If you dig ""Anti-Heroes"" I recomend ""Drop Kick Murphys"" and ""The Brusers"" The Anti-heroes are punk in it's finest form. They know how to get down to business without wasting your time. With intelligent lyrics and rocking music, they keep you thinking as well as dancing.","Alternative Rock,Hardcore & Punk,Punk,Pop,Rock",anti heroes around long time always played best quot face quot streetpunk opinionated rude show skin punk isnt racist believe american pride working class h play fast agressive punk mark screams vindication inteligent older stuff check quot dont tread quot ox idiot ahs fascist racist murder one specific murder atlanta thing remotely correct ahs bit homophobic way support particular ignorance however youre going slag band least know bleep youre upset like american oi street punk put anything guys say moreover like oi street punk doesnt get better ox get stuff straight rip band jeez least minimum intelligence know youre upset c anti anti heroes heroes long long time time played best quot face quot streetpunk opinionated rude show skin punk racist believe american american pride pride working working class class play fast punk mark screams vindication older stuff check quot tread ox idiot ahs fascist racist murder murder one specific murder atlanta remotely correct ahs bit homophobic way support ignorance slag band know bleep youre upset american oi street street punk punk guys say oi street street punk punk get better better ox stuff straight rip band jeez minimum intelligence know youre upset
542,1049,B000000EXF,"This album is fantastic the whole way through with not one weak cut. However, one song rises above and is utterly transcendent. &quot;Willie&quot; is one of the greatest songs ever to come out of Texas, or anywhere for that matter. It is an absolute masterpiece of conciseness, gorgeous melody, and literary metaphor of the highest caliber. Somehow I convinced myself that REK was an artist I had to get to know better.  I bought a few of his albums, including this one, but quickly (as in, pretty much right away) tired of his voice.  He writes some good songs, but others do a better job singing them. Another REK Masterpiece.  Include in this great work is ""The Front Porch Song,"" one of Keen's most popular and this album does not dissappoint with its version of it either.  ""Rollin' By"" and the title track ""No Kinda Dancer"" are both excellent as well.  A must have for any fan of Texas Country Music. REK's best studio CD and almost as good as No. 2 Live Dinner. ""No Kinda Dancer"" almost certainly won't be your first Robert Earl Keen purchase (odds are favoring close to 100% on that), but it may well end up being your favorite.  As of the follow up (""West Textures"") Keen would already have his songwriting down to a marketable formula (although one of the best and least exhaustible formalae there is), but here he does what he does best without an inkling of how it's going to go over, and there's a purity in that which cannot be found on any of his subsequent albums.The only thing that deliberately points toward his future progression is ""Keep Swervin' In My Lane"", an enjoyable if somewhat lightweight metaphor for the obstacles Keen is constantly having to reckon with.  It's a decent song, mind you, but unlike the rest of the album it does have a sort of self-awareness about it, as if it were written specifically for crowd appeal rather than telling an honest tale or exorcising demons, the hallmark of his best (if not his most popular) work.The title track doesn't seem to get much play this late in the songbook, which is a shame, because it illustrates Keen's knack for infusing tossaway subjects with vivid detail, an almost Flaubertian ideal in it's literary descriptiveness of a fairly mundane scene.  This is one complaint that I have about the reissue:  the cover photo is obviously taken from the same photo sessions as the original, but whereas the first pressing showed Keen out on a dancefloor looking down at his boots - in keeping with the two-stepping shyness inherent in the song's lyrics - the reissue has him out on the same dancefloor, but this time looking at the camera and grinning.  Somehow it just doesn't have the same appeal.  Particularly since the reissue looks just as cheap, if not cheaper, than the original 1984 cover art!  You'd think in this age where every Photoshop hack can create a reasonably attractive CD cover they could have done better, but what the hell:  it's still a great album and they more than make up for it with the previously unreleased bonus tracks.""The Front Porch Song"" was co-written by Lyle Lovett, and though the studio version on this album is fine in it's own right, you'll still need to pick up ""The Live Album"" for the must-have live version, which interjects a spoken word segment detailing the years Keen spent rooming with Lyle Lovett (Lovett's version is called ""This Old Porch"") - including a great bit about his landlord - and is completely worth the price of that album in and of itself.  No Keen collection is complete without it.Another of the Lovett co-writes, ""Rolling By"", is one of Keen's great world-weary anthems to the estranged.  It's as good an indication of any why Keen is as popular as he is:  while the trials and travails of his characters could generally apply to anyone, the details are specifically Texan.  There is something about the great expanse of the Lone Star State and it's geographical segue from the old plantation country of West Louisiana/East Texas, the oil field coasts of the Gulf and the hills of Central Texas to the Rio Grande valley and the flat, arid desert of West Texas that coalesces into a singular culture that identifies with all aspects of itself, while remaining remote enough from the rest of the country to maintain a unique state of mind and way of life.  Keen does well to stick with this regional empathy in his lyrics, as opposed to someone like Pat Green who is becoming more famous nationally but risking his longevity writing pedestrian country tunes which are just ragged enough to maintain a connection with his rural roots, but not slick enough to garner much mainstream airplay.  Keen seems to know where his bread and butter is, which is all the more endearing to his fans.Finally I want to mention ""The Armadillo Jackal"", almost certainly the oddest song in Keen's catalog.  Over a pining bass-and-fiddle backbeat we hear the tale of a man who makes his living running down armadilloes on the farm-to-market roads crisscrossing central Texas.  These 'dilloes are sold for their shells to make boots and belts and the like, but that's not important.  The focus here is on the driver and his mindset, a relentless desperation attempting to collect as many kills as he can with his livelihood on the line, and the cruel twist fate plays on him one particularly bountiful night.  Keen certainly displayed his literary influences here, and it works both musically and lyrically, asserting itself as one of the more unheralded classics in the REK catalog. This is the quintessential Robert Earl, from thence all things come.  This  rough CD has all the themes that have become so familiar to his fans from  the lighthearted &quot;Swervin' in My Lane,&quot; to the intense  &quot;Armadillo Jackal,&quot;  he takes the listener through the gamut of  emotions, as he does on every album I have to admit I just leave this CD in the player and play it over and over and over....nearly every day! And it never grows old. Fabulous music from an exceptionally talented song writer. I've been a longtime REK fan, but keep coming back to this album. His earlier, acoustic stuff is his best -- songs that stand the test of time, stark arrangements that amplify his dark lyrics. ""Rollin' By"" and ""Willie"" show a young songwriter who is well on his way to penning modern Texas classics. From the sly humor of ""Swerving in My Lane"" to the dying cackle of the driver in ""Armadillo Jackal,"" this one's a must. This album started the progression that kept going through ""West Textures"" and ""Gringo Honeymoon"" and today's louder REK albums. As my most recent acquisition of REK's music (now at 7, but looking for ""Gringo Honeymoon"" and other earlier stuff than this one), it's already a favorite. My preferences lean towards acoustic music (yes, I'm kinda old and am declining in my need for adolescent screaming into a mike). This is just a perfect album with well-crafted, interesting lyrics and beautiful harmonies. REK is known for his humor, and this album has its share, and it's just fun to listen to. Glad I have it, and will listen to it often, especially when I need a boost. This music CD came to me opened with the CD scratched. CD case looks very worn out. No packing slip, no security plastic wrapping on the case either (like when you buy music in the store). This is the second CD I received that came to me like this.

544,1053,B000000EYM,"Along with the 1980 ""Skaggs & Rice"" album, this 1979 masterpiece is probably Ricky Skaggs' finest, sweetest album, packed with bouncy, jovial covers of great melodic oldies such as Lester Flatt's ""I'll Stay Around,"" Merle Travis's ""Sweet Temptation,"" and a jaunty run-through of a bluesy old Carter Family song, ""I Know What It Means To Be Lonesome."" And then there's the utterly heartbreaking, incandescent ""Could You Love Me One More Time,"" which gives a hint to the kind of heartsong gems that Skaggs would record in his surprising second act as a Top 40 hitmaker. ""Sweet Temptation"" is a real high point for traditionally-oriented musicmaking, a genuine Americana classic.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Country Music Guide) Ricky was already a Bluegrass GIANT, and a mainstay in Emmylou Harris' &quot;Hot Band&quot;.  His next solo project made him a Country Superstar. This album is a logical transition piece - accompanied by Bluegrass friends and masters like Tony Rice, Jerry Douglas and Bobby Hicks and country gunslingers like Albert Lee and his &quot;boss&quot; at the time - Ms Harris.  The Bluegrass cuts are classics - I'll Stay Around, I Know What It Means to be Lonesome.  The country cuts, such as the title cut &quot;Sweet Temptation&quot; are vibrant and accompanied by his wife and in-laws, The Whites.  I love this album, and if you like Bluegrass or Country or Ricky Skaggs, I predict you will as well. This is Ricky""s first big recording, he was just starting to work in Nashville, the players on this are all top notch, his buddie's!

546,1055,B000000EYW,"After Midnight might be the best Seldom Scene album of the Phil Rosenthal era (1977-1986). It was the third to feature Phil as lead singer and guitarist and while I prefer John Starling as front man for The Scene, I think Phil is a better guitar player. All of the musicians shine on this album, but it's Mike Auldridge and John Duffey who impress me the most. Mike absolutely nails Benny Goodman's ""Stompin at the Savoy,"" redefining it as a Dobro instrumental and Duffey's unconventional mandolin breaks are always a delight. After Midnight is one of the Seldom Scene's more pop-friendly releases, featuring not one, but two Eric Clapton hits, ""Lay Down Sally"" and J.J. Cale's ""After Midnight."" Both of these songs work surprisingly well in a bluegrass context and they were frequent crowd-pleasers in live performance.Listening to this album now, the track that really hits me is ""The Border Incident,"" also known as ""Spanish is the Loving Tongue."" John Duffey sings lead on this quiet, beautiful song and it's really nice to hear him sing the verses so softly and then wail out the tenor harmony like no one else could on the chorus. John Duffey was a one-in-a-million singer and personality and I really wish he were still around.While After Midnight may not quite be in the same league as earlier Seldom Scene classics like Old Train and Act II, it's a thoroughly enjoyable album and I really enjoyed revisiting it for this review.One final comment: The original album cover was a drawing of the band in blue silhouette. For the CD reissue, Sugar Hill used the actual photograph that the artist worked from. This is a superb album by one of the best bluegrass bands of all time. Beautiful vocals accompanied by masterful guitar, dobro, mandolin, banjo, and bass. I can't explain it, but you really should hear it.

I was re-discovering some of my old lps (that's vinyl to you youngsters out there) the other day, and I came upon this one. So I'm not really reviewing the CD per se, just the music, which is heavenly. I could not believe the high quality of the personnel: Guitars: James Burton &amp; Bernie Leadon; piano: Glen D. Hardin; dobro: Al Perkins; pedal steel: Jay Dee Maness; the rock solid drumming of Ron Tutt; &amp; on bass (one the best ever) Jerry Scheff.

Ever since &quot;Have you seen her face&quot; and &quot;Time between&quot; from the BYRDS &quot;Younger than Yesterday&quot; album, Mr. Hillman's singing ability has amazed me. Actually, considering his many talents, not only as a singer, but as a bass and mandolin player, and as a fine song-writer, I recommend any disc he's associated with, the exception being the 2nd Manassas disc. The only drawback to this disc is its shortness, about 29 minutes. Sugar Hill should have made this a two-fer with &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, also a sub 40 minute length. But if you are obsessing about adding more or collecting all of Hillman's discs, fesr not, for this is a top shelf, though short, recording. Rating docked one star for shortness. He is a good singer but the song selection did not impress me.  I need to add several more words to have this review accepted so the reader can ignore this last sentence. For my money this is Chris' best country CD; much better than Clear Sailin', Morning Sky or Slippin' Away. ""Wall Around your Heart"" is sure to bring a lump to anyone's throat. This was his pinnacle  in traditional country,before shifting to a more country/bluegrass style.""Running the Roadblocks"", which Chris wrote, reminds me of something that would be worthy of having been on a Flying Burrito Brothers or ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo"" album.

549,1063,B000000EZN,"Take 1 part Jonathan Edwards, songwriter, 1 part stellar musicianship by one of the tightest bluegrass bands EVER, and add 1 part John Duffey, the greatest tenor in bluegrass history, and you get this album. The title track will make you wish you were born in West Virginia, and if you were, it will make you cry. I was born in Chicago, and it makes me cry. Rough and Rocky, an old Flatt and Scruggs tune, is the best example ever of bluegrass harmonies, I played it 12 times in a row, and every time they rose together like a flock of birds in the final chorus, I got goosebumps everywhere. I still do. Duffey takes the lead on Sunshine, and as much as I adored hearing that song in its first run on my '64 Galaxy's radio, this version slays the old one. John Duffey is simply a God. Buy this, listen to it, and become a believer. Who would have thought that Jonathan Edwards would be singing Bluegrass?  His early songs were far closer to country rock. This album shows what a  fine tenor voice he has, ideal for Bluegrass.  Seldom Scene is a great  group, both vocally and instrumentally. Their voices blend flawlessly with  Edwards' and the instrumentals are superb.  &quot;Don't This Road Look  Rough And Rocky&quot;, the first song on the album, is worth the price of  the CD by itself. Hearing Edwards' old hit &quot;Sunshine&quot; done in  Bluegrass style was a shock at first, but it sounds like it was written for  Bluegrass harmonies.  Jonathan Edwards fans will find two new songs by  him, &quot;How Long Have I Been Waiting For You&quot; and &quot;Little  Hands&quot;. Seldom Scene and Bluegrass fans will find some very good  listening.  This is now my favorite Bluegrass album. Try it! I happen to be a big bluegrass and a slight Jonathan Edwards fan. Combining those things...makes for one of the most powerful and heartwarming CD's of bluegrass music you just might ever hear. There are reasons for its power, noted for their harmony, Seldom Scene keeps with that good standing providing the most incredible harmonies one can imagine. What makes it so unique is adding the mournful timbre of Jonathan. Musically this CD is tops, on a level with some of the best bluegrassers in the business. Not all songs are great, the remake of ""Sunshine"" (Edwards 60's tune) leaves something to be desired. However, that said, when you hear classic songs like 7 Daffodils, If I gave you and Little Hands, to name just a few, you are in serious bluegrass heaven. This is a must hear for anyone who likes bluegrass, Edwards, Seldom Scene or pure angelic harmonies. I saw J.Edwards somewhere back in the early 80's at a small Grange Hall in Brownsville, PA: my first time, and he sang most of the tunes from Blue Ridge.  I bought the cassette there---guess you know I almost wore it out by now. Over the years, I have turned a ""precious"" few on to it, and I listened to it again tonight (30? yrs. later).  What a great combination of voice and instruments to make your soul come ALIVE!  Sometimes you hit the right show at the right time and place---------now, it's on to Garcia/Grisman for more great music.  Peace The Seldom Scene is always prime bluegrass.  There's not a lot out there to compete for style and staying power.  Seldom Scene is one of those groups you listen to until you are sated, put the disk away, and one day find yourself digging around trying to find it.  They'd probably never have topped Scenic Roots, which was a great, if it weren't for Jonathan Edwards finding his place among them for this one release.  There's not a more haunting, lingering bluegrass recording anywhere than Jonathan Edwards and The Seldom Scene on Blue Ridge. My family and I absolutely love this recording of Jonathan Edwards and the Seldom Scene.  We have a tape of this that we have literally worn out.  When our little girls were born we sang to them the &quot;Little  Hands&quot; song that is on this CD.  Hopefully, to their delight, we will  be singing to them for years to come.  My husband played this tape for me  on our first date and I knew that if he liked music like this he was the  man for me!  I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves sentimental  songs and true bluegrass.  If you have not listened to bluegrass in the  past try this CD you will be hooked! This is one of my favorite albums of all time... I have it on vinyl and CD. The vocals are haunting and beautiful... Check out the title track. This album is bluegrass... but more. It achieves the near impossible task of allowing in non-traditional bluegrass instruments like piano, pedal steel and percussion without losing the focus on harmony and string driven music. I believe it is a must listen for fans of bluegrass and acoustic music... and did I mention the vocals... Oh BTW, I think this version of Edward's ""Sunshine"" is the definitive ""Sunshine. I love the seldom scene,one of my favorite groups of all time.this album with jonathon edwards is brillant in song selectionand hamonizing,a must have for any progressive bluegrass fan.ranks right up their with j.d.crowe and the new south. This album is one of my lifetime favorites.  I wore out my first copy (a tape from a long-lost lover), then the second tape (a copy of a friend's vinyl album).  Now I've bought several CD's; one for me and several for the people I love. Time to pay the musicians back..If you like bluegrass and if you like impeccable harmonizing, get this album.  I wish there were more by the same artists.Peace Skye","Folk Rock,Country,Bluegrass,Pop,Today's Country,Singer-Songwriters,Rock,Folk",take part jonathan edwards songwriter part stellar musicianship one tightest bluegrass bands ever add part john duffey greatest tenor bluegrass history get title make wish born west virginia make cry born chicago makes cry rough rocky old flatt scruggs tune best example ever bluegrass harmonies played times row every time rose together like flock birds final chorus got goosebumps everywhere still duffey takes lead sunshine much adored hearing first run galaxys radio version slays old one john duffey simply god buy listen become believer would thought jonathan edwards would singing bluegrass early far closer country rock shows fine tenor voice ideal bluegrass seldom scene g take part jonathan songwriter stellar musicianship bluegrass bluegrass bands bands add john john duffey greatest tenor bluegrass history title wish born west virginia virginia cry born chicago cry rough rocky old flatt tune best example harmonies played times row time rose flock birds final chorus got goosebumps lead sunshine adored hearing first run run galaxys radio radio version version slays old john john duffey simply god buy listen believer thought jonathan singing bluegrass early far closer country country rock rock shows fine tenor tenor voice voice ideal bluegrass seldom seldom scene scene
550,1065,B000000EZQ,"This is a classic album that I bought back when it came out on vinyl. I had always leaned towards the more modern bluegrass or NewGrass. This album single-handedly changed my ear. I'd always found Monroe, Flatt & Scruggs, the Stanleys and the old guard a little to &#34;authentic&#34; for my taste. This bridged that gap.Soul, drive, and emotion are elusive things. But this album has it all. I'm sure a lot of folks will think it either too hillbilly or not &#34;raw&#34; enough. But for me it made me understand what the real heart of bluegrass was and then I could comprehend what the old guard masters were trying to tell me. A first-rate bluegrass jamfest, steeped in the &quot;high lonesome&quot; style that cosmic cowboy Rowan learned straight from Bill Monroe, back when he was a member of the Blue Grass Boys in the mid-1960s.  Along for the ride are a slew of superpickers, including Alan O'Bryant, Sam Bush, Bill Keith and Richard Greene, all cheerfully galloping through a bunch of mountain music oldies.  This is a fun one, which anyone who doubts Rowan's hillbilly cred should check out.  Recommended! This is a great group of talent that really can play ""Bill Monroe Bluegrass"", who also knew and played with Bill, clearly loved his music and did it real justice. I'll bet Bill himself loved this CD. A great tribute to the Bill Monroe legacy. Another great recording from Peter Rowan, in a straight ahead bluegrass style - and no one does it better! With Sam Bush and Bill Keith in the band, it's a great band, too. Really good stuff! I'm giving it four stars only because there are other recordings by Peter that I love by Peter, but this is a first-rate CD!","Classic Country,Contemporary Folk,Country,Bluegrass,Pop,Traditional Folk,Today's Country,Folk",classic bought back came vinyl always leaned towards modern bluegrass newgrass single handedly changed ear id always found monroe flatt scruggs stanleys old guard little authentic taste bridged gap soul drive emotion elusive things im sure lot folks think either hillbilly raw enough made understand real heart bluegrass could comprehend old guard masters trying tell first rate bluegrass jamfest steeped quot high lonesome quot style cosmic cowboy rowan learned straight bill monroe back member blue grass boys mid along ride slew superpickers including alan obryant sam bush bill keith richard greene cheerfully galloping bunch mountain oldies fun one anyone classic bought came vinyl leaned modern bluegrass newgrass single handedly changed ear id found monroe scruggs old old guard guard authentic taste bridged gap soul drive emotion elusive things sure lot folks think raw understand real heart bluegrass comprehend old old guard guard masters trying tell first rate rate bluegrass steeped quot high lonesome quot style cosmic cowboy rowan learned straight bill bill monroe monroe member blue blue grass blue grass boys grass boys mid ride slew including sam sam bush bush bill bill keith keith keith richard richard richard greene greene cheerfully galloping bunch mountain oldies fun
